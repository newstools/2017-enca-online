PORT ELIZABETH - Zimbabwe claimed two wickets in three overs after South Africa made a solid start on the first day of a four-day, day-night Test at St George's Park on Tuesday. One session down in the four-day day/night Test and South Africa are 96/2 at tea, Markram on 44* with de Villiers alongside him on 15*.#SAvZIM LIVE: https://t.co/jxyBuyufHV pic.twitter.com/HLlzio1VdX South Africa were 96 for two at tea after stand-in captain AB de Villiers won the toss. Dean Elgar and Aiden Markram put on 72 for the first wicketÂ after weathering some tight new-ball bowling by Kyle Jarvis and new cap Blessing Muzarabani. Just when it seemed Zimbabwe's attack had lost its sting, Elgar clipped the third ball of Jarvis's second spell to Peter Moor at midwicket. Chris Mpofu followed up with the wicket of Hashim Amla, who made five before slapping a short ball to point, where Moor held his second catch. GOT HIM. Excellent catch by Mpofu to get the wicket of de Villiers off his own bowling for 53. SA 173/3 (46.5 ovs) as umpires call drinks. #SAvZIM #DayNightTest pic.twitter.com/8k3yiFBkHo South Africa were without regular captain Faf du Plessis, who had failed to recover fully from lower back and shoulder injuries, and fast bowler Dale Steyn, whose return from a broken shoulder is now likely to be in the first Test against India, starting in Cape Town on January 5. De Villiers, making a comeback to Test cricket, was 15 not out at tea. He was the captain in his most recent two Tests, against England in January 2016, but then suffered a long-term elbow injury before deciding to take a break from long-form cricket. Aiden Markram was on 44 not out. Zimbabwe included two new caps in batsman Ryan Burl and fast bowler Muzarabani. AFP

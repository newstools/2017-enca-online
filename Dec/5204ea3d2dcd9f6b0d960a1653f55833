JOHANNESBURG - The holiday season means people have more time on their hands and hopefully more energy to try out something new and creative in the kitchen. YouTube has a wealth of interesting channels dedicated to making food in different and delightful ways. Even if you don't try all the recipes on these channels, it's entertaining just to watch beautiful dishes being made all around the world. Moso Gourmet: This channel combines mostly dessert cooking with autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) triggers to relax and entertain.  How To Cook That: The miniature cooking trend didn't die in 2015 and this channel proves it. Miniature cooking isn't its only appeal as it has some decent recipes for baked goods.  Travel Thirsty: This channel shows the intricate creation of street food around the world in real-time videos. They show a good range of sweet and savoury dishes that will make you want to pack and go sample the dishes yourself. Jun's Kitchen: This channel combines the best parts of the internet, food and cats, as Jun prepares dishes to the attentive gaze of his two moggies, Haku and Poki. It's one of the most wholesome, relaxing cooking shows to watch and the recipes are simple enough to follow at home. Cooking with Dog: This YouTube cooking show is hosted by canine MC Francis and a mysterious Japanese chef whose real name is not disclosed. Over a range of seasons, they've explored desserts and savoury dishes, mostly from a Japanese food perspective.  Binging with Babish: Andrew Rea hosts a cooking show dedicated to discovering what the delectable (and occasionally horrible) foods from fiction actually taste like. eNCA

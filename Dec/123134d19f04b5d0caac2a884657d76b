But Jack lasted just 56 minutes before collecting his fourth red card in just 19 appearances since his Ibrox switch. Jack's crunching tackle on Aberdeen's Stevie May prompted his red card. But Danny Wilson's 14th-minute opener and Josh Windass's 63rd-minute strike were enough to seal Rangers' second win over Derek McInnes' team this week.

Teenager Frank Ross got one back for Aberdeen with a superb free-kick in the 65th minute. However, Aberdeen's defeat could yet end up being a forgettable farewell for McInnes. Rangers chairman Dave King is understood to be ready to offer the current Ibrox vacancy to their former midfielder McInnes. Speaking after the match, McInnes admitted Rangers had made life difficult for him by dragging out their job search for six weeks since Pedro Caixinha's exit. "I made my position clear a few weeks ago and this has been ongoing. It just feels as if it has dragged on and on," he said. "I'm not happy with how things have played out. "Everybody seems to be in the know and every other day there is someone giving an opinion on my future and what Rangers are doing. "It's not been as straightforward as it should have been the last few weeks." AFP

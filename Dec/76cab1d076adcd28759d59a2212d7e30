JOHANNESBURG - Accreditation of ANC delegates has officially closed at the University of Johannesburg (UJ). However, ANC deputy secretary-general, Jessie Duarte says the issue of accreditation is not yet finalised.  The conference has, however, kicked off with President Jacob Zuma addressing delegates.  Some disgruntled party members want to lodge complaints about their branches, which are not meant to be at the conference. Some are even saying they want their branch delegates to be removed from the gathering. The disputes are mostly about the legality of the members representing them. eNCA

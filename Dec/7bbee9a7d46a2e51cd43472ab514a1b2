JOHANNESBURG – The SA Rugby Union (Saru) on Friday confirmed it will not make a decision on the future of Springbok coach Allister Coetzee until next year.  Speculation has been rife about the future of Coetzee in his position after yet another poor year in charge of the Springboks. Coetzee has won just 11 of 25 Tests in his time in charge, for a dismal 44 percent win percentage. “To assist media in their reporting and in light of considerable speculation, please be advised that SA Rugby will not be in a position to respond to questions regarding that speculation on the coaching of the national team until the New Year,” Saru said in a statement on Friday.  “A number of meetings and reviews are in progress on all national teams after which plans for all teams in 2018 will be confirmed.” African News Agency

READ: Zuma saddened by Robbie Malinga’s death According to reports on TshisaLive, Malinga, who guided many of South Africa’s music talents to success, was Ndaba’s mentor and the two were planning a studio session before Malinga passed on. "Robbie knew about Mthokozisi even before Idols and he said that he wanted to work with him. After Idols he said again that he wanted to work with him. We were busy setting up a studio session before Robbie died and if we had known we would have organised it earlier to get the recording done in time,” the site quoted Ndaba’s manager Lwazi Mdladla. eNCA

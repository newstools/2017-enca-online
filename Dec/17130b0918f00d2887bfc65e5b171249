JOHANNESBURG - The contest for the African National Congress (ANC)’s top job has reached fever pitch with the national elective conference kicking off in under a week at Nasrec, south west of Johannesburg. The hotly contested battle is likely to see Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma going head-to-head for the governing party’s presidency. But just who are the men and women who will form part of the successful candidate’s ticket to make up the party’s top six? eNCA takes a look at the various candidates who could form part of the Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma slate. (By: Dennis Georgiannis.) Team Ramaphosa  The current ANC deputy president has broken away with protocol and has been pretty public about the list of candidates that will accompany him should he get the Luthuli House corner office. Team Dlamini-Zuma  There has been some speculation as to who President Jacob Zuma’s former wife and the ex-African Union chairperson Dlamini-Zuma will have on her slate. She has not been as public about who will join her in the ANC top six, unlike the Ramaphosa camp. Staunch allies and leading organisations in the Zuma faction, the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) and ANC Youth League (ANCYL), previously indicated who they wanted to form part of Dlamini-Zuma’s ticket. eNCA

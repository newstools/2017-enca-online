JOHANNESBURG - A 4-year-old Chicago boy has become an internet sensation after reading 100 books in one night. Caleb Green's father posted a note on Facebook saying his son had set himself "a crazy goal" but he and his wife couldn't bring themselves to tell him it was unrealistic.  "So here we are after searching the WHOLE house to find 100 books! ... He even invited his grandmother to help him!!!" When the Green family realised they didn't have 100 books, friends popped by to bring him some more.  His father kept up running commentary on Facebook, updating friends and family on how far Caleb was in his marathon.  When the little boy started losing interest, his parents reminded him to follow through with his goal, gave him some water and let him have a dance break.  And finally, Caleb reached 100 books.  In an interview, Caleb said he wants to be a basketball player, an astronaut, and a ninja turtle when he grows up.  eNCA

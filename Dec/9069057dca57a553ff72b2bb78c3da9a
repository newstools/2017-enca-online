The JSE is now trying to obtain more information after nearly R183-billion of market value was wiped off the local market due to allegations of financial irregularities at the furniture retailer. Steinhoff owns popular retailers Pep, Ackermans, HiFi-Corporation, and Incredible Connection, amongst others.  eNCA

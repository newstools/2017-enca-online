JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma came out guns blazing in the opening session of the 54th ANC elective congress, taking aim at the media, the judiciary, ANC members engaged in 'lawfare', NGOs, business and the tripartite alliance. On the party’s so-called ‘lawfare’, a term used in conference documents to refer those fighting internal battles through court fighting internal battles through court, Zuma said the party frowns upon internal matters being taken to court. Zuma added the issue of members going to court must be discussed because “it’s gradually eroding the authority of the ANC.” To small cheers and claps, Zuma said it is a sickness to take the party to court. “Judges shouldn’t give directive of the direction of our movement … Those who take the party to court are automatically out of the party,” he said. The president also took swipe at the media, saying that it is controlled by forces hostile to the ANC. “We should also be mindful of the fact that the media is an active participant with vested interest rather than an impartial and fair observer on ANC matters.” He spared the tripartite alliance no blushes. “In recent months, we have seen our alliance partners marching alongside the right wing calling for the president to step down, even going as far as barring the president from the events,” Zuma said referring to being booed at a May Day rally. “I tried my best,” Zuma concluded. “I bear no grudge."

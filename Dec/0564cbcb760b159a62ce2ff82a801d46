JOHANNESBURG - A crowd of Jozi’s young influentials tapped into the legacy of 90’s rave culture hosted by popular tequila brand, Jose Cuervo. The event was hosted at an underground party held at The Station in Newtown.  Partygoers carried out nostalgic memories of the 90’s rave culture, and the gathering saw the youth rebelling against the norm and taking nightlife culture into their own hands.  Grime and Gqom beats pounded through the abandoned concrete space while neon strobe lights lit up flashes of danger tape and yellow road barriers.   UK hip hop artist Wiley, famously known as the Godfather of Grime, headlined the event and supporting acts included the UK’s Skinny Macho and SA’s K-$, DJ Lag and Uncle Party Time.     Seize The City kicks off a progressive and rebellious Jose Cuervo nightlife movement and partygoers can look out for another underground takeover in 2018. - Contributor: Khumo Pulumo eNCA

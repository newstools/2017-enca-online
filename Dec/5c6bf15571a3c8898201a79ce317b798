JOHANNESBURG – Pro-Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma supporters were in high spirit on Saturday as they waited for the start of the much-anticipated 54th African National Congress (ANC) elective conference at Nasrec, Johannesburg. They were singing and chanting songs when delegates gathered for a mass caucus ahead of the start of the conference. Phakama Nkosazana, ixesha lifikile, which translates to 'rise Nkosazana, the time has come'.  Dlamini-Zuma's camp, dubbed as the Premier League, gathered to address delegates with notable speakers including North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo and Mpumalanga’s Davis Mabuza. There was not much of a hype from Cyril Ramaphosa's camp. The #CR17 camp from KwaZulu-Natal had placards written "KZN no PEC CR17." eNCA

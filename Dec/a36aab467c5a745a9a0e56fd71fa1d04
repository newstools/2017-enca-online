Catalonia's separatists won an overall majority on Thursday in regional elections called by Spain’s government. Guardiola, who defended Catalan citizens' right to vote in the October referendum that was declared illegal by Spain, hopes this can pave the way to a better future. "The most important thing is a lot of people voted, I think more than 81 percent, so it's really amazing," he said. QUALITY: Pep Guardiola leads the @ManCity fans chant. ----

Yesterday was a legal election and the people of Catalonia, with the vote, expressed what they are. "What I want is the people who are still in jail to go out as soon as possible because it's not fair, and the politicians can start to make politics. So, please, start to talk. "Forget about the judges and try to do the best for Catalonia and Spain. That is what everybody wants." AFP

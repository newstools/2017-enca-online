LONDON - Australia's Ashes-winning opener Cameron Bancroft has signed to play for Somerset next season as the English county side target trophies following a disappointing season. The 25-year-old, who hit the headlines when it emerged he had been on the receiving end of a playful headbutt from England's Jonny Bairstow, has played all three Tests in the current series. He scored an unbeaten 82 on debut in Brisbane, also featuring in victories in Adelaide and Perth. Bancroft, who plays for Western Australia and Perth Scorchers Down Under, has 11 centuries to his name in 69 first-class appearances. He is being lined up to feature in four-day and 50-over cricket, but not the NatWest T20 Blast. "I'm really excited to be joining a county with so much potential," said Bancroft. "There's a long history of Australians doing well at Taunton, so hopefully I can add my name to that list." "He has come very highly recommended and will fit seamlessly into our environment," said Somerset's director of cricket Andy Hurry. "This will be a key ingredient to us achieving our aspirations of winning silverware." Somerset finished sixth in division one of the county championship this year, narrowly avoiding relegation to the second tier. AFP

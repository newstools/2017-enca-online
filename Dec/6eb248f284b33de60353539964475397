JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has filed papers in the North Gauteng High Court, appealing the ruling that he is too conflicted to appoint a judge to head up an inquiry into state capture.  Earlier in December, a full bench of the North Gauteng High Court found that Zuma must set up the inquiry into state capture within 30 days as set out in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report.  President Zuma quite determined that any evidence linking him to #StateCapture and allegations that he essentially d ferried his powers to choos Ministers to the Guptas, failed to take action when confronted by Jonas, Mentor claims etc, etc, must be investigated by PP. pic.twitter.com/j1HpJ3PPwU The court also enforced the Public Protector's recommendation that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng be the one to appoint someone to head the inquiry, instead of the president because Zuma is implicated in her report. Zuma also argues the court erred in finding that he is personally liable for the costs of his failed bid to stop the release of the Public Protector's State of Capture report, saying he did not join the case in his personal capacity.  President Zuma's lawyers arguing High Court was wrong to say he was ill-advised and reckless to challenge @ThuliMadonsela3 #StateCapture report - when Constitutional Court has stated that government should approach courts when there is uncertainty over PP remedial action. pic.twitter.com/y2qLiUtRr6 Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said President Jacob Zuma had acted "unreasonably" and had been "reckless" by applying for a review of the report.

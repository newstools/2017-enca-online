JOHANNESBURG - Limpopo ANC chairperson Stan Mathabatha says he is confident a solution will be found for more than 60 "missing" votes in the election of the top party officials. "I have written a letter personally to the steering commission but a solution must be found because people cannot come here without appearing on the voters' roll. One [of them] is leader of the veterans' league [the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association] in a province." READ: ANC meets amid concerns over vote counting and allocation of top six positions According to reports, between 63 and 68 delegates who were registered to vote at the conference had discovered that their names were not on the voters' roll. Their votes were not included in the final tallies for the top six executives. This would most affect the narrow margin of just 24 votes that made Ace Magashule the ANC secretary-general ahead of Senzo Mchunu. An unscheduled meeting of the steering committee was called on Tuesday to discuss the matter. "Knowing the ANC, I know there'll be a solution to this problem," Mathabatha said. Voting for additional national executive members was delayed but got under way on Tuesday evening. eNCA

He claims paramedics shouted at the mother instead of providing medical care. "We called the ambulance, we thought they would come quicker, they didn't. Instead of entering, they refused to enter. Why do you refuse to take the child, why do you refuse to put the child in a structure?" he said while briefing the media outside the Alberton police station in southern Johannesburg. The paramedics have refuted Motsoeneng's claims and said the child was already dead when they arrived at the church. eNCA

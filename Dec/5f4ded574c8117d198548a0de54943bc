NEWCASTLE – KwaZulu Natal Transport and Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has announced a total shut down of taxi operations in Ladysmith. Kaunda said the Sizwe Taxi Association and the Klipriver Taxi Association have been prohibited from operating in the area for six months. Over 60 people have killed in the area, including 11 people -- in the latest incident last month where the Klipriver Taxi Association's deputy chairperson was murdered. The violence is thought to be linked to an ongoing conflict between the two taxi associations, Sizwe and Klipriver.

Kaunda says that a plan has been developed to rope in busses and private vehicles to commute passengers in the area including taxi associations which have an agreement with Klipriver will operate.
	“The safety of our passengers who will be commuting by buses during this period is critical,” said Kaunda. “The South African Police Services and traffic officers will maintain visibility especially in highly affected communities to make sure that no taxis are operating illegally outside this decision and that bus operations run smoothly without any disruptions.” eNCA

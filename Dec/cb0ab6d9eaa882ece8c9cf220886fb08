JOHANNESBURG – Flowers are in full bloom, the heat is in overdrive and we’re deep into #KeDezemba, which for many signals the traditional Christmas family lunch. The major difference between South Africa and the rest of the world is we celebrate ours slightly differently. Twitter users have complied their favourites on how we celebrate the festive day. The term BOB, aka Bring and Braai, is a lost term during the season, as meat lovers share their different pork chops on steaks on the fire. And what is an African family without Choice Assorted biscuits? Let’s not forget the Ultramel custard fetish, the country's number one choice in pudding. After a dash of these desserts at a family gathering, it is imperative that you close off the year on a good note. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The Umkhoto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) lashed out on Saturday at the North Gauteng High Court ruling that set aside the appointment of Shaun Abrahams as national director of public prosecutions. In a scathing statement, the MKMVA said the ruling “is serious judicial over-reach by the judiciary, and comes perilously close to a judicial coup against our democratically elected president” READ: NPA to appeal court ruling that Abrahams appointment was invalid The court's decision went against the legal maxim that every citizen was innocent until found guilty by a court of law, the association said. The court ruled on Friday that Abrahams should vacate his position and that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should appoint a replacement within 60 days as President Jacob Zuma was too “conflicted” to do so. “It must be pointed out that President Zuma has not been found guilty of any crime at all, yet with this outrageous decision the Northern Gauteng High Court behaves towards him as if he is already found guilty and sentenced," the MKMVA said. The ruling stripped Zuma of his rights as both a citizen and head of state. READ: Zuma to appeal ruling invalidating Shaun Abrahams appointment The MKMVA alleged that the ruling was intended to favour Ramaphosa’s candidacy for ANC president. “MKMVA is left with the distinct impression that this judgment has the intention to influence the outcome of the current contestation for the ANC presidency. There can be no doubt that the judges who took this contentious decision are fully aware that they have done so barely a week from the start of the ANC’s national elective conference, and that Ramaphosa is a prominent candidate contesting for the position of ANC president.” The veterans' association applauded Zuma and the National Prosecuting Authority for appealing the ruling. eNCA

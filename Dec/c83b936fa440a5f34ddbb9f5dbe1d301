JOHANNESBURG – Uber will continue operating on London streets a bit longer, pending a ruling by a British court. The ride hailing service is appealing government’s decision not to renew its licence in one of its busiest markets. The Westminster Magistrate’s Court will decide next week if trade unions and London’s taxi drivers associations can intervene in the matter, with formal proceedings for the appeal only expected to begin as late as June 2018.

It will be business as usual for the world’s largest taxi operator, so long as its appeal is pending. eNCA

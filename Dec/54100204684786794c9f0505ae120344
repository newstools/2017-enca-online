JOHANNESBURG - Some South African fathers have been taken to court for neglecting to take responsibility for their children. Other deny the paternity of their children, resulting in shows like Utatakho. But a group of South African fathers, using the hashtag #DaddiesWithTheirKids, have taken to Twitter and are trending for all the right reasons. Users posted their pictures showing off their relationship with the seedlings. It is hoped all fathers can adopt a behaviour that promotes love and responsibility. eNCA

NAIROBI - Kenya booked their place in the Cecafa Challenge Cup final after an extra-time goal secured a 1-0 victory over Burundi at the Moi stadium in Kisumu on Thursday. The game was deadlocked at 0-0 after regulation time, but four minutes into extra-time, midfielder Whyvonne Isuza ended the stalemate when he unleashed an unstoppable drive to send the hosts to the final. But it was Burundi who created the early chances. Dangerman Laudit Mavugo came close to giving them the lead in the 13th minute, only for his free-kick to hit cross-bar, with the Kenyan keeper well beaten Minutes later Kenyan defender Musa Mohammed nearly gave away a penalty when he brought down the speedy Burundian midfielder Tresor Ndikumana inside the box, only to be flagged offside. Muhammed, who had a busy afternoon in the three-man Kenyan defence, is doubtful for the final on Sunday after suffering a knee injury in the 74th minute. Kenya will play the winner of Friday's second semi-final between defending champions, Uganda and Zanzibar. AFP

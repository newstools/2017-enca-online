JOHANNESBURG - The Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearings  continued on Tuesday, with Gauteng's suspended head of health, Dr Barney Selebano, taking to the stand. Nomsa Radebe next witness, her brother Mandla was among the patients moved from #LifeEsidimeni pic.twitter.com/kh0rGUESZ5 Selebano said his department was always under financial pressure and costs were always the biggest challenge for any HOD in the country. Relatives of psychiatric patients who survived the Life Esidimeni relocation project want reassurances the tragedy will never be repeated. Nomsa was not informed when her brother was moved from #LifeEsidimeni. She eventually tracked him down after searching for him in Hammanskraal.
		
		The Bopholong NGO was beautiful inside and out. But her brother and other patients were kept in a locked outside room. 143 people died and dozens more remain unaccounted for after the Gauteng Health Department moved the patients to unlicensed NGOs. #LifeEsidimeni Arbitration hearing expected to get underway shortly. Families of survivors will take to the stand this morning. pic.twitter.com/TXdnrbH5ta “When our beloved were moved from Life Esidimeni it was because the contract was not extended, now that my sister and others are moved back to Life Esisidimeni, a concern is this, does the government have a contract with Life Esidimeni now and for how long so that we know that we are safe, we don’t want to hear again that it is closing. Is it cheaper now'', said Lesego Baloyi, Relative of Patient. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - With less than two weeks to go before the ANC’s elective congress in Nasrec, Johannesburg, analysts say the race for the party’s top position is still too close to call. eNCA's Xoli Mngambi spoke to two political commentators about how they see events unfolding at Nasrec.  READ: Motshekga breaks ranks with Women's League, backs Ramaphosa Dumisani Hlophe said the two leading groupings in the succession race - those behind Cyril Ramaphosa and those behind Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma - seem to be "on relative equal strength." "It's difficult to predict a decision – it’s about 50/50 from where I’m sitting," says Hlope.   Ivor Sarakinsky said in politics it becomes hard to untangle what people are camouflaging and what their real position is.   Neither one of the commentators believe that Mpumalanga is the much-touted "kingmaker" in the election.  They point to the fact that alliance party members are playing their cards close to their chests.   Both Hlope and Sarakinsky maintained a lot of lobbying and campaigning will still be taking place at the conference to secure votes for the ANC's top position.  They point out that voting takes place via secret ballot at the congress, which means that provincial positions on nominations may not mean that much after all.  INFOGRAPHIC: How does voting work at the ANC conference?  eNCA

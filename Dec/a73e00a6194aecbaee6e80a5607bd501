JOHANNESBURG – Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown addressed Eskom’s special general meeting on Friday. Brown appointed new board members recently. She said the appointment of the board in three phases is a pragmatic response to the well-publicised challenges Eskom has faced. READ: Eskom board approved There are many controversies surrounding the parastatal. The Helen Suzman Foundation is leading a lawsuit against President Jacob Zuma and members of his cabinet, including Brown. The foundation revealed that the civil claim aims to recover billions of rands it says was stolen from Eskom. Nersa is also expected to announce their decision on Friday afternoon whether or not to grant a tariff increase. On Friday, Brown had some words of caution for the Eskom board. “Unlike those who serve on boards of private companies, you will be regarded with suspicion and mistrust. They make accounting mistakes while you are susceptible to corruption, capture, greed, and malice. Who they associate with is inconsequential. They call it lobbying. You must be careful who you play golf with because it will be used as evidence against you," said Lynne.  She added: "In the coming months, more new members, with appropriate expertise from the business sector, will join the Board. "Several strong candidates have already been identified and expressed their willingness to re-build the Eskom brand. "By the time we convene Eskom's annual AGM in June 2018, we will have ensured that investigative and disciplinary processes into alleged malfeasance involving some of Eskom's senior members have been completed, and the company will be fully equipped to execute its mandate under a new chairperson." eNCA

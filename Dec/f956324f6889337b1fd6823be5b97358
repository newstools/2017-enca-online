JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in the North West has distanced itself from three ANC members who were arrested for possession of an unlicensed firearm on Sunday. They were among six men who appeared in court on Monday morning after being arrested in a Nasrec parking area on Sunday. They'd been consuming alcohol, and a firearm was found in the vehicle they were sitting in. The men were detained at Booysens police station. Five of them have since been released. The sixth will remain in custody until 29 December, when he'll apply for bail. He's been charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm. eNCA

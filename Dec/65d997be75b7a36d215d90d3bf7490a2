JOHANNESBURG – Embattled African National Congress (ANC) Free State politician Ace Magashule says he is confident that Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma will walk away the winner in the succession race. He was speaking at the ANC's registration station at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) just before heading to Nasrec for the conference. The Race: Some FS ANC members unhappy with Magashule On Friday, the Free State's provincial leadership was barred from attending this weekend’s proceedings as Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) members.  WATCH: Free State ANC PGC ruled unlawful Also on Friday, the provincial elective conference held in KwaZulu-Natal was also ruled null and void. A court found 38 branch general meetings in the North West were also invalid. All three court rulings were seen as a blow for Dlamini-Zuma's chances of becoming the next ANC president. She faces stiff opposition from Cyril Ramaphosa for the governing party’s top job. eNCA

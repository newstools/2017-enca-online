JOHANNESBURG - The South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) says suspended Gauteng Health Department officials have been made scapegoat in the Life Esidimeni debacle. At least 143 psychiatric patients died after they were moved from Life Esidimeni to ill-equipped NGOs in 2016. WATCH: Esidimeni hearings to wrap up before adjourning to 2018 "In my view it was not about Dr Barney Selebano or Dr Manamela who override the whole thing. I think it all came on top to say let's stop giving the money to these people that they are using to look after our patients and unfortunately that really did not work out because people realised that it was not about money," says Dr Jan Chabalala, Sadag Board Member. Suspended Gauteng health HOD, Dr Barney Selebano, on Friday apologised to the families who lost their loved ones in the tragedy. Selebano signed off on the project to move psychiatric patients to unregistered NGOs and also issued licenses to NGOs knowing that people had died there under suspicious circumstances. eNCA

Suspended chief financial officer Anoj Singh was to answer to the MPs earlier but submitted a 400-page document late on Monday night. He was roundly reprimanded for disrespecting the inquiry members and told to go home. The inquiry was suspended last after the Eskom board members said they needed more time. But it's unclear which board members will be in the hot seat. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, three former Eskom CEOs, former board chairman Zola Tsotsi and the company's legal head, Suzanne Daniels, are just some of the people who have appeared before the inquiry.

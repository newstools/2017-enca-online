JOHANNESBURG – South Africa claimed their sixth regional title after a 2-1 victory over Lesotho in the final of the Cosafa Under-20 Championships at the Arthur Davies Stadium in Kitwe, Zambia, on Saturday. Lyle Foster and Kamogelo Sambo bagged the goals for the South Africans, while Rethabile Mokokoane replied with an excellent long-range effort for Lesotho, who remain without a victory in the competition after three final defeats. North African guest nation Egypt finished third when they beat fellow invitees Uganda 3-1 in the third-place playoff earlier in the day. South Africa were ahead inside five minutes when Foster scored his third goal of the tournament, with a neat finish into the bottom corner after Luvuyo Mkatshana had been tackled in the box.  Amajita made it 2-0 just before halftime when Sambo bundled the ball home, after Keanu Cupido’s close-range effort had been blocked by substitute Lesotho goalkeeper Silase Kopano. Lesotho almost found a way back into the game late in the first half when Bonang Mohapi’s free-kick struck a post and bounced away to safety.

Lesotho might have equalised soon afterwards when Mokoteli Mohapi found himself with an empty net to aim at, but he side-footed his shot wide. The Player of the Tournament award went to Mkatshana, while Shaban claimed the Golden Boot. Monaheng Ramalefane was named the Goalkeeper of the Tournament prize, while Lesotho picked up the Fair Play Award. African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - The ANC has lashed out at the new political party, the African Democratic Change for using ANC colours in its logo. Former ANC MP Makhosi Khoza launched her party last week. "We have no issue with people starting political parties. We are living in a multiparty democracy therefore there could be other reasons why they start political parties. It enriches democracy," says Zizi Kodwa, ANC Spokesperson. WATCH: Khoza resignation greeted with regret "But we get more concerned and worry when appropriable the brand the colours and the logo of the ANC," he says. "We have seen that in the recent past where people wanted to deliberately confused voters of the ANC for an example I can give you an immediate answer the AIC which is a small party of Matatiele, now it has foot prints everywhere, Ekurhuleni in Tshwane. Even as ADC as a name it is deliberate so that it has a resemblance of the ANC," says Kodwa. "So this is nothing else other than somebody who is not confident to their own identity. They do not have their own identity. They still have the love back of the African National Congress". eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The Presidency has dismissed reports that the South African Airways (SAA) will be moved out of National Treasury to the Department of Transport. “The Presidency has noted media reports suggesting that Government has taken a decision to move South African Airways out of National Treasury to the Department of Transport.
	The reports are incorrect. No such decision had been taken by Government,” read a media statement.

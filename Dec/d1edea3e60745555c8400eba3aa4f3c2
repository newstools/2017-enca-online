JOHANNESBURG - The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) opened a docket of inquiry for criminal charges against embattled furniture giant Steinhoff in Stellenbosch on Saturday. The organisation said it would also write to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane asking her to initiate a comprehensive inquiry into asset management companies sub-contracted by the Public Investment Corporation to assess if they "are not also involved in alleged acts of economic terrorism”.

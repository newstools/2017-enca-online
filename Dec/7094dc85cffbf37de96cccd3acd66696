JOHANNESBURG - Louis Oosthuizen picked up a finger injury and was forced to pull out of the Joburg Open on Wednesday. The tournament at Randpark Golf Club starting on Thursday, was set to feature SAâ€™s top-ranked player, at 23rd in the world, but a freak incident left Oosthuizen with no choice but to withdraw. The 35-year-old jammed his fingers in an airport trolley on his way to Johannesburg, and on Wednesday was still unable to grip a golf club with his swollen fingers. African News Agency

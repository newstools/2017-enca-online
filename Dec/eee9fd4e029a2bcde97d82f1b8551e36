JOHANNESBURG - Former academic and political activist, Professor Richard van der Ross has been laid to rest. The 96-year-old died last week. At his funeral, tribute was paid to the role he played during apartheid, especially in making tertiary education accessible to the marginalised. Van der Ross will be remembered as the first coloured rector of the University of the Western Cape (UWC), as well as for his lifelong struggle to make education – especially at the university – accessible to the underprivileged. According to professor Tyrone Pretorius, UWC rector: “Professor Van der Ross identity is closely linked to the identity of UWC and as many speakers said here today, his legacy really is when he labelled UWC as the university of the working class, recognising that education is the way out of poverty.” READ: De Lille pays tribute to Prof Richard van der Ross In 1998, Van der Ross was awarded the Freedom of the City of Cape Town. He shared this accolade with former president Nelson Mandela,  Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu and Ahmed Kathrada. His friend of many years  Franklin Sonn said Van der Ross never made excuses for who he was. “I admired him immensely because he was a rights person. He was a person who believed in human spirit. and in the mind, rather than ideologies on nationalism ... I consider him easily as one of the greatest South Africans of our time.” Van de Ross leaves behind two children, four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. eNCA

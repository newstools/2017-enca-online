JOHANNESBURG - Energy regulator Nersa announced its decision on Eskom's tariff hike application. #Nersa has approved Eskom's R190,348 billion application. This results in a 5.23% tarrif hike.
		
		Nersa Chairperson Jacob Modise says reasons for the decision will be published in due course. #EskomTarrif The embattled power utility wanted a 19.9 percent increase from next year. #Eskom had applied for a tarrif hike of 19.9% which translates to an allowable revenue of R219.514 billion. #Nersa has instead only approved a total revenue of R190.348 billion which results in a 5.23% increase.
		
		This is a one year tarrif application. READ:Â Eskom justifies 20 percent tariff hike Eskom says the hike it has requested would help it turn its financial fortunes around. But a major price hike could lead to sales dropping even further. Modise: Going forward, we will not allow a one year application. Companies cannot plan around a one year hike. They've given reasons for it this year but going forward "there's no reason why eskom shouldn't make a multi-year application."#Nersa #Eskom eNCA

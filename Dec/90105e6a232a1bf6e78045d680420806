PRAGUE - Former Arsenal midfielder and Czech national side playmaker Tomas Rosicky ended his professional career on Wednesday after years of injuries often kept him off the pitch. Rosicky, 37, came through at Sparta Prague, where he is now also finishing his playing days, before moving to Borussia Dortmund in 2001 and to Arsenal in 2006 where he played for a decade. Rosicky, dubbed "Little Mozart" for his playmaking abilities, started 105 games for the national team, making him the third most-capped player in the country's history.

"My body was telling me for a long time that it does not want (to do it) any more," he told a news conference. "I would probably have nothing to offer my team mates and Sparta." "I lived through beautiful moments but unfortunately also terribly negative ones," he added. "Without even thinking about, I would immediately do it again."

He returned to Sparta Prague in 2016 and appeared 12 times for the side.Â  Reuters

JOHANNESBURG – Local eateries and pubs in Soweto are bracing for big business as the African National Congress (ANC) begins its National Elective Conference (NEC) in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg. Restaurants like Sakhumzi on the famous Vilakazi Street have started seeing a number of people flocking to the pub wearing ANC regalia. “We have started seeing members of the ANC already, but they are coming as individuals and we hope more will come,” general manager Joshua Jumo said when asked about the coming weekend. “The restaurant is a home for all… but the conference will be a bonus.” During previous events in Johannesburg, ANC big shots were spotted dining on Vilakazi Street. The difference this time, according to Jumo, is the period of the year in which this event is held. "Previous ANC event were not the same as this time… and it was not as busy." Not all eateries and pubs are at an advantage though. While business may be booming for some, others are not looking at capitalising on the ANC event.

Those eyeing to capitalise are however ready for the gathering. “We beefed-up our team with students as from the beginning of the season, looking at how we were going to be busy, not for the conference alone. We do it every year,” Jumo added. “The only challenge we are facing is that we can only accommodate a certain number of guests. If we could stretch our capacity, we would just do that.” eNCA

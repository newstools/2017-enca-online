PORT ELIZABETH – The Knights and Highveld Lions both suffered a blow in their bid to reach the Ram Slam T20 Challenge playoffs after their match at the Mangaung Oval had to be abandoned due to rain in Bloemfontein on Friday.
	
	Both sides were looking for victory from the game, but only 13 overs were possible following delays for thunder and then rain, which eventually arrived and never left. The visitors had won the toss and opted to bowl first, a decision that looked a good one after their bowlers kept the home batsmen mainly in check.

However, the rain did not allow him to kick on as the match was declared a no result leaving the two sides to share the spoils.
	
	Both now move on to 12 points apiece, with the hosts also in action on Sunday when they play the Titans in the first leg of a double-header in Port Elizabeth. African News Agency

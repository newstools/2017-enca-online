JOHANNESBURG - United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader General Bantu Holomisa on Tuesday said his party will condemn any rollout of a state of emergency. He says if it happens after 2019, South Africans would need to take responsibility for voting for the ANC despite several warnings. Justice Malala spoke to the UDM leader on The Justice Factor. The Presidency is denying reports that itâ€™s drafting new regulations to deal with any potential state of emergency in the country.

CAPE TOWN – Residents of Cape Town will be hit by level 6 water restrictions from the new year to avoid running out of the scant resource. About 200,000 households are using more than 10,500 litres a day and could be fitted with a water management device, the City of Cape Town said in a statement on Thursday. At level 5, households were allowed to use up to 20,000 litres a day.

City spokesperson Zara Nicholson said the new water restrictions would help to avoid “Day Zero”, when taps run completely dry. “The implementation of the latest water restrictions for the Western Cape water supply system follows the directive by the National Department of Water and Sanitation requiring urban users to reduce their water usage by 45%, and agricultural users to reduce consumption by 60%,” Nicholson said. The daily water usage limit will stay at 87 litres per person per day.

Our hot and dry summer is here. We are not going to be given many more chances to really reduce our water usage. We have to do it now”, she said. De Lille applauded water users who had cut down their water usage, but said those who had not “continue to place us all in danger”. Additional reporting eNCA African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - Following the adoption of credentials for the African National Congress (ANC)'s 54th elective conference, the party will officially table the nominations for its top jobs.  The conference is running very late, having started late on Saturday when the National Executive Committee (NEC) first met about three court rulings on Friday that had a direct impact on delegates and who would be allowed to vote.  In addition, the issue of credentials and accreditation took some time to finalise, leading to further delays.  INFOGRAPHIC: ANC candidates vying for top job On Saturday, one of the presidential candidates, ANC Chairperson Baleka Mbete endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to become the next president of the party. On Sunday, the party opted not to have two deputy presidents. According to sources inside the ANC 54th elective conference plenary, which is taking place behind closed doors, a bid to introduce a second deputy was aimed at creating a compromise in the party's slate politics. eNCA

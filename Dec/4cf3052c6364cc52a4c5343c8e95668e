JOHANNESBURG - The Zanzibar Border crossing to Botswana is closed until further notice because the Limpopo River is flooding. The Home Affairs Department says itâ€™s not safe for travellers. Officials are advising travellers to use the Platjan Border as an alternative. Meanwhile, traffic is building up at the Beitbridge Border Post to Zimbabwe. It is one of the busiest border crossings for holidaymakers on the continent. eNCA

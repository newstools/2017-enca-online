South Africa has been plagued by what appears to be never-ending corruption scandals. State capture at state-owned enterprises and blue chip companies embroiled in fraud and dodgy deals. In response, lobby group Corruption Watch released a satirical animated video highlighting the effects of corruption and how taxpayers and the poor are the ones who end up paying the cost.  * This video contains some strong language.

JOHANNESBURG - SACP First Deputy Secretary Solly Mapaila says President Jacob Zuma has played a huge part in destroying the economy. He was reacting to Zuma's address at the opening of the ANC elective conference. READ: Zuma the worst leader ANC has ever had: SACP “In the crumbling of our economy, in the crumbling of the South African project of nation building. He played a massive role in destroying what is dear to us, in destroying the essence of the National Democratic Revolution and therefore it’s something that going forward we need to properly discuss with the new ANC leadership and I think that conference will be much clearer about the programs, about it's intentions and if it reaffirms some of the things he spoke about which he completely does not qualify," says Solly Mapaila, SACP, First Deputy Secretary. "For instance he spoke about discipline I haven’t seen any discipline from him whether its revolutionary morality I haven’t see it whether its accountability I haven’t seen it. He failed to implement key decisions of the movement,” says Mapaila. eNCA

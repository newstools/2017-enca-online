JOHANNESBURG – The South African Airways (SAA) has denied reports that its food is not Halaal. On Friday the Daily Voice ran a story where three anonymous staff members, claim that non-Halaal meats and utensils were being used in the halaal kitchen. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali said in a statement: “South African Airways would like to assure all Muslim customers that the airline maintains the highest Halaal requirements and standards in food preparation.” The airline has since dismissed the story labelling it as sensational and baseless and went on to say this was an act by disgruntled workers.  READ: SAA worst-run SOE: Solidarity Research Institute “The claims made are baseless and malicious and appear to be the works of a handful of disgruntled employees who wish to bring the name of AirChefs and by extension, SAA into disrepute,” SAA said. “Nevertheless, the newspaper proceeded to publish a sensational report under a misleading and harmful headline, based on a mere say-so of its sources without attaching weight to the countervailing evidence to the claims made. The MJC is a highly respected body in the Muslim community and the story published casts aspersions on their independence and integrity,” added Tlali Tlali. eNCA

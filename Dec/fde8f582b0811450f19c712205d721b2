LONDON - Saracens finally ended their miserable losing streak as the European champions got back on track with a 29-17 win against Leicester in the English Premiership on Sunday. After suffering seven consecutive defeats, Saracens produced a commanding display at Welford Road to climb to second in the table behind leaders Exeter. "It was a confident display from us as we were good with or without the ball and our penalty count was very low," said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. "We did leave a couple of tries out there but we were in control and I didn't think the red card affected the result in any way." Jamie George crossed over for Saracens and England fly-half Owen Farrell kicked five penalties and a conversion. Jonny May's red card for two deliberate knock-ons was instrumental in Leicester's fifth consecutive defeat. Saracens also finished the game with 14 men after Mako Vunipola was sin-binned following a series of scrum penalties. But they held on for their first win since beating London Irish in late October. Mathew Tait crossed over for Leicester, with George Ford converting and also kicking a penalty. AFP

JOHANNESBURG – A preliminary squad of 54 athletes has been named by Athletics SA (ASA), as the nation’s top distance runners prepare to battle it out for places at two international cross country events to be held early next year. The squad members (27 men and 27 women in the senior and junior age divisions) have been invited to participate at the ASA Cross Country Trials at the University of Free State Grounds in Bloemfontein on January, 20. Teams will subsequently be selected for the CAA Southern Region Championships in Vacoas-Phoenix, Mauritius on March 3, and the fifth edition of CAA African Cross Country Championships in Chlef, Algeria, on March 17. “Cross country is the foundation of middle and long distance running, so aside from the steps we are taking to prepare a squad for international Cross Country championships over the next couple of seasons, this process also plays a part in our long-term plan to prepare road and track athletes for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” said ASA president Aleck Skhosana. “We have opened the door for a large provisional squad, in order to ensure we are providing opportunities to a wide pool of athletes at this early stage of the process. The squad will be refined as we approach upcoming major events. “Good luck to all athletes in the squad and we are confident the best of them will stand up and deliver when it counts in order to secure their positions in the final teams.”  African News Agency

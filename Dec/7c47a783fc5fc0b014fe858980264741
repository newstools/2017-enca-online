JOHANNESBURG - Controversial pastor, Paseka 'Mboro' Motsoeneng, is expected to appear in court in January on a charge of common assault. Earlier, police said he would be appearing in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court on Thursday after he was arrested for allegedly attacking a female paramedic with Ekurhuleni Emergency Services (EMS). The paramedic alleges she was assaulted at Mboro's Incredible Happenings Ministry on Sunday when emergency services were called out to attend to a sick child.  The pastor blamed inaction by paramedics for the three-year-old girl's death at his church.  But paramedics said the pastor and some of the congregants attacked them. The female emergency services worker was allegedly slapped by the pastor. EMS said she needed a surgical procedure for a wound on her right cheek.  At the same time. the mother of the three-year-old laid charges of culpable homicide against the paramedics who responded to the scene. Court officials said investigations are still underway and they want to put the two cases on the same docket. The case is expected to come before the court early in January.  eNCA

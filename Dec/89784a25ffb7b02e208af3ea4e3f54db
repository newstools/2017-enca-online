JOHANNESBURG - SA Communist Party (SACP)Â  general secretary Blade Nzimande is calling for introspection amid the challenges plaguing the tripartite alliance. He delivered a message of support to the ANC at its elective conference on Monday afternoon. "We must not deny the challenges that are facing us as a country and as a movement. We want to say as the SACP it is not automatic that after 20 years liberation movements falter," he said. "We must look at ourselves and say, 'Are we not making mistakes that will be used by our enemies to effect regime change agenda?'. That is very important that we do that. That is why in our own language we talk about the need for criticism and self-criticism," Nzimande said. eNCA

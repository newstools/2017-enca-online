JOHANNESBURG – The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has finally released the results of the Metsimaholo by-elections after major delays in the Free State. The ANC has won 16 seats, compared to the 19 it won in the 2016 Municipal Elections. The Democratic Alliance won 11 seats – that’s one less than last year. WATCH: ‘It’s too late for us, we failed,’ Zuma says The EFF retained its eight seats. And the SACP won three seats, after choosing to contest by-elections without its alliance partner.  The Metsimaholo by-elections have been marred by allegations of vote-rigging. eNCA

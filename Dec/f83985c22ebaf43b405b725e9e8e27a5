PRETORIA - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has addressed a group of Khoisan activists striking on the lawns of the Union Buildings. They had waited 23 days for this meeting after walking from the Eastern Cape and have been on a hunger strike for more than three weeks. One of the activists has been admitted to hospital. They had called on President Jacob Zuma or his deputy to meet them over issues of land and identity. The group also spent some time outside the Nasrec Expo Centre last week, hoping to meet ANC leaders. Ramaphosa promised the activists that he was taking their demands seriously and they would be given consideration by government. The Khoisan activists expressed their appreciation that Ramaphosa had broken from his pre-Christmas schedule to meet with them. They said they hoped they would now be able to be home for Christmas themselves. "This morning, I spoke to the Lord and I said I leave it all in your hands... My dreams have now come true," said one of the activists. The activists are expected to fly to Port Elizabeth on Sunday in order to get home in time to spend Christmas with their families. eNCA

Ramaphosa promised the activists that he was taking their demands seriously and they would be given consideration by government. #Khoisan4 @eNCA https://t.co/7MNKPQY5Lv The Khoisan activists expressed their appreciation that Ramaphosa had broken from his pre-Christmas schedule to meet with them. They said they hoped they would now be able to be home for Christmas themselves. "This morning, I spoke to the Lord and I said I leave it all in your hands... My dreams have now come true," said one of the activists. The activists are expected to fly to Port Elizabeth on Sunday in order to get home in time to spend Christmas with their families. eNCA

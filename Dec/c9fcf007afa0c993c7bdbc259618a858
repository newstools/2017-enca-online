JOHANNESBURG – South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande is recovering in hospital after 'consuming something' at the African National Congress' (ANC) elective conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg. SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo confirmed that Nzimande fell ill on Monday shortly after delivering his message of support at the ANC's elective conference. Mashilo, however, refused to say whether Nzimande's hospitalisation was because of food poisoning.

JOHANNESBURG - ANC Women's League president Bathabile Dlamini says Jessie Duarte would not be in the top six if she had been on Cyril Ramaphosa's slate. "We cannot be proud of this outcome. Patriarchy has once again reared its ugly head," she told a press briefing on Tuesday. "Jessie Duarte made it to the top six, we are proud of her but also we want to say comrade Jessie made it because she stood with another woman. If she had been standing with another male she would have gone under the bus. Oliver Tambo must be turning in his grave. The struggle to [get] a woman president was never going to be easy and we knew that from the word go," she said.

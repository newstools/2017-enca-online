JOHANNESBURG - The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a watch for the possibility of severe thunderstorms on Tuesday over Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northern KZN, and the eastern parts of North West. This means that atmospheric conditions are favourable for strong thunderstorms to develop. Thunderstorms within these areas could produce large hail and very strong winds and in rare cases tornadoes, as happened Monday afternoon.

JOHANNESBURG - ANC Women's League president Bathabile Dlamini says judges should refrain from trying to control the state. She was speaking at an ANC rally in Clermont, in KwaZulu-Natal, to mark the close of the party's year of Oliver Tambo. READ: 'Suspend Shaun Abrahams with immediate effect': DA "Judges make the South African government look like it is controlled by the judiciary. The government has three branches: the Cabinet, the legislature and the judiciary. And therefore we plead with judges to be neutral if they want us to respect them," said Dlamini. She took a swipe at the North Gauteng High Cort ruling that set aside the appointment of National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams and ordering Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint a new head within 60 days.  "Another thing, there was no justice in the judgment that was taken about the issue of the NPA," she said. eNCA

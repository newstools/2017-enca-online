JOHANNESBURG – News-making ANC member Carl Niehaus has labelled as a smear campaign media reports that he had told creditors he would receive an inheritance following his mother’s death. He said the aim of the smear was to influence the outcome of the ANC elective congress. Niehaus, spokesperson for the Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association and now associated with Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma’s presidential campaign, said the Sunday Times expose was an old and unsubstantiated story. Niehaus’s mother is still alive.

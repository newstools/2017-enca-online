CAPE TOWN – Seabelo Senatla was first the villain and then the hero as the South African Blitzboks scored in the dying seconds to beat Fiji 31-26 in the Cape Town Sevens Cup quarterfinals at the Cape Town Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Senatla first conceded a yellow card in the third minute due to a high tackle, which resulted in a penalty try for Fiji. Later he was bumped off by Josua Vakurunabili, who made it to the tryline as well. Another first-half try by Amenoni Nasilasila created the 16-point lead for the visitors, but after an early touchdown by Werner Kok, the Blitzboks scored again just before halftime when Justin Geduld finished off a thrilling move (21-12). Senatla made up for his earlier misdemeanours by scoring early in the second half to reduce the deficit to 21-17, but Kalione Nasoko put the foot down and raced away from the defence to extend Fiji’s lead once again. But that was the last time that they would put points on the board, as first Kwagga Smith and then Senatla rescued the situation for the Blitzboks to send them through to the Cup semi-finals. Scorers

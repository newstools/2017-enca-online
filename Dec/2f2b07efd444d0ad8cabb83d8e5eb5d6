JOHANNESBURG â€“ The African National Congress (ANC) on Sunday adopted credentials, starting the process of electing a new party president. The issue of credentials was contentious and even challenged in court, which led to significant delays at the Johannesburg gathering. Three courts on Friday ruled against branches believed to be in favour of presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma who faces stiff competition from Cyril Ramaphosa, who has an early edge, in what is believed to be a contest that is too close to call.  eNCA's Gareth Edwards unpacks the implications of the court rulings, as reflected in the new credentials, in the video above. eNCA

READ: Zuma will be a non-factor after December: Nzimande “We do, however, have some basic and principled expectations of the conference. In wishing the delegates to the conference well, we’re urging them to elect a leadership collective that will move the ANC out of its leadership paralysis. The alliance and the country require a leadership collective that is finally prepared to lead decisively not just in words, but in action”. Nzimande also said the SACP wants parliament to institute a full-scale inquiry into alleged influence over government policy by Multichoice. The party also wants allegedly suspicious payments MultiChoice made to news channel ANN7 to be investigated.

In which a private monopoly was gifted valuable public archive. Monopoly capital cannot be allowed to corruptly buy government policies and public assets. The revelations of SABC board’s meetings with multichoice have reinforced our call for this inquiry. It is unacceptable for Naspers and multichoice to carry out an investigation into themselves”. The party added that the proposed water and electricity tariff hikes are beyond justifiable levels and are without policy guidance. eNCA

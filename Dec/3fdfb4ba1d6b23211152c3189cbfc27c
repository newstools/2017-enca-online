JOHANNESBURG - An inter-departmental task team established last year is drafting regulations in terms of the State of Emergency Act of 1997. According to newspaper Rapport, the national defence force held a workshop on the issue in October and more details have now emerged.
	
	The newspaper claims a draft has been sent to the South African National Defence Force for input. It has reportedly endorsed the regulations. The proposed regulations gives security officers the authority to cut all communication channels, including Internet access, should the president declare a state of emergency. They will also be able to detain or arrest any person. The proposed powers include search and seizure without a warrant. Lawyers for Human Rights is quoted as saying the regulations are vague and give wide powers to security officials. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has admitted that normal programming was disrupted on at least three of its radio stations on Thursday as a result of the ongoing workers’ strike. SABC employees affiliated to the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers Union (Bemawu) and Communications Workers Union (CWU) resumed their strike action over salary increases on Thursday after negotiations with the public broadcaster reached a deadlock. They are demanding a 10 percent salary increment backdated to April, while the cash-strapped broadcaster says it can afford to increase their salaries by only 4.5 percent.  READ: SABC workers strike for higher pay In a statement, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said that programming on radio and television had been minimally affected and was running as scheduled. There were reports that SABC’s current affairs shows and news bulletins did not air on Thursday. “Programming on television has gone ahead as planned with no interruptions. Out of the 19 SABC radio stations, only three were affected, namely Thobela FM, Munghana Lonene FM and Ikwekwezi FM. Their respective current affairs shows did not go on air as a result of presenters pulling out of the shows at the last minute,” Kganyago said. The SABC had received reports of intimidation of employees entering the work premises and blocking entry points, he said. “Management views this matter in a serious light and will be engaging with the SABC’s protection services, the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Joint Planning Committee to attend to this matter urgently, to ensure the safety of all employees who are not participating in the strike,” Kganyago said.

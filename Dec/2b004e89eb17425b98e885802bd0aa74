JOHANNESBURG - Supporters of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma hold a rally at Sugar Ray Xulu stadium in Clermont, Durban on Saturday. Among those expected to attend are Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe, ANC presidential contender Zweli Mkhize, North West premier Supra Mahumapelo and Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza. Dlamini-Zuma has been nominated to become party president by the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and North West. INTERACT: MAP: Different issues across ANC provinces In Mpumalanga, the results of the ANC's provincial general council surprised many, with almost half of the branches voting for neither Nkosazana-Dlamini nor the other frontrunner, Cyril Ramaphosa, but for "unity", apparently on instructions from Mabuza. Given the large number of delegates Mpumalanga will have at the elective conference, Mabuza is being seen as something of a kingmaker.  He is also far ahead in branch nominations for deputy president of the party. Earlier this week, another presidential hopeful, Mathews Phosa, accused Mabuza of using a "private army" to scare ANC members. This was refuted by the Mpumalanga ANC. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The Royal House of Mandela has wished South Africans a happy new year as it welcomes the Nelson Mandela centennial celebrations in 2018. In a brief statement reflecting on the year that was, Chief Mandla Mandela spared no blushes for certain individuals and organisations.  “It sometimes felt that certain parliamentarians were frivolously trying to set a Guinness Book of Records for the most votes of no confidence in a year in 2017,” Mandela said of opposition parties, and in particular the Democratic Alliance (DA) proposing a number of motions against President Zuma. “2017 was a big year for publishers and power pedlars who collectively revealed…. raw ambitions of those who would stop at nothing for self-aggrandisement,” reads the statement. The Chief also touched upon scholars who were writing matric exams this year as well, as on issues of the international community.

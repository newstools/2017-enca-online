JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congess (ANC's) national leadership is meeting behind closed doors in Irene near Pretoria. This is the last time the ANC's top leadership is scheduled to meet before the National Elective Conference. The party's National Executive Committee is likely putting the finishing touches on preparations ahead of this all-important meeting in less than 2 weeks. But the task of dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s comes amidst numerous court challenges. Indications are that despite disgruntled members crying foul over the electoral nomination process, the conference will go ahead. READ: INFOGRAPHIC: How does voting work at the ANC conference?

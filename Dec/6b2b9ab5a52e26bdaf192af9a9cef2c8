JOHANNESBURG – An unprecedented 10 million passengers are expected to fly through Cape Town International Airport this festive season, officials said on Friday. “Today [Friday, 15 December] is set to be the single busiest day of the month with four to six January expected to be the peak time at the beginning of 2018,” Senior Corporate Affairs Manager Deidre Davids said. She urged passengers to get to the airport earlier than they might normally do. Davids said this would ensure flights were not delayed and that there was enough time to deal with any problems. “Getting here early also reduces some of the stress that especially families can experience in the middle of holiday crowds.” READ: Dubai-bound man caught with over R10m at Cape Town airport She further urged users and passengers to immediately report suspicious activity and suspicious looking individuals, packages or unattended bags to police, airport security or staff. A number of arrests were made at the airport this year with people even being rounded up for making bomb threats. “We hope that passengers appreciate that there is never going to be a humorous way to talk about security. We take a hardline and any unwise remark can lead to you being arrested and your holiday disrupted.” eNCA

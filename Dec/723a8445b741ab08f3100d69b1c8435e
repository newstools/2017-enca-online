WELLINGTON - Black Caps all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme will miss the upcoming one-day international series against the West Indies after the sudden death of his father, New Zealand Cricket said Thursday. Zimbabwe-born de Grandhomme was travelling to Harare to be with his family and will be replaced in the squad by Doug Bracewell.

"Right now the most important thing is that Colin is with his family." New Zealand Cricket said it did not know when de Grandhomme would return. The 31-year-old moved to New Zealand in 2006, making his ODI debut in 2012 and breaking into the Test team last year.

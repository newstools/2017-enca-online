TRIPOLI - The mayor of Libya's third-largest city, Misrata, has been killed by unidentified assailants who abducted him as he returned from an official trip overseas, a security source said on Monday. Mohamad Eshtewi's body was found dumped in the street after he was kidnapped after leaving the airport in the western coastal city late Sunday, the source said. The city hospital said it had received the mayor's body bearing gunshot wounds.

Eshtewi was returning from an official visit to Turkey with other members of the city council, who were all elected in 2014 for four years. UN envoy for Libya Ghassan Salame on Twitter denounced the killing and expressed his "profound sadness" over the news. Britain's ambassador to Libya, Peter Millett, said he was "deeply saddened by (the) senseless murder". "He worked hard to serve his people," he said on Twitter. Home to some 400,000 people, Misrata is considered one of Libya's safest cities. Its powerful militias played a major role in expelling the Islamic State group from the coastal city of Sirte last year.

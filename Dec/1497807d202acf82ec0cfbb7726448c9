CAPE TOWN – The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the Western Cape on Monday condemned Metrorail for suspending services on the central line. The rail operator blamed the decision on vandalism, cable theft and the destruction of infrastructure. Metrorail is advising Cape Town commuters to make use of alternative transport. Cosatu Western Cape chairperson Motlatsi Tsubane said: “The commuters were not aware, they only found out this morning that there were no trains for them as they’ve been suspended indefinitely. “It’s indigenous of Prasa to always shift the blame to vandalism. Vandalism is there but if they had enough security and their infrastructure was secured, we don’t think this would happen. We want them to come up with tangible plans in order to address the challenge we are faced with.” Golden Arrow has offered to help Metrorail commuters get to their destinations. eNCA

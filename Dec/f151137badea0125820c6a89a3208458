JOHANNESBURG – A legal storm is in full swing within the North West's African National Congress (ANC). Some members want to stop its regional elective conference and Provincial General Council meetings from going ahead as the party is still nominating its preferred candidate for party president. The party’s provincial spokesperson Gerald Modise said the matter is still before the court but stressed the PEC’s is going to win the case. “We have all the responses the application is raising in relation to that particular matter in relation to the previous BGM that were held before the national conference on the process itself but we are confident that we will win,” he said.  WATCH: ANC's second-biggest province heads to PGC “So far so good we are confident it won't have an impact on our existence as the PEC and in the running of the organisational matters in the province.” He has since urged all those who are disputing the process to engage with them on numerous occasions. “We have written letters but we are still appealing to them to address the leadership of the province so that we can address their disputed issues once and for all." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - US singer Solange Knowles has pulled out of the Afropunk music festival in Johannesburg with a nerve disorder. Their disappointment didn’t stop AfroPunk attendees from wishing her a speedy recovery.  Solange may be in their hearts but people have come up with artists they would like to replace her ... if logistics and money weren't an issue. The names suggested included platinum-selling producer and musician Frank Ocean, TDE’s songstress SZA, androgynous being Janelle Monae and newcomer Kelela. eNCA.com staff's top 5 suggestions are: 1.Oshun 2.

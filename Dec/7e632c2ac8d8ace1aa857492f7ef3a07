JOHANNESBURG – Criminals are more likely to target stokvel members as the festive season approaches as they know that they are being paid out for the holidays, that is according to the South African Banking Risk Information Centre. Sabric says between 2014 and 15 December 2017, 53 stokvel robbery incidents were reported, with 77-percent of incidents occurring during the festive season. The organisation says criminals also know that people are winding down during this period and may not be as careful when carrying large amounts of cash. READ: Stokvel Indaba unpacks R44-billion industry Sabric CEO Kalyani Pillay has urged bank clients to be vigilant and pay attention to their surroundings at this time of year. “It is very distressing that bank clients, who are the victims of stokvel robberies are often injured or even killed during these incidents, which is why we urge them to find safer ways to transact, such as internet transfers or mobile banking, instead of carrying large amounts of cash,” said Kalyani. Here are tips for stokvel groupings to ensure that they can protect themselves and their cash. • Refrain from making cash deposits of club members’ contributions on high-risk days (e.g. Monday after month end). • Ensure persons depositing club cash contributions or making withdrawals are accompanied by another club member. • A stokvel savings club or burial society can arrange for members to deposit cash directly into the club’s account instead of collecting cash contributions. • Arrange for the club’s pay out to be electronically transferred into each club member’s personal account or accounts of their choice. • Take another person with when going to deposit club cash contributions.

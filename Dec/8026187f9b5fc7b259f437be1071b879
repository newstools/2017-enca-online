JOHANNESBURG – South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) staff will go on strike on Thursday, exactly a day before the beginning of the ANC’s National Elective Conference. They're rejecting the public broadcaster's latest offer of a 4,5 percent wage increase. "In that 4.5 percent, they are saying they want to backdate it because it should have been paid since April, but they're only prepared to pay for six months with the first instalment coming in February and the second in March,” Communication Workers’ Union (CWU’s) Aubrey Tshabalala said. READ: Strike looming at SABC “The last four months will be paid in September 2018, meaning that there will be no increase next year and once we give up now as workers, we will be plunging ourselves deeper into a crisis as all commodities increase, including medical aid, and here they are offering zero percent.” eNCA

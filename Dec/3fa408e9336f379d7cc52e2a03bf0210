DUBAI – The Springbok Sevens team opened their defence of the Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens on a positive note, finishing top of pool A on Day One of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series opener. The Blitzboks beat Uganda 19-10, Kenya 48-5 and Canada 28-0 in a performance that picked up intensity as the side found momentum as the day progressed. They face Samoa at 09h00 (SA time) in the Cup quarterfinals on Saturday. Springbok Sevens coach, Neil Powell, had mixed emotions following the clean sweep, but admitted that it was job done. “We were sloppy against Uganda in the opener, then played much better against Kenya and conceded no points against Canada in the final pool match. We improved as we progressed, but overall it was a day with mixed emotions,” Powell indicated.

It was not easy out there, but we kept on improving and I cannot ask for much more.” The team knows very well that Day Two will determine the success of their efforts in Dubai, said Powell. “We need to step up. Samoa showed they are a team progressing all the time and we have to pitch up with our best effort. If not, we will not be defending our title,” Powell said. The average score between the sides are 18-14 and the Blitzboks won 43 of 69 matches played. Meanwhile, the SA Rugby Sevens Academy also started their campaign in the Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens International Invitational tournament on a winning note. They beat Monaco Impi 42-0, Canada Maple Leafs 33-5 and Samurai 31-7 in pool play. African News Agency

KWAMHLANGA – Pan Africanist Congress of Azania secretary general Narius Moloto has been elected as the party’s new president at its two-day national policy conference near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga this weekend. PAC senior official Jones Tholo was elected deputy president. Addressing the conference attended by about 3000 delegates, Moloto said the PAC leadership had managed to clean the organisation and rid it of “dirty things”. It was now up to every PAC member to work hard for the party in preparation for the 2019 general elections. READ: The key to economic freedom is in the land: PAC “We have a responsibility to take the party to the 2019 general elections. We believe the PAC will make huge strides in the 2019 general elections. We must continue to recruit members and defend the PAC. The PAC must have a big influence in this country. The PAC’s influence must also be felt in Africa and internationally. We will continue to serve our people,” he said. The PAC was now different to what it was five years ago. The leadership had managed to instill discipline within the organisation and among its members. “We have re-committed ourselves to go and re-build the PAC. The PAC is a liberation movement and it will remain true to the liberation of our country,” Moloto said. Moloto has filled the presidential position that became vacant earlier this year when the PAC disciplinary committee expelled former president Luthando Mbinda. However, despite his expulsion, Mbinda still occupies the PAC’s only seat in the National Assembly. Speaking to reporters after the conference, Moloto said the PAC would soon initiate civil court proceedings to have Mbinda vacate the seat, but insisted that he himself would not become the PAC’s sole MP. The PAC was founded in 1959 by the late Robert Sobukwe and others after a split in the African National Congress.

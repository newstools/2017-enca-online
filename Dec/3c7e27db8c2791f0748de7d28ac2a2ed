MEXICO CITY - Rappers treated 11,000 roaring fans to verbal sparring at a famous fighting venue at the weekend. The playful insults were flowing at the Red Bull Batalla de los Gallos World Final as the best Spanish-speaking freestyle rappers went toe-to-toe. The event is an MC competition that since 2005 has given a stage to the best Spanish-speaking hip-hop freestylers. In the capital’s Arena México, a venue famous for hosting the boxing at the 1968 Summer Games and more recently wrestling bouts, rappers from 11 different countries unleashed a torrent of abuse at each other to the roaring approval of the sold-out crowd.

Aczino knocked out Spanish rival Arkano in the semi-finals before defeating Wos from Argentina in an epic final battle in which he rhymed and rapped around 160 insulting words per minute, around two-and-a-half words per second. To put this into context, when in standard conversation it is thought most humans speak at an average pace of between 110-130 words per minute while the world record in a song was set in 2013 by Eminem who rapped at just over four words per second in his hit ‘Rap God’.

Countries represented in the final were Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Spain, Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic and Venezuela. Reuters

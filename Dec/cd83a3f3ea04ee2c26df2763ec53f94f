JOHANNESBURG - Cabinet has approved a new board for controversy-riddled Eskom. The board comprises current interim chairperson Zethembe Khoza and interim members Pat Naidoo, Giovanni Leonardi, Pulane Molokwane, Simphiwe Dingaan, Banothile Makhubela, Sathiaseelan Gounden, plus two new members, Malegapuru Makgoba and Tshepo Mongalo.  Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown would instruct the board to prioritise the appointment of a new group chief executive, a statement from her ministry said on Friday. Matshela Koko was suspended as CEO in August, after Brian Molefe was in and out of the position. Eskom, which is at the centre of an ongoing parliamentary inquiry, has come under intense public scrutiny over the past few months amid allegations that executives and board members allegedly favoured the Gupta family when dishing out multimillion-rand contracts.

Makgoba is the Health Ombud of South Africa and deputy chairman of the National Planning Commission. Mongalo is an academic and legal practitioner, with expertise in company law.

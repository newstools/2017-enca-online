CAPE TOWN -Cape Town Stadium is to be renamed in an effort to improve its finances. The venue, which seats about 60,000 people, is looking to team up with a brand that will manage the stadium in a commercially viable way. According to Stuart Diamond of the City of Cape Town, the city wants to unlock revenue streams and make the stadium more profitable by linking a sponsor's name to the stadium's.  READ: Cape Town's 'day zero' brought forward by a month The stadium generated just over R14 million in revenue in the last financial year by hosting more than 100 events, from sports games, to concerts, and some film shoots, he said. "The FNB Stadium is getting R15-million a year, and we feel that we have a package with HSB Sevens, the PSK football and big concert events.” Diamond insists the winning sponsor must fit in with the ethos and brand of the city. The bidding process is open until mid-January. eNCA

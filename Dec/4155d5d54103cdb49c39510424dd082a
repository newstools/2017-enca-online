JOHANNESBURG - Unions at the SABC say a tactical strike is underway at the public broadcaster. Not all workers have downed tools, but programming has been affected.  The union said the timing of the strike was not specifically planned to coincide with the ANC's elective conference. Bemawu President Hannes du Buisson said, "Middle management has indicated - we had meetings with them yesterday and we had meetings with a number of freelancers - support for a strike.  They are of course two groups... who have been grossly neglected by the SABC.  READ: Multichoice paid SABC R100-million: DA "Freelancers have been abused over many years so they all are in support of a strike. SABC has not moved yet.  "We sincerely hope that they will move and that this matter be resolved before the conference is broadcast.  But it is not only the conference that is going to suffer, there's news in general that is currently not going out on certain radio stations ...we believe when we step up the heat of the strike that other services will also be affected." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The Tuks Rugby Sevens women’s team once again made their presence felt in international competitions by finishing third in the Emirates Dubai Invitation Tournament at the weekend. The Tuks team lost 17-15 in the semifinals against the Irish Women’s Development Team and it’s only the second game the Tuks team have lost since July, the other being the final they played in Rome. But Tuks can still boast of having beaten the champions, Randwick Magic from Australia, in their pool games. In the playoffs for the third place Tuks beat The Royals 17-15. Randwick Magic won the final by beating the Irish Development team 15-10. The national teams of Russia, Belgium, Poland and Wales also competed in the competition. #Dubai7s Match 33 : IIW : BF1

Libbie Janse van Rensburg (Tuks captain) ascribed the team’s third place to pure passion. “We play for each other. The real motivation is to make Tuks proud. There are no words to describe how it feels to win internationally playing in the coveted jersey. It is special.” According to Janse van Rensburg, the quarterfinal game against Belgium was a humdinger. “We had a score to settle with Belgium after drawing against them during a tournament in France earlier the season. “A little bit of over-eagerness led to two of our players being sin-binned which meant that for about two minutes it was a case of five against seven players. Luckily we managed to stay focused and secure the win.” In the semifinal, a Tuks player received a yellow card for a foul. That meant that in the dying minutes the team was again one player short. The Irish made the most of it and scored the winning try. The Tuks team’s next international tournament is at the end of January in Fiji. African News Agency

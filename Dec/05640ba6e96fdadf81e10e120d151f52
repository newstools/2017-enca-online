MADRID - Croatian Mateo Kovacic was the surprise selection in Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid starting line-up for El Clasico against Barcelona on Saturday as the Frenchman left Gareth Bale and Isco on the bench. Kovacic hasn't started a La Liga game this season, but did a sterling job man-marking Barca's danger man Lionel Messi as Real thrashed the Catalans 5-1 on aggregate in the Spanish Super Cup back in August.

Bale is also kept in reserve, with the Welshman easing himself back to fitness after nearly three months on the sidelines. You look at Madrid's XI and then think they can bring on Isco, Bale and Asensio. Lol. That squad is ridiculous. Barca haven't been beaten since they last visited the Santiago Bernabeu in the Super Cup and hold a commanding 11-point lead over Real in the title race, although Madrid do have a game in hand. There were no surprises in Ernesto Valverde's line-up as Thomas Vermaelen continues to deputise for the injured Samuel Umtiti alongside Gerard Pique at the heart of a Barca defence that has conceded just eight goals in their 24-game unbeaten run. Messi is joined by Luis Suarez in attack, with Brazilian international Paulinho supporting from midfield. AFP

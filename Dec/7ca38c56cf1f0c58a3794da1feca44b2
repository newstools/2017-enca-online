"As far as we are concerned scores of delegates, including dignitaries, international guests, and foreign media will flock to Gauteng this week ahead of the ANC’s 54th National Conference. The Conference will bring some economic spin-offs, especially for the hospitality sector. Liquor trading hours will not be extended, even though by law we have the discretion to do so”, says MEC Lebogang Maile. Maile warned: “Any outlet that will sell liquor illegally during the duration of the Conference will face the wrath of the law. Our Inspectors will be on the look-out working closely with law enforcement agencies, especially the police. We will be conducting impromptu raids to monitor all outlets." According to the statement, Maile would like to encourage delegates, especially foreign guests, to take advantage of their stay in the province and to visit the province’s many heritage sites as well as township tourism hot-spots. eNCA

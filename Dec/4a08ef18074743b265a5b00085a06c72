The foundation says it has reached over 300 000 young people living with HIV/AIDS through the programs it supports. “It was devastating to grow up watching this epidemic destroy my home country,” says Theron. “The good news is that today we have the opportunity to see the end of AIDS in our lifetime, but it’s going to take all of us. We all need to look honestly at the stigma and societal inequality that still exist and that continue to prevent us from stopping the spread of the virus. “The leadership of young people is going to be critical at tackling these difficult issues. They will lead today’s fight against HIV, and we have to do what we can to support them. Individuals, non-profits, governments, researchers, and community members must all help invest in this young generation.” eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The US founder of the #AfroPunk music and style festival, Matthew Morgan, says Johannesburg will eventually become the biggest of the events. "Following up on the news from last night that Solange would no longer be playing AFROPUNK, we want to continue the dialogue with you," said Morgan.  "We know that we are new here and as we have made a significant investment in order to be here, we know that you have made an investment in us as well.  "Thank you for the overwhelming, positive support you’ve shown us so far.  We truly apologise for the last minute change," he said.

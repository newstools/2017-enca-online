JOHANNESBURG - Former ANC Women’s League President, Angie Motshekga says she has great respect for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, but she’s not backing her for party president. The Basic Education Minister wants Cyril Ramaphosa to lead the ANC after its December conference. This differs with the official nomination of the party’s Women’s League.

Motshekga was speaking at a 16 days of activism campaign against gender-based violence. “I am really praying with all my heart that we get the best team out. I have my own preference, but that doesn’t mean I have anything against the other contestants. I have lots of respect for Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. I think she is amongst the best women the ANC has produced. So I really hope that the team that emerges will be the best in the ANC. Obviously led by my preferred candidate, Cyril, but also inclusive of the other good people in the ANC, and there is a lot of them," said Motshega.  Motshekga denies the ANC’s Women’s League’s accusation that she’s trying to rule from the grave. She says the league's statement is petty. “It was just a very unfortunate statement so I said to them I just find it so silly, cheap and petty...I don’t need a platform to say what I think. It is my right to say what I think. The ANC constitution allows me" eNCA

"Yaya @YayaToure has decided to return to Ivory Coast national team. He wants to win another trophy with the Elephants of Ivory Coast," Seluk tweeted. Toure, who has won over 100 caps, was part of the Ivory Coast side which won the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. U-turn

But Seluk's tweet suggests he has no imminent thoughts of retiring from football, given Ivory Coast failed to qualify for next year's World Cup, meaning their next opportunity for silverware will be the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.

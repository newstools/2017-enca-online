JOHANNESBURG - The SACP is condemning President Jacob’s Zuma’s decision to appeal the state capture judgment. “All alliance partners, inclusive of the ANC ... and a wide range of other deeply concerned South Africans welcomed the judgment and called on President Zuma to comply,” the SACP said in a statement on Saturday. “The appeal will prove to be a waste of taxpayers’ money and a further delaying tactic, particularly should it be dismissed." READ: Zuma the worst leader ANC has ever had: SACP The DA, EFF and Fedusa have also condemned Zuma's decision. Two weeks ago, the North Gauteng High Court rejected Zuma's application to review the public protector's remedial action on the state capture. It ordered him to appoint a commission of inquiry with a judge selected by the chief justice, as prescribed by former public protector Thuli Madonsela. The court also ordered him to personally pay the costs of that court application. The SACP said its support of an inquiry was a matter of principle. "South Africa needs to root out corruption in all its manifestations if it is to become a prosperous society underpinned by a fully developed democracy without the exploitation of public resources, national wealth and one person by another," its statement reads. . eNCA

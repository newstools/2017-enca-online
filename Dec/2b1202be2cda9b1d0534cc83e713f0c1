JOHANNESBURG – Social media has criticised Rhodes University for expelling two student activists for life on “conduct beyond lawful boundaries.” The charges by the institution stem from a protest against rape culture at the university a year ago. According to Rhodes University, the two led a mob that dragged four students suspected of sexual offences. It charged them with kidnapping, assault, defamation and insubordination, before handing down a life ban.

Stories of rape appeared under #Rhodeswar, with students revealing their frustrations at how the university is dealing with the issue too slowly. The university lambasted the hashtag, saying it was as a “gross misrepresentation of facts and cynical attempts at manipulating public opinion by some of the students who have been excluded from the university for committing criminal acts.” The university is standing by its decision, saying the sanctions were consistent with three court rulings, one in the high court, another in the Supreme Court of Appeal as well as in the Constitutional Court. eNCA

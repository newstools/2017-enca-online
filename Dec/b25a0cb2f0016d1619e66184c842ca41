JOHANNESBURG - An Economist magazine poll has voted South Africa's national anthem as the world's favourite. Russia's anthem came in second with Uruguay’s rounding up the top three. Poll organisers were looking for anthems that stand out, and for them, South Africa’s "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika"‚ "creates its own world entirely." It was penned by Uitenhage-born composer, Enoch Sontonga, in the 1890s, as a religious song. The ANC used it as a rallying cry in the fight against oppression. Translated to mean "God Bless Africa" in isiXhosa, five African countries have previously used it as a national anthem. At the dawn of democracy, it was combined with the apartheid era's "Die Stem" to form a new one. It is now sung in five languages and was adopted in 1997. eNCA

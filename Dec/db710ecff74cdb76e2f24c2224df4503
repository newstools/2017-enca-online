CAIRO - Egypt's Coptic Church head Pope Tawadros II has cancelled a meeting scheduled for later this month with US Vice-President Mike Pence in Cairo in protest at Washington's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the church said on Saturday. US President Donald Trump's decision "did not take into account the feelings of millions of Arab people," the church said in a statement, adding it decided not to receive Pence when his visits Egypt.

JOHANNESBURG – While many people are eagerly awaiting to see the back of 2017 and while this year has been bad for many, it’s been very good to South Africa’s currency the rand. The local unit opened the year at R16,67 to the dollar and closed at R12,36, 1,17 percent higher on the year. It was another year of ups and downs for the rand, which plummeted sharply after the firing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, with the unit only fully recovering from that only a few days ago. READ: Rand within 3c of pre-Gordhan firing level December provided the currency with things to cheer about, spurred largely by the election win of Cyril Ramaphosa to the position of ANC president and subsequently, the ConCourt ruling on President Jacob Zuma’s impeachment (provided it stays the same – the positive trend currently). In 2016, the rand gained 10,9 percent, going from R15,56 on 1 January to R13,67 at the end of December. The currency in 2015 suffered huge losses, especially towards the end of the year due to Nenegate – the sacking of the then finance minister. The rand that year opened at R11,57 and closed at R15,29 to the dollar. eNCA

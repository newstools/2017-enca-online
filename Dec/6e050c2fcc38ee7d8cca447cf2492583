JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress will be electing a new party leader in December at Nasrec, Johannesburg.  The party meets in this way every 5 years, and the previous conference (in 2012) was held in Mangaung in the Free State.  While it is not yet known who will emerge victorious in December, one thing is certain - it won't be Jacob Zuma.  The incumbent ruling-party leader has said he will not be standing for re-election.    (Graphics: Roxanne Joseph and Douglas Simoes) eNCA

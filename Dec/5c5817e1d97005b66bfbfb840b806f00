ROME - "O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree, how pitifully bare are your branches!" Romans on Tuesday were mourning the untimely death of the Eternal City's tree, affectionately nicknamed 'Baldy'. With a week still to go until 25 December, the tree in the Italian capital's main square of Piazza Venezia has become such a laughing stock that it led the mayor to launch an investigation into what prompted Baldy's premature demise. "Rome's tree is dry, dead on arrival. It's a metaphor for the state of the capital," one local wrote on Twitter, while another wondered: "What time does the funeral start?" The symbol of an endless Rome decadence. “SPELACCHIO”, the frail and shabby Christmas Tree of the Eternal City recently set in Piazza Venezia, has sadly died just after a couple of weeks. #italy pic.twitter.com/DtXiaEoMT4 According to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero, a preliminary inquiry found that the tree was not properly covered during transport from the Dolomites in northern Italy, where it had been grown. A wide range of Romans -- including environmentalists and professional gardeners -- have opined that a tree of a more robust variety also would have survived for longer before starting to shed. Poor Baldy is a Norway spruce, while the European silver fir would have been a much safer bet for a tree, these self-professed Christmas tree experts said. Many have compared "the fir tree agony" -- which has cost the city some 48,000 euros (R723,000) -- to the governing Five Star Movement (M5S), which won the mayorship in 2016 but has struggled with a transport and rubbish crisis. "As if the mess they have created over the past year-and-a-half was not enough, we must put up with this misery," tweeted another Roman. Il Messaggero declared it a national embarrassment, saying that "in Russia, they've dubbed our dying tree a 'toilet brush'."

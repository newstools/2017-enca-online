JOHANNESBURG – Moody’s said on Thursday it had downgraded the credit rating of retail holding group Steinhoff by four notches to B1 from Baa3 and put it under review for further downgrade over accounting irregularities. “The downgrade of Steinhoff’s ratings and review for further downgrade reflect the uncertainties and implications for the company’s liquidity and debt capital structure arising from an announcement … that new information has come to light which relates to accounting irregularities,” Moody’s said.

On Thursday the firm said it had received expressions of interest in non-core assets which would release a minimum of €1 billion of liquidity. Its subsidiary Steinhoff Africa Retail Limited would also commit to refinancing its long-term liabilities due to the company, adding further liquidity of about €2 billion. South Africa’s Public Servants Association (PSA), which represents more than 230,000 members of the Government Employees’ Pension Fund, said it was investigating suggestions that the fund may have lost about R12.5 billion through investments in Steinhoff. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Thursday he supported a decision by the Financial Services Board to institute an independent investigation into
	possible false and misleading reports, in addition to an internal investigation by securities exchange JSE of accounting irregularities at Steinhoff. African News Agency

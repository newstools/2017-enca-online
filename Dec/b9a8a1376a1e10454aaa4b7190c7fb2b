JOHANNESBURG - The ANC's Angie Motshekga will deliver her keynote address to mark 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children. She will make the speech in Orange Farm in southern Gauteng on Sunday morning. I have been told that Angie Motshekga, who will give the keynote address at the event in Orange Farm, needs to get to an #ANC NEC meeting so will be speaking first & then leaving. #ANCWL Violence against women and children has been a big issue in South Africa over the past few years.

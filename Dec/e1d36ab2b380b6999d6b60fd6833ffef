LOS ANGELES - Rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs was ranked the world's highest-paid musician on the annual Forbes list whose top four spots were occupied by black artists. Combs, who is also a hip-hop producer and entrepreneur, earned an estimated $130-million (about R1.8-million) for the year, according to Forbes, mostly from his Bad Boy Family Reunion tour and the sale of his Sean Jean clothing line. Beyonce ranked second, with earnings estimated at $105-million from her Formation world tour and hit album "Lemonade", while Canadian artists Drake ($94-million) and The Weeknd ($92-million) rounded out the top four.

Forbes compiled the list after estimating pre-tax income for the 12 months from June 2016 based on interviews with managers, agents, lawyers, interviews and data from Pollstar, the Recording Industry Association of America and tracking firm Nielsen. Last year's top two artists, Taylor Swift, and British boy band One Direction, both slipped out of the top 10 this year. Swift did not tour this year and released her latest album in November, while One Direction are on hiatus as members pursue solo careers.

Traffic authorities established roadblocks across the province, with 10 arrests for drunk driving from the over 400 cars stopped. “We have been informed that about 2,000 vehicles are passing every hour here, so that means we are experiencing an increase in a number of visitors to our province. It is for this reason that as the department, we have developed a safety season plan which focuses on increasing the number of police on our roads,” KwaZulu-Natal Transport Department’s Mluleki Mntungwa said.

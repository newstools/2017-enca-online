JOHANNESBURG - Emperors Palace is hosting the 10th annual Garden of Lights,  a magical fair that guarantees to light up the Gauteng festive season.  The Garden of Lights, under way in the perfectly manicured gardens of the five-star Peermont D’oreale Grande hotel at Emperors Palace. features spectacular light displays, colourful characters, fun-fair rides and delicious food.  “Over the years the Garden of Lights has welcomed more than 1.3 million visitors, and promises to welcome countless more with the fantastic family-friendly activities we have planned for this year,” says Clive Tavener, general manager for Emperors Palace.  “The Garden of Lights is our way of bringing back the days when mom and dad would bundle the whole family into the car to go and see the Christmas lights in town.” Visitors to the Garden of Lights, which runs until 3 January,  will be delighted to know that proceeds from the R25 entrance fee will be donated to the Cancer Association of South Africa, and the Peermont Children's and Education Trusts.  “With so many families affected by cancer in one way or another, it is vital to raise awareness and we are proud to be associated with this heart-warming cause.  Similarly, many South Africans are unable to afford education for their children, and by donating proceeds to children in disadvantaged areas of the Ekurhuleni everyone plays a part in creating a brighter future for those less fortunate”, Tavener concludes. Not only will families be mesmerised by the spectacular lights display, children will also have an opportunity to take pictures with Mrs Claus, the Magical Fairy and Frosty the Snowman. After strolling through the garden, visitors can grab a refreshing drink and bite to eat at one of the food and beverage stalls. The Garden of Lights' fun-fair rides include Jump and Smile, Break Dancer, Freeway Fantasy, Helter Skelter and the all-time favourite, the big Ferris Wheel (located at the garden entrance). eNCA

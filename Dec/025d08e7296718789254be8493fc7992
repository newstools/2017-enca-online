JOHANNESBURG - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has submitted an affidavit to the Constitutional Court explaining why she should not personally incur the costs of the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) court case. READ: Dlamini faces Sassa music in Parliament Dlamini says top officials at the social security agency were aware of what she was doing at all times. The minister says she did what she thought was necessary to ensure the continued payment of social grants. Dlamini refutes the accounts of former Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza and former Social Development director-general Zane Dangor. In their affidavits, they said they considered Dlamini's work streams to be unnecessary as they overlapped with the work already being done by Sassa. eNCA

LONDON - Southampton striker Charlie Austin has been hit with a violent conduct charge after he kicked Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl in the face. Lossl was left with a bloodied face and a suspected broken nose following the incident in Saturday's 1-1 draw at St Mary's. Austin avoided punishment for the incident at the time, but could now face a retrospective ban from the Football Association. He was given until 1700 GMT on Sunday to respond to the charge. In-form Austin netted Southampton's opener midway through the first half against Huddersfield, but came off with a hamstring injury after the interval. Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino confirmed Austin is likely to be sidelined for the remainder of the Christmas fixtures.

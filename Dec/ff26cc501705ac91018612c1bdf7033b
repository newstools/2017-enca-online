JOHANNESBURG – Only months after Dudu Myeni was removed as South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson following a string of scandals, she has landed a top job as adviser to Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi, the Sunday Times reported. The controversial appointment — which could see Myeni net more than R1 million a year — came as government considered moving SAA from National Treasury to the transport department, the newspaper said. IN TWEETS: Zuma ally Dudu Myeni replaced Maswanganyi confirmed there was a national review underway to move SAA to his department. He also defended the appointment of Myeni, who is a friend of President Jacob Zuma, saying she had been “highly recommended”, but would not say by who. “I needed someone with aviation experience… I appointed her as one of my advisers because as a minister I am allowed to appoint a maximum of three advisers without advertising the posts,” the Sunday Times reported Maswanganyi as having said. The Presidency is dismissing reports that government has decided to move SAA to the transport department. It says the national carrier remains located in national Treasury while a review is underway. The Presidency says the cash-strapped airline is continuing to receive Treasury's support after appointing a new board and CEO. African News Agency

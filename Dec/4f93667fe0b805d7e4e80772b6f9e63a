CAPE TOWN - A Cape Town man has been sentenced to three life terms for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl. 32-year-old Randy Tango confessed to strangling Stacha Arendse to death after raping her. He says he wrapped her body in a sheet before dumping it on an open field in Mitchell’s Plain in March. Tango also received an additional 10 years for statutory rape, involving a 14-year-old he had raped a few years back.  Judge Henney says the sentence should serve as a warning to perpetrators of such crimes. Over fifty child murders have been reported in the Western Cape this year. Tango’s particulars have been ordered to be included in the national sex offenders list.) eNCA

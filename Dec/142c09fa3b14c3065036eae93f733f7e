JOHANNESBURG - The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal says it suspect there are moves in the province to sabotage Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's presidential bid.
	
	“There is a sustained or a consistent plan to try and undermine the numbers of the ANC in KZN. If we can give an example 20 branches," says Thanduxolo Sabelo, KZN ANC Youth League Secretary. INFOGRAPHIC: How does voting work at the ANC conference? Sabelo says in Moses Mabhida, 15 branches were excluded from the nominations which had all nominated Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and all of those branches have more than one delegate. "So that’s why we say there’s a plan to try and undermine the numbers in KZN. This seems to be cooked through the elections which has been mandated by the National Executive Committee,” he says. eNCA

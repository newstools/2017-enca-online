JOHANNESBURG - Despite the ANC's confidence that the credentials will be sorted out on Sunday, it’s unclear whether there will be a new party president by Sunday night. ANC Youth League President Collen Maine became testy when asked about the delays. He told eNCA anchors Uveka Rangappa and Dan Moyane that delegates are not unsettled. "We want to make sure that this conference proceeds and everything should be done in accordance with the rules," Maine said.

During the (sometimes) heated interview, Maine took several swipes at the media. He said they are going to be disappointed after the congress. "They think we will carry out the coffin of the ANC to bury it. "We will defeat all agendas, (including) the white monopoly capital agenda, and we will serve the interests of our people," he said. Meanwhile, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa has defended the media's role at the ANC National Elective Conference. Kodwa says ANC members shouldn't expect journalists to be nice to them. eNCA

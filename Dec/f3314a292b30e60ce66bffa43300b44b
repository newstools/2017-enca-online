JOHANNESBURG - After two days of frustration with First National Bank (FNB), which has struggled with massive downtime on Friday and Saturday, Twitter finally decided to ask FNB what it needed help with.  On Friday, clients complained about not being able to withdraw money from ATMs and access the bank's app, mobile banking, and other services. Whiles services were restored on Friday night, customers were again feeling frustrated as the bank battled another interruption in its services on Saturday. Eventually, Twitter users turned FNB's own pay-off line on its head, asking FNB: how can we help you?   eNCA

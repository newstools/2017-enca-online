JOHANNESBURG – Eastern Cape is the most homophobic province in South Africa, a survey by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) found on Tuesday. The study found rape, assault, murder and intolerance towards homosexuality is rife, especially in rural areas in South Africa. About 50 percent of people are against pupils being educated on the subject of gays and lesbians in schools. Research analyst Gerbrandt van Heerden said: “People with a tertiary education in Africa are almost three times as likely to be tolerant towards homosexuals as opposed to people who have no formal education.” In black communities, half of LGBTI members know of someone who has been a victim of hate crimes due to sexuality. Among the Indian community, LGBTI members have been discriminated against for their sexuality by their own family members.

The research, conducted between 2015 and 2016, found Gauteng and the Western Cape were among the most tolerant provinces towards homosexuality. eNCA

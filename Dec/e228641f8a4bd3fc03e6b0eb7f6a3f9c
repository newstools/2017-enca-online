LOS ANGELES - Model and television personality, Chrissy Teigen and her husband, singer John Legend, were on a flight bound for Tokyo from Los Angeles when the plane unexpectedly turned around. In a bizarre turn of events, a passenger had boarded the wrong flight and had a boarding pass from another airline. Flight attendants told Teigen the displaced passenger had a United Airlines boarding pass. As Teigen’s flight saga continued, she kept her followers updated on Twitter. The plane was taken to a secure area of the LAX runway and certain passengers were interviewed about the experience by police. Eventually, Teigen and Legend tweeted in the safety of an airline lounge. While waiting, the couple was pacified with episodes of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and ramen noodles. eNCA

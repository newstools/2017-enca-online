LONDON - Tim Visser's last-gasp try haded Saracens a third successive English Premiership defeat as Harlequins won 20-19 at the Stoop on Sunday.  Danny Care created all three of Harlequins' tries with a sublime performance, but it was Visser who ended as the hero. Visser pounced on Care's cross-field kick for the winner after the England international had set up two earlier tries for Charlie Walker.  James Lang kicked a penalty and conversion for the hosts. Brad Barritt scored Saracens' try, which Owen Farrell converted before adding four penalties. Saracens had taken an early 10-0 lead, but Harlequins hit back when a superbly-judged cross-field kick from Care saw Walker score. Farrell kicked his second penalty before there was an injury departure for Quins when skipper James Horwill limped off. After another Farrell penalty, Care dashed away and kicked ahead for Walker to win the race for the touchdown. Farrell's fourth penalty five minutes from the end looked to have secured victory for Saracens. But one final combination from Care and Visser sent the crowd home happy. AFP

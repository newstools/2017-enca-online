HARRISMITH - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) member and law student, Wenzile Madonsela tied the knot to her fiance' Khulekile Msimang in a traditional ceremony this past Saturday. Wenzile is former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela's daughter.  The couple met and fell in love whilst they were both still university students, and the pair have been inseparable ever since and have been dating for five years. The visibly elated bride smiled and chuckled throughout the ceremony. She spoke fondly about her mother and the role that she had played in her life during her speech. The private ceremony was attended by close family and friends of the couple. The former Public Protector wore a black traditional ensemble and gave a moving speech about her daughter at the wedding.

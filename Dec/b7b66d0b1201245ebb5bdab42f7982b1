JOHANNESBURG – The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has finally released the results of the Metsimaholo by-elections after major delays in the Free State. The ANC has won 16 seats, compared to the 19 it won in the 2016 Municipal Elections. 29 Nov by-election results in #Metsimaholo: ANC won 16 seats (19 seats in 2016 LGE); DA 11 seats (12 in 2016), EFF 8 seats (8 in 2016), & SACP 3 seats. 1 seat each won by AIC, Forum for Service Delivery, Metsimaholo Community Association (2 in 2016), & VFPlus (1 in 2016). The Democratic Alliance won 11 seats – that’s one less than last year. WATCH: ‘It’s too late for us, we failed,’ Zuma says The EFF retained its eight seats. And the SACP won three seats, after choosing to contest by-elections without its alliance partner.  The Metsimaholo by-elections have been marred by allegations of vote-rigging. eNCA

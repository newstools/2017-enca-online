PARIS - Australian loose forward Tala Gray has signed a deal to join Stade Francais from next season, the French Top 14 side announced on Thursday. The 27-year-old former Waratahs player has signed a two-year deal and will join from Toulouse, where he has spent the last three seasons. French prop Stephane Clement, 30, will also join from Lyon on a three-year deal at the end of the season, Stade said. The 2015 French champions Stade are currently in a lowly 11th place in the Top 14. They are away to London Irish in the European Challenge Cup on Saturday but having lost two of their opening Pool 4 matches face an uphill battle to defend the title they won last season. AFP

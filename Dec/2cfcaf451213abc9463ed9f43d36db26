JOHANNESBURG - Hip-hop artist Cassper Nyovest says he is willing to lose all his money to leave a mark on the music industry. After filling up the 20, 000 seater The Dome arena in 2015 and 35, 000 seater Orlando Stadium last year, 68, 000 fans flocked to his event at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium at the weekend. WATCH: How many questions did Cassper answer in a minute? His event attracted sponsorship from SABC 1, Standard Bank, Ciroc, Budweiser and the Department of Arts and Culture. “I’m still broke right now because we’re waiting for all these sponsorship and ticket sales money to come in,” Nyovest said on eNCA’s Afternoon News. “I went all in. I had my friends pay my staff and one of them pay my electricity bill. I was about to sell my cars as well, because for me it’s not about material stuff. I’ve invested myself and I’m invested into the SA music industry and I want to leave it in a better place. “People won’t remember me for the cars I drove but the impact I had on my people and industry. So that’s what really matters to me. I don’t mind losing all this money as long as I know I’m investing it into what gave a chance to live a better life.” Watch the full interview in the gallery above. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Selborne College in the Eastern Cape has apologised over a controversial image. The image was used on an invitation to a matric reunion and references the iconic picture showing a dying Hector Pieterson taken in June 1976. In the school's poster, the faces of those in the original picture are replaced with those of dogs. So the @SelborneCollege distasteful picture was an invite to the old boys ceremony! #Selbornecollege pic.twitter.com/jJfy0f1cgg Pieterson's face appears to have been entirely removed. READ: 'We are tired' - Pretoria High School for Girls pupils The controversial image has sparked outrage, with social media users calling it distasteful and insensitive. The college has apologised, and says it recognises the offence and hurt the image has caused. One logs off for a few hours to come to this nonsense that some of @SelborneCollege matriculants find hilarious

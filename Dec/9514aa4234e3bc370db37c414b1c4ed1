JOHANNESBURG â€“ Selborne College in the Eastern Cape has apologised over a controversial image. The image was used on an invitation to a matric reunion and references the iconic picture showing a dying Hector Pieterson taken in June 1976. In the school's poster, the faces of those in the original picture are replaced with those of dogs. Pieterson's face appears to have been entirely removed.

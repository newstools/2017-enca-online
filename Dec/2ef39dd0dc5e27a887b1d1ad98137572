Fed up with the lack of progress made against those implicated in state capture allegations by the National Prosecuting Authority, the civil society group wants alleged looters to personally pay back the money, and put it back into the fiscus. Apart from recovering money, other relief sought will be asking the court to declare the respondents guilty of failing to report corruption as required under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act. eNCA

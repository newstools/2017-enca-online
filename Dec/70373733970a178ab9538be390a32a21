JOHANNESBURG – South African society remains divided on cultural, racial and class lines despite the prioritisation of reconciliation, President Jacob Zuma said in a statement on Friday. He made the comments ahead of Reconciliation Day on Saturday, themed “The Year of OR Tambo: Reconciliation through Radical Socio-Economic Transformation." Zuma called on the country to multiply efforts at reconciliation and to work together in order to promote unity, social cohesion and peace for the common good of all in South Africa. “We believe that each one of us has a role to play in healing the wounds of the past, reconciling our communities and working to build a new nation. We encourage all our people on this day to work together to bridge the divide created by our ugly past and to move towards a united society,” Zuma said. “Take time to learn about fellow South Africans. We would like to encourage South Africans to speak to an acquaintance or colleague about their life experience as we believe that by talking, sharing and learning, we will break down barriers,” the statement read. “We must continue to work together to build a more inclusive economy that truly reflects the demographics of the country. Working with business, labour and the community sector, we have to change the ownership, control and management of the economy so that it benefits all,” Zuma added. The president called on South Africans to build on the legacy of the Constitution and Freedom Charter. eNCA

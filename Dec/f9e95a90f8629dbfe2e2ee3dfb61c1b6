JOHANNESBURG – Inkosi Vela Shembe of the Thembezinhle faction of the Nazareth Baptist Church is being laid to rest on Sunday and his successor will be named on the 16 of December, church spokesperson Nkululeko Mthethwa said. Vela, also known as Imisebe yelanga, passed away last week of natural cause complaining about pain in his legs. It was expected that Shembe's successor will be named at his funeral on Sunday. However, following the controversy surrounding the 2011 event where Vela and his nephew Mduduzi "Unyazi Lwezulu" Shembe were both mentioned as successors of Vimbeni Shembe, the Umthwalume-based faction decided against naming the successor on the day of the funeral. Mthethwa said the decision not to name the successor on Sunday was so that the church will have time to mourn and not repeat what happened in 2011.

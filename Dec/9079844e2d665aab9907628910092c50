JOHANNESBURG – Malawian Prophet Shepherd Bushiri is at it again. Bushiri has taken to social media to show a top of the range Maserati Levante worth R1.5-million as a birthday present for an under-aged child in his family. The prophet last week was reported to be charging congregants R25,000 to sit next to him at a gala dinner. Users on social media were stunned by the prophet's post. “I always count myself blessed during this time of the year because I get the honor to celebrate, not only one but two God-given gifts in my life,” reads the post.  eNCA

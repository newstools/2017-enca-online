It’s a day the judiciary drew a line in the sand to help us charter a way forward as South Africans," says Mmusi Maimane, the DA leader. "The very significant thing is that Jacob Zuma is now a man liable for legal fees of R6-million  and today we’re going to open a case to charge him with perjury."  The high court in Pretoria dismissed with costs Zuma's application for an order reviewing and setting aside the Public Protector's State of Capture report and her finding that a judicial commission of inquiry be instituted into state capture, under a judge nominated by the chief justice. eNCA

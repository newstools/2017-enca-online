They were badly assaulted. Reggie appeared in court with a broken shoulder, Indres had a gun wound. When they came out of jail 10 years later, and Laloo 18 years later, they were back in the trenches. That generation is passing at a time when the country and the ANC needs renewal of its ethical orientation," said Cachalia. eNCA

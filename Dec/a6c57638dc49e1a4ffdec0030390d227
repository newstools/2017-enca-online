JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela hopes his charges will end 2017 on a positive note when they take on Ajax Cape Town in their final Premiership game of the year at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday evening. “We want to finish the year on a high,” said Komphela. “We swiftly recovered from the loss against Chippa United with last week’s win in Rustenburg. There’s now an air of optimism in the camp. Beating Platinum Stars has returned confidence in the camp.” “We want to give our supporters an early Christmas. We have some forced changes due to suspensions.” READ: Castro set to join Kaizer Chiefs next year Joseph Molangoane and Willard Katsande are both suspended. “We have the players to do the job in their absence,” Komphela points out. “The good news is that Kgotso Moleko is back from injury, while Ramahlwe Mphahlele is making steady progress and should be ready soon.” Ajax are a side and have some good players to watch. “Thabo Mosadi has been doing well and they have some other players to watch out for too,” the Chiefs mentor explains. “They collected maximum points against Chippa United in their last match. I’m sure that they are haunted by their low position on the log, which will make them dangerous visitors. However, we have devised a good plan to dominate and beat them. We just have to score from the chances that we create.” READ: Putsche nets winner for Cape Town City against AmaZulu Chiefs are now in fourth spot with 19 points from 14 games.

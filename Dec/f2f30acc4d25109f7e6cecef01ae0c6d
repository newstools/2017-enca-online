JOHANNESBURG - The 2019 ballot paper could grow by at least one new name. The African Democratic Change (ADeC) is looking to contest the next general elections. Former ANC MP, Makhosi Khoza has launched the party, saying it’s a new moral and ethical political home for disillusioned South Africans. WATCH: Change afoot as Khoza launches new political party? Khoza, who became a household name for her outspoken anti-corruption stance during Parliament’s SABC inquiry earlier this year, quit the ANC in late September. She says the decline in ANC support at the polls last year, did not necessarily translate into an increase in support for other parties, prompting her to start a new one. "To me, it says there are people that are so disillusioned, they are not finding an alternative out of all these parties in existence," says Khoza.  ADeC will hold its policy conference in early 2018 and hopes to compete in the elections in 2019. Issac Shongwe, a founding member, says change couldn’t come soon enough. “How long are we going to be marching and marching with nothing changing? People have been saying there has to be change at the top. How many votes of no confidence?" Khoza says she won’t be wasting any of her energy on the naysayers as she embarks on what she concedes is a daunting task. “We had a lot of political parties that were established last year that contested local government elections. Why is it a big problem now that Makhosi Khoza is coming? Probably I have more to offer and that is why people are worried?” ADeC says it is founded on the principles of the Freedom Charter and Ubuntu. Khoza says she’s hoping to create a new political home for people that have never entered politics, or for those who are currently unhappy in their political parties.  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – A husky and an owl are inseparable. This is N’usha the snowy owl and Ilona the husky seem to love each others company.  In the cold weather, the two mates snug up together to share what humans know to be an affectionate kiss. N’usha and Ilona have a monochromatic effect going on with their matching black and white fur and feather color scheme. These two are normally seen together on social media, hanging, eating, resting and sharing several kisses too. eNCA

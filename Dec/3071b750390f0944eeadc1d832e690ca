JOHANNESBURG - The ANC 54th elective conference has been adjourned. Â The plenary session will continue on Sunday at 9 am. ANC chairperson Baleka Mbete says the party is still busy trying to sort out credentials. Earlier disgruntled party members wanted to lodge complaints about their branches, which are not meant to be at the conference. Some are even said they wanted their branch delegates to be removed from the gathering. The disputes are mostly about the legality of the members representing them. eNCA

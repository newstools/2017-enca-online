JOHANNESBURG - The ANC Youth League in Limpopo says it's not worried by the outcome of the provincial general council. The province has nominated Cyril Ramaphosa as it preferred presidential candidate, while the youth league wants Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next ANC president. The Youth League says the branches of the ANC did not reject Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. It says "in actual fact branches of the ANC nominated her and they have also nominated Cyril".Â  INFOGRAPHIC: How does voting work at the ANC conference? "It's just that in terms fo numbers Cyril got more numbers, therefor Nkosazan got the lowest," says David Selane, ANCYL Limpopo Secretary. Selane says they are still maintaining their view that Dlamini-Zuma must be the president of the party. "The numbers of branches do not mean that is the delegates that are going to the conference. Now we are dealing with nomination . In terms of delegation, hey we are going to surprise you. I am telling you we are in charge of this province," he says. eNCA

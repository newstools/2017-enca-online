JOHANNESBURG – The nominations for the ANC leadership from the provinces have been calculated and consolidated after the nine provinces held their provincial general council meetings. Five provinces have nominated ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma as party leader while closest rival Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has received the backing of three provinces. Mpumalanga has nominated a 'unity' candidate. The political landscape has differed across the provinces leading up to the 54th National Conference of the ANC, due to be held next week at Nasrec, south of Johannesburg. Here are the various problems which every province has faced leading up to the conference.

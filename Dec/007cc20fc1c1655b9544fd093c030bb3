JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has averted legal action in the wake of its 54th elective conference - at least for now.  Lawyers for the so-called Nasrec 68 - voters who were registered for the ANC's 54th national conference, but found that they were not on the voter's roll - meeting with ANC representatives at Luthuli House on Friday. They have agreed not to proceed with legal action at this stage, but to deal with the issue in the new year.  The 68 were allowed to vote, but their votes were sealed. It is still unclear what decisions were made regarding whether all or any of these votes were counted in determining the outcome of the hotly-disputed Secretary General position, in which Ace Magushule beat Senzo Mchunu by 24 votes. This was later adjusted to nine votes when 15 additional votes were allocated to Mchunu after a recount. Mchunu's angry supporters, who had earlier celebrated his expected victory, threatened legal action despite ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa calling on them to accept the result in the interest of unity. Magashule's original victory by 24 votes had also followed a recount, after Mchunu received the most votes in the first count for the position.  Unsubstantiated allegations have pointed to certain of Mchunu's votes being removed in order to ensure victory for controversial Free State Premier Magashule, adding further mystery to the entire voting process. eNCA

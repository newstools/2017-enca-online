MPUMALANGA - It was only a few months ago that Khaya Mthethwa got involved with former Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene. Now the pair have been joined in matrimony. The beautiful traditional wedding ceremony took place in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga at the weekend. The brideÂ was dressed in isiSwazi traditional regalia and later wore isiZulu attire, which means she has been joined with the groom and his side of the family.

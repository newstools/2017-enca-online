Chasing a big total none of the Afghanistan batsmen capitalised on good starts with Rahmat Shah (32), Mohammad Nabi (29) and Nasir Jamal (25) also losing wickets after getting well set. McCarthy, whose previous best of 4-59 also came against Afghanistan at Belfast last year, sparked a collapse which saw Afghanistan lose their last six wickets for a mere 38 runs. Ireland were put on the track of a solid total by Stirling who put 115 for the opening stand with skipper William Porterfield (47), a new record against Afghanistan, beating 113 Stirling and Ed Joyce put in Noida (Delhi, India) earlier this year. Stirling hit eight boundaries and a six. Dockrell gave the late order lift to the innings with a 48-ball 62 not out spiced with seven fours and a six. AFP

LONDON - Swansea City has appointed Carlos Carvalhal as manager until the end of the season with an option of an extension, the Premier League club said on Thursday. Carvalhal parted company with second-tier Sheffield Wednesday on Christmas Eve after two and a half years at Hillsborough, leading them to Championship play-offs in successive seasons. The 52-year-old Portuguese replaces Paul Clement, who left the Welsh club earlier this month propping up the league.

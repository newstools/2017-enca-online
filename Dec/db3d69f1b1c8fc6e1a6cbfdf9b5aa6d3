JOHANNESBURG - Former President Kgalema Motlanthe says he wishes the current crop of young ANC leaders could learn from the likes of Laloo Chiba. Motlanthe was paying tribute to the late ANC stalwart and former Robben Island prisoner at a memorial service in Lenasia. WATCH: Laloo Chiba memorial "I wished that comrade Laloo could be used as an example of the commitment and selflessness and humility. He could have shared this with the younger members of the African National Congress," he says.Â  "But there is a barrier of conceit and arrogance and complacency in the part of the organisation which makes the organisation poorer, because instead of imbibing from the leaders such as comrade Laloo, the younger people in the ANC have new role models who present themselves as people who are committed to some revolution which is ill-defined and have absolutely no time to listen to the likes of Comrade Laloo Chiba," says Montlanthe. eNCA

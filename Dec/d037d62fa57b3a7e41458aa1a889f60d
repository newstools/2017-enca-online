The hearing, led by former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, is probing the deaths of 143 mentally ill patients after the Gauteng Health Department transferred them form the Esidimeni to unregistered NGOs. Earlier on Monday the Johannesburg High Court dismissed an application by suspended Gauteng Health head of department Barney Selebano to set aside a subpoena for him to testify at the hearing. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says that a court judgment against a region of the party will have no impact on the party’s national conference. Just one day before the start of the 54th ANC national conference, the North West High Court nullified the Bojanala regional conference and set aside 32 branch general meetings.

He further stated that they will accept the court judgment but stressed that the judiciary does not run the ANC. Provincial Executive Committees of the ANC have voting right at the national conference. Each have been given 27 voting rights and should a court rule to nullify a PEC, they will thus lose 27 voting delegates. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Taking a dip in the pool or surfing the waves is part and parcel of the summer holidays.  Unfortunately, there is also an increase in drownings at this time of the year. According to the head of clinical leadership at Netcare 911, David Stanton, the company's statistics show that the most drowning incidents happen during peak holiday periods. "This is attributable to the high volumes of tourists, both foreign and local, who flock to the beaches during school holidays and over the festive season.” More than half of drownings during December and January happens near the coast, while the biggest percentage of incidents during the year occurs in KwaZulu-Natal.  Ways to Stay Safe Near Water by Andrea van Wyk What to do in the event of a drowning by Andrea van Wyk According to Stanton, having multiple layers of safety -- such as a certified pool safety net, a fence with locked gate, a child-minder and a surface alarm around the pool and spa areas at home or around other open bodies of water -- can prevent accidents and drownings. “A basic course in first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can make a dramatic difference in the outcome should the skills be applied timeously,” says Stanton. eNCA

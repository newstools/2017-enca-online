EAST LONDON - No sign has been found of a man believed to have drowned at a beach in East London in the Eastern Cape on Sunday morning, but a search is continuing, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said. NSRI East London duty crew were activated at 6.10am following reports of a drowning in progress at Eastern Beach, NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon said. The sea rescue craft Spirit of Rotary EL II and the Lotto Rescue Runner were launched and NSRI rescue swimmers and the South African Police Service (SAPS), a police K9 search and rescue team, a police dive unit, and the Buffalo City fire and rescue services responded, he said. “Despite an extensive search, no sign of a 25-year-old local man has been found. "We believe that a group of people were swimming when the missing man was caught in rip currents before disappearing underwater. "Police K9 search and rescue and a police dive unit will continue an ongoing search operation, and police have opened an investigation,” Lambinon said. African News Agency

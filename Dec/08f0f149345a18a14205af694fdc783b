JOHANNESBURG – The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has re-iterated its calls to the African National Congress (ANC) to have President Jacob Zuma recalled. The Foundation on Friday released a statement urging the party to recall the president at the coming elective conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg. “The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation calls on delegates to put the country’s needs first and take a resolution that would see President Zuma being recalled from office,” the statement reads. “ANC delegates have the opportunity to ensure that the man who has betrayed the hopes and dreams of the people of South Africa no longer leads the country.” READ: Kathrada Foundation hypocritical: ANCYL KZN It has based its latest call on the North Gaurteng High Court’s ruling Wednesday. A full bench of the court found that Zuma cannot appoint a new prosecutions boss because there is a conflict in that the NPA is deciding whether to bring back charges of fraud and corruption against him. "President Zuma was this week found to be in flagrant disregard of his Constitutional duties towards the public protector and was ordered to personally pay the costs of attempting to interdict the release of the State of Capture Report and to set aside its recommendations." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) president Bathabile Dlamini is sticking to her guns on her comments about judges - or is she? She previously accused the judiciary of trying to control the State from the bench.

Dlamini says resolving internal disputes in the courts is undermining the party. She was echoing an earlier call made by President Jacob Zuma. According to Dlamini, it’s unlikely the outcome of the national conference will be challenged in court. On Friday, courts nullified ANC elective conferences in the Free State and KwaZulu-Natal as well as a regional conference in the North West. "The outcome of the court is not superior to the conference of the ANC. But what is important is that we are going to follow the judgement so that we don't find ourselves with problems with our conference. We are going to follow the judgments to the letter," Dlamini added. eNCA

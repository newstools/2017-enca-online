READ: Eskom rolls out power cuts to indebted municipalities They say Eskom's decision to cut power during the day to defaulting municipalities is unfair. The municipality allegedly owes Eskom R141-million. The issue here is electricity, where we owe Eskom R141-million. Commenting on the protest, Councillor Msokoli Jan said, "The municipal manager, and the mayor (don't) want to go to Eskom to make arrangements. They decided not to attend a meeting, so we find ourselves in this situation. "Eskom is disconnecting electricity from 6am during the week until 8am and in the afternoons from 5.30pm until 7.30pm and on Saturdays from 8am until 11am, and from 3pm until 5pm. "So the community is living under that situation... We've been trying to petition the speaker (without success)". eNCA

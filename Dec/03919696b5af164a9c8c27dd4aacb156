JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) says its deadline for the National Prosecuting Authority's Head Shaun Abrahams to hand over President Jacob Zuma's representations has expired. The deadline relates to Zuma explaining why he should not face 18 charges relating to 783 counts of fraud, corruption, and money-laundering. READ: DA demands NPA to reinstate corruption charges against Zuma "We cannot allow Shaun Abrahams to consider the representations in secret," DA leader, Mmusi Maimane's spokesperson Portia Adams. "He [Abrahams] can't be trusted to oversee this matter in an independent and robust matter. For almost a year Abrahams has been ducking and diving on a number of issues most notably the Gupta leaks and the rot of state capture perpetrated by Jacob Zuma and the ANC. That's why we're saying as such this matter must be dealt with by a court of law to guarantee independence," she added. eNCA

MPUMALANGA - uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans' Association (MKMVA) members in Mpumalanga are denying claims they are used to intimidate and disrupt ANC meetings, which are not in favour of unity. A new video has emerged, showing MKMVA members accompanying an ANC deployee to a meeting venue. The people in uniform are refused entry and the word unity is tossed around. Members of the MKMVA in Mpumalanga are furious with ANC presidential candidate, Mathews Phosa, for linking video of ANC members firing guns recklessly in a crowded area to the party’s branch general meetings. EXCLUSIVE: Phosa makes shock allegation against Mabuza Now another video has emerged, potentially linking the Mpumalanga MKMVA to the so-called 'unity' campaign. The ANC in the province admits it uses the MKMVA for security purposes at its meetings. According to Sasekani Manzini, Mpumalanga ANC spokesperson: “As a measure, to say maybe go and assist, we sometimes use MK to go and assist in terms of that comrades don’t fight among themselves. That we do.” Manzini infers the MKMVA is feared by ANC members. “Our members they respect MKMVA, so sometimes they won’t fight if they see that there’s MK. They don’t play a role, they don’t speak in that meeting. They only assist when there is a challenge. That’s how we use them as MKMVA.” The ANC in Mpumalanga has reacted to the video, saying it perfectly demonstrates the role the MKMVA was playing, to maintain peace, and not to enforce the so-called 'unity' campaign. eNCA

CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) has warned beachgoers and other water users to exercise extreme caution around the coast on Sunday and over this coming week, with the new moon spring tide peaking on Monday. “NSRI are urging public awareness about spring tides to highlight safety around the coast and general safety to bathers, anglers, paddlers, sailboarders, and boaters around the coast. "With the new moon spring tide now upon us beach bathers and shoreline anglers are most at risk,” NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon said. Swim at beaches only where lifeguards were on duty and obey the safety instructions of the lifeguards, and only swim within the safe swimming zones lifeguards mark (using their red and yellow flags). Children should have responsible adult supervision around water. Anglers fishing along the shoreline, particularly along rocks on the shoreline, were at greatest risk during the spring tide where incoming waves during the high tides encroached higher than normal over rocks. Anglers should not turn their back to the sea and should be vigilant and cautious of the wave action at all times while fishing. The next spring tide would be the full moon spring tide on 2 January, Lambinon said. African News Agency

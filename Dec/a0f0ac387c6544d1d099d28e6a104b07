JOHANNESBURG - ANC presidential hopeful Mathews Phosa has reached an agreement with the party's national office. The parties resolved that disputes in Mpumalanga would be dealt with out of court and ahead of the elective conference at the weekend. Phosa approached the courts to have Mpumalanga's nomination process declared null and void. EXCLUSIVE: Phosa makes shock allegation against Mabuza The ANC agreed to send a task team to Mpumalanga to investigate all claims of disruptions. The ANC agreed that Phosa’s branches were affected in Mpumalanga as a result of intimidation by David Mabuza’s so-called ‘goons’. READ: Members aligned to Phosa 'withdraw urgency' of court case It remains to be seen how this will affect the commencement of the conference, which will take place at Nasrec, south west of Johannesburg, from Saturday. No deal The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC), however, says no deal has been reached with Phosa’s faction. Mpumalanga ANC Secretary Mandla Ndlovu said: "They said that they will withdraw, provided the NEC establish a task-team to deal with their complaints. They said that they will withdraw this case provided that they are not going to pay the costs. We said no." Phosa's campaign manager Ronnie Malomane said the national ANC office assured it was commitment to a process with branches aligned to Phosa. eNCA

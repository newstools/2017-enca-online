LONDON - Britain's Princes William and Harry joined the cast of the new film Star Wars: The Last Jedi, in which the royal brothers both play small roles, on the red carpet at the film's European premiere in London on Tuesday. The event, at the Royal Albert Hall, saw stars including Mark Hammill, John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver join the princes on the red carpet, surrounded by an honour guard of armour-clad storm-troopers. "It's not only the most action-packed, it's just the most emotional, it pulls you in several different directions, it's spontaneous," Boyega told Reuters of his impressions of the Walt Disney film, which is widely expected to top 2017's global box office. The stars were out in Force tonight for the European Royal Premiere of #TheLastJedi.

The pair filmed their parts during a visit to the film's set in Pinewood Studios near London in 2016. Reuters

JOHANNESBURG - With just 18 days before the Afropunk stage is lit in South Africa, bands out-sang and out-performed each other to display just how badly they wanted the top spot. The semifinals were held at Johannesburg club Carfax where bands displayed their talent and musical capabilities in front of the judges and crowds on two nights. The ultimate winners, who will go home with a R15,000 prize, will have the opportunity to share the stage with American stars Solange Knowles and Anderson Paak as well as South African greats The Free Nationals, Laura Mvula and King Tha vs BLK JKS. Bands that made it past this stage were Cape Town-based band Stiff Pap, rock band Automatic Live, gender-blended art collective Pg13, Rainbow Abomination and Melo B Jones.

JOHANNESBURG – Uganda’s opposition plans to challenge a new amendment to the constitution to remove the presidential age limit in court, Kenya’s Daily Nation reports. On Wednesday Uganda’s Parliament in the capital Kampala voted to change a current law which disqualifies those aged under 35 and over 75 from running for the presidency which would prevent incumbent President Yoweri Museveni, 73, who has ruled the country since 1986, from standing in the 2021 elections. The amended legislation will allow Museveni to serve a sixth term in office after MPs argued that the law was age discriminatory. However, opposition activists countered that it’s a ploy by the leader of the East African country to stay in power despite the president years ago criticising African leaders who stayed beyond their legitimate terms. “We are going to challenge the process in court. We want to let Ugandans know that we played our part and now we are giving the ball to the Ugandans in a new campaign K’ogikutteko,” Winnie Kizza the leader of the opposition party said on Thursday as she addressed journalists. The highly controversial bill passed with 315 votes for, 62 against and two abstentions, after three days of chaotic debates in which some opposition MPs were suspended, while others walked out. The bill will pass into law once it is signed by Museveni. In September when the bill was first being debated mayhem broke out in Parliament leading to fist fights, chairs being thrown and some MPs being frog marched out of the parliament. Ugandan security forces, accompanied by tanks deployed heavily in Kampala and outside Parliament where they subsequently clashed with protesters. African News Agency

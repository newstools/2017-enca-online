JOHANNESBURG - The suspended Head of Department (HOD) of the Gauteng Department of Health, Dr Barney Selebano has admitted he acted unlawfully when he signed off on the transfer of patients from Life Esidimeni.  After much back and forth, Adv Groenewald gets Dr Selebano to concede that as counsel read it, he is guilty of an offense given the legislation governing health care professionals. #LifeEsidimeni tribunal. pic.twitter.com/bABB9ktTrv Selebano has been testifying at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings that are investigating the death of more than 140 mentally ill patients after the state transferred them from the Life Esidimeni hospital to unregistered NGOs.  Selebano's court bid to avoid testifying at the hearings failed.  'A wrong remains a wrong, whether or not you view it from hindsight,' says Adv Groenewald.
		'I need your help,' pleads Dr Selebano.
		Justice Groenewald outlines the meaning in law and common sense.#LifeEsidimeni tribunal pic.twitter.com/2aWfzfydxx 'Do you know about risk management in project management? Have you heard about a tracking system in a project? All of those things must be known to an HOD, surely,' asks Justice Moseneke utterly exasperated in #LifeEsidimeni tribunal. pic.twitter.com/eS1YH1g0o5 Justice Moseneke is incredulous when Dr Selebano says 'you only know if the plan for the house will work after you have built it.'

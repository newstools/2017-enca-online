JOHANNESBURG - The suspended Head of Department (HOD) of the Gauteng Department of Health, Dr Barney Selebano has admitted he acted unlawfully when he signed off on the transfer of patients from Life Esidimeni.  Selebano has been testifying at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings that are investigating the death of more than 140 mentally ill patients after the state transferred them from the Life Esidimeni hospital to unregistered NGOs.  Selebano's court bid to avoid testifying at the hearings failed.  Justice Moseneke is incredulous when Dr Selebano says 'you only know if the plan for the house will work after you have built it.'

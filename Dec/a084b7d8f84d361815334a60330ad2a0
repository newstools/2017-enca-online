PARIS, France – Former Stormers fullback Cheslin Kolbe has been hailed as the best signing in French rugby this season. Kolbe moved to France to join Top 14 side Toulouse before for the start of the 2017–2018 season and has been a strong performer for the team ever since. Respected French rugby newspaper Midi Olympique featured Kolbe in their review of French rugby signings this season. Surprisingly New Zealand players were ranked among the worst signings in French Top 14 rugby this year. According to the newspaper, three former All Blacks have been named in a “Flop 10” list of worst French rugby signings from 2017, headed by former Blues star Luke McAlister who headed the list. Former Blues wing Frank Halai, who joined Pau this season after leaving English club Wasps, was the fourth-worst signing while former Chiefs hooker Hika Elliot came ninth.  He turned out for last-placed club Oyonnax.

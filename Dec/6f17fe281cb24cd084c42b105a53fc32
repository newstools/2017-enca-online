BIRMINGHAM - Birmingham has been chosen as the host venue for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, organisers announced on Thursday with the Midlands city being the only bidder. Commonwealth Games Federation President Louise Martin announced the decision at a press conference in the city. "We warmly congratulate Birmingham and England on today's announcement – it is a defining moment for this truly Commonwealth city," she said. "With its rich history, cultural diversity, youthful dynamism and ambitious spirit, Birmingham embodies all that we cherish about the Commonwealth." Durban, South Africa was originally awarded the Games in 2015 before being stripped of the event in March because it failed to meet promises contained in its bid. Birmingham was chosen as Britain's candidate city in September, beating a rival bid from Liverpool and receiving UK government backing.

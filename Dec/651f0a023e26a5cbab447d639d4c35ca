CAPE TOWN - ANC MP Mervyn Dirks may face disciplinary action after he allegedly threatened and attempted to assault a colleague in Parliament. Dirks was removed from the house after he showed his middle finger to MPs. He denies the incident occurred. The ANC’s Dirks ejected from the House. No not because he assaulted a fellow MP, but because he threw up a middle finger. What a Dirk! pic.twitter.com/leyEMCXxnX Some of Dirks's fellow party members were not impressed by his behaviour.  The office of the ANC Chief Whip in Parliament, in a strongly-worded statement condemned Thursday’s incident. "The behaviour of ANC MP Mervyn Dirks was despicable and not in keeping with the image of Parliament and the organisation he represents - the African National Congress," the statement read. "On Thursday, 30 November 2017, member Dirks allegedly insulted and threatened to assault another ANC MP Thozama Mantashe. "Member Dirks further went on to show his middle finger to other members of Parliament. This member also allegedly called other members of Parliament dogs on his Facebook account. "The ANC Chief Whip has written to the Speaker of the National Assembly requesting an investigation into this incident. If found to be true, these actions cannot go unpunished." eNCA

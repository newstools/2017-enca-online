JOHANNESBURG - The festive season would be nothing without some spectacular Christmas lights.  It is impossible to resist the twinkling and sparkling magic that decorates trees, buildings and special structures at night.  Since the start of December, cities around the world, even in places you would not associate with Christmas, have been displaying beautiful lights.  In Cape Town, South Africa, the water shortage is so dire not once cannot forget about it even during Christmas.  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – R2.5 million has been recovered by cops in a cash-for-votes scheme, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula confirmed on Tuesday. The ANC's elective conference, which kicks off on Saturday, will see the governing party elect a new top six, including a new party president. Mbalula was not forthright about whether the cash seized is linked to the ANC's succession race. The minister tweeted a picture with bags of money, referring to an intelligence-driven operation, saying money launderers are very sophisticated but that police would "crush them decisively." Social media users quickly noted though that the picture was an old one and clearly not of cash seized recently. Defending his tweets, the minister said the picture was used as an illustration. "I happen to be the Minister of Police - and you use Google Reverse Search to challenge a tweet that speaks to what is happening now. It’s called image illustration," Mbalula tweeted. The ministry of police is yet to respond to requests for comment on the Minister's tweets. 2.5m cash intercepted #VotesForCash pic.twitter.com/EDWM6oz8vl Intelligence driven operation the money launderous are very sophisticated but we will crush them decisively...# VotesForCash pic.twitter.com/cjoOImASAF eNCA

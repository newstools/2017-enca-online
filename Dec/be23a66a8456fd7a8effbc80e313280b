According to Pauw, “We would’ve said in our applications and we have evidence that Colonel Govender is a, to put it very lightly and mildly, he’s a very compromised policeman. "We have found several cases where he has been described as sort of like the pet cop for Roy Moodley, who we have evidence is the complainant against us. "Moodley is a close associate of President Jacob Zuma, and he’s the man that paid the president the salary while he was president. "Now there’s evidence that Govender has been acting on behalf of Moodley...He’s been bringing trump of charges against people," said Pauw. eNCA

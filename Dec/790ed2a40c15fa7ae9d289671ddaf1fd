JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) will announce current president Jacob Zuma's successor as party leader on Sunday as it looks to conclude a bruising leadership battle and focus on policy. Party spokesman Zizi Kodwa told radio station 702 on Friday that "this item from the conference agenda as quickly as possible".  "On Sunday morning as we arrive, we should be able to make an announcement of the top six and take the nomination of the rest of the leadership." The ANC holds an election this weekend to replace Zuma as party leader in a closely fought contest whose winner is likely to emerge as the nation's next president. The front-runners are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader and one of South Africa's richest people, and Zuma's preferred candidate, his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former minister and chairwoman of the African Union Commission.

The structure includes the president, deputy and key positions of secretary general and treasurer. In the last 18 months, the executive has been the scene of fierce factional battles as Zuma's leadership came under scrutiny, particularly after the most recent cabinet reshuffle in March that saw Pravin Gordhan fired as finance minister. In August, Zuma narrowly survived an umpteenth attempt in Parliament to force him from office after some members of his party voted with the opposition. Reuters

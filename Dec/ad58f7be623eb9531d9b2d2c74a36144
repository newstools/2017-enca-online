JOHANNESBURG – National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Shaun Abrahams has been given notice not to withdraw fraud, corruption and other charges against President Jacob Zuma.  The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) on Wednesday gave Abrahams a January deadline to give assurances that the charges would not be dropped. Last week, Johannesburg's Constitutional Court ruled against Abrahams's appointment as prosecutions boss and said he could not decide on the matter involving Zuma. The ruling effectively declared Abrahams’s appointment null and void as a result of an unlawful R17.3 million golden handshake paid to his predecessor Mxolisi Nxasana. READ: Shaun Abrahams' appointment as prosecutions boss set aside Casac’s Lawson Naidoo said: “The Constitutional Court now in its direction said that Mr Abrahams should be excluded from taking such a decision because it will be tainted by perceptions of bias at the very least because of the manner of his appointment. Until such time that a new, permanently appointed National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) is in place, we believe that no decision should be taken with regards to Mr Zuma's charges. “We know Mr Abrahams has extended the deadline for Mr Zuma to make representations regarding these charges to the end of January and we certainly hope that the Constitutional Court will hear this matter as one of urgency so that a new NDPP can be appointed as soon as possible so that these charges can be properly prosecuted," he added. Casac gave Abrahams until 5 January to make several undertakings. Additional reporting by ANA eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Archbishop Emeritus Njongonkulu Ndungane on Friday appealed to the African National Congress (ANC) delegates to choose “accountable, ethical leadership that puts people first.” The former Archbishop of Cape Town made the comments as the party heads into its 54th National Elective Conference to elect a new top six in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg. “Against this backdrop, those gathering at Nasrec for the ANC conference need to be acutely aware of the far-reaching impact of the decisions they make, particularly in respect of the country’s future leadership,” Ndungane said in a statement.

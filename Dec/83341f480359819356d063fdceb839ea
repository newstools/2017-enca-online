GRAHAMSTOWN - The court application to nullify the ANC Eastern Cape PEC has been dismissed with costs. No reasons were given. The case was brought by 11 party members who were dissatisfied with the election results which named Oscar Mabuyane as the new ANC EC chairperson. At least eight delegates were injured when violence erupted during proceedings in October. The fight centered on the adoption of credentials. WATCH: Chairs fly, police shoot rubber bullets at ANC EC conference The conference was marred by violence amid claims of massive irregularities by a group aligned to ousted ANC chair, Phumulo Masualle. Several members were forced to leave and could not cast their votes. The province's newly elected PEC has picked Cyril Ramaphosa to lead the party. Those bringing the court action support his opponent Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane announced the election of the top five will not take place because of the "cleaning up of the credential report". But the legitimacy of the new Provincial Executive Committee looks set to be challenged in court.  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

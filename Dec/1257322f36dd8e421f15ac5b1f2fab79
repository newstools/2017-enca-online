JOHANNESBURG - Credentials are finally being presented at the ANC's National Elective Conference, more than 20 hours later than scheduled. The number delegates at the conference stands at 4,776. To win the election, a candidate needs 2,389 votes.  Credentials must be finalised before delegates can vote for the party's leadership. Disgruntled ANC delegates filled out accreditation disputes as the party's conference got underway on Saturday. Some accused the party of accrediting bogus delegates.

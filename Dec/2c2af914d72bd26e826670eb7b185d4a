JOHANNESBURG - After two days of frustration with First National Bank (FNB), which has struggled with massive downtime on Friday and Saturday, Twitter finally decided to ask FNB what it needed help with.  Whats wrong with FNB, how could we help them? #FNB #Banking @FNBSA, how can you ask ‘how can we help you’ when you need help yourself? #FNB On Friday, clients complained about not being able to withdraw money from ATMs and access the bank's app, mobile banking, and other services. "Select services?" I can't use Internet Banking for what I need, I can't pay with my FNB/RMB/Discovery credit cards! On the FIRST day of the month! Ridiculous. #badservice pic.twitter.com/Sg7aEmq9eP Whiles services were restored on Friday night, customers were again feeling frustrated as the bank battled another interruption in its services on Saturday. Been holding the line for over 20 minutes, sir, this is pathetic. #FNB #FNB #Badservice, if you want to know how you guys can help me? You can do that by closing every account that I have with you. @Rbjacobs Eventually, Twitter users turned FNB's own pay-off line on its head, asking FNB: how can we help you?  Guys FNB is down and I am at Chicken Licken with no cash. This is mad awkward & I'm hungry. Can any non FNB person sponsor me R50 & I'll pay you back as soon as FNB is functional again I swear  eNCA

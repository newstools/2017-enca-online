JOHANNESBURG – For the third consecutive year, rapper Cassper Nyovest successfully attracted a massive crowd to his concert. After successful shows at The Dome in 2015 and Orlando Stadium last year, the Tito Mboweni hitmaker performed in front of a reported 68, 000 fans at FNB Stadium in the south of Johannesburg. Performances on the night included Distruction Boyz, Nadia Nakai, Kwesta and Riky Rick. It always looks impossible ... until it’s done. #FillUpFNBStadium pic.twitter.com/iCyNzWnkJb King @CassperNyovest making history, showing South Africans we can never dream too big, we can achieve anything and that hard work pays off.

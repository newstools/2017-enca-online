JOHANNESBURG – South African Rugby fans are calling for coach Allister Coetzee's head following a 24-22 loss to Wales in Cardiff. The loss against Warren Gatland’s side was the second for the Boks in four test matches in Europe. Despite that, Coetzee’s Springbok dream job got off to a bad start.  Last year led the team to their worst ever record, losing eight times in 12 Test matches. His woes continued when the Boks were demolished 57-0 by the NewZealand back in September. READ: Was Coetzee always doomed to fail? On Saturday fans once again took their frustrations out on the coach following a loss that was highlighted by costly errors. There's also speculation that Coetzee and his assistant, Matt Proudfoot, are in talks with Japanese side Canon Eagles. Coetzee could be dismissed in his upcoming performance review. . eNCA

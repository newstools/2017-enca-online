JOHANNESBURG - Just two days after Cyril Ramaphosa took the reins of the ANC, Cosatu is calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down. The federation's Bheki Ntshalintshali was addressing striking Shoprite workers in Johannesburg on Friday. According to Ntshalintshali, they believe the face of the ANC in the 2019 general election should be that of the leader of the governing party.

"Comrade JZ must be able to step down graciously so that comrade CR is able to occupy the space to take over," said Ntshalintshali.  "We cannot have two centres of power ... We have one president and the president of the African National Congress is comrade Cyril Ramaphosa." Zuma himself is on record as saying he believes the president of the ANC should be the president of the country. He was speaking during an interview on iGagasi FM in KwaZulu-Natal in August last year. eNCA

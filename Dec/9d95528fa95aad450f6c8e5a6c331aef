CAPE TOWN - The water crisis in the Western Cape has impacted negatively on the stadiums used by the Premier Soccer League clubs. We had booked an alternate venue called Athlone Stadium with full knowledge and acceptance of the 7s event. However Athlone was not maintained and the PSL has now condemned it as unplayable. The league has had to close down a total of 13 venues as they do not meet the minimum requirements of the PSL.

The Cape Town stadium has been booked for rugby, concerts and various other activities. As a result, Athlone stadium has been used this season by all five teams in Cape Town and this overuse has resulted in the grass dying. As from Friday, the Athlone stadium will be closed to allow for the treatment and recovery of the pitch and installation of supply pipes.

The updated fixtures with new venues will be sporadically communicated on the PSL website and social media platforms.Â  African News Agency

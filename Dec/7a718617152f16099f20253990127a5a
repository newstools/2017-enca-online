JOHANNESBURG - ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says it’s all systems go for the party’s elective conference. He was speaking to the media during an inspection of the conference venue at Nasrec in southern Johannesburg. INFOGRAPHIC: How does voting work at the ANC conference? “All we do is to ensure that we physically inspect the venue of conference. We are happy the conference will go ahead as planned. The conference is going to be successful, it's not going to collapse. Those who predicted a collapse I'm sure they are disappointed already. They may try other tricks but the conference is on... it's going to be a proper ending of a conference,” said Mantashe. The 54th ANC elective conference kicks off on Saturday, 16 December 2017. eNCA

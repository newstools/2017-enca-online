JOHANNESBURG – Media reports have started circulating as to why outgoing Treasure General Zweli Mkhize declined his nomination. TimesLive reported on Saturday that Mkhize, who was nominated by 193 branches, struck a deal with Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza. EXPLAINER: What comes next in the ANC succession race? “TimesLIVE understands that Mkhize's backers had reached a similar deal with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa's camp – agreeing that he would decline nomination to allow Lindiwe Sisulu to contest the position under their slate,” the site reported. It further reported that “senior ANC figures familiar with the discussions between Mkhize‚ Mabuza and the supporters of presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma‚ they were due to lobby for Mkhize to be their number one candidate on the incoming National Executive Committee of the party‚ which is its highest decision-making body in between conferences.” eNCA

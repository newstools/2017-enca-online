JOHANNESBURG - Just over 100 people have been arrested for drinking and driving in the areas around Durban since last week. Durban Metro Police spokesman Sibonelo Mchunu said on Saturday: "As we stand now we have detained over 105 people in the last week. That sends the message to people that drinking and driving is not allowed. We hope that people are going to listen and hope that they will abide by the rules of the road.  READ: 13 injured in head-on Durban car, taxi crash "The other problem is fatigue as well as overloading and unroadworthy cars. We make sure that we are doing a lot of enforcement within our municipal borders so that people are compliant with the rules of the road before they arrive in the city. Mchunu said about 300 metro officers a day -- and even more at night -- were being deployed in and around Durban over the festive season. More than a million holidaymakers are expected to visit the city over the next few weeks.

JOHANNESBURG - Keep those raincoats, umbrellas and wellies handy. A steady influx of tropical moisture and an unstable atmosphere will bring more thunderstorms this week. The South African Weather Service has warned of heavy rain (50mm or more over 24 hours) for Gauteng, northern and eastern Free State, southwestern Limpopo, eastern and southern Mpumalanga, and the western and central parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Localised flooding is also possible in these areas. The eNCA weather department’s weather models indicate more than 75mm of rain accumulating in Gauteng during Tuesday and Wednesday, and more than 100mm of rain over parts of KZN and Mpumalanga over the 48-hour period. Cloudy and wet weather will continue for the eastern half of South Africa on Wednesday. The heavy rain will ease up by Thursday, but with normal isolated afternoon and evening thunderstorm activity returning to the forecast by Friday. eNCA

CAPE TOWN – Seabelo Senatla was the toast of the Cape Town Stadium as he ran in a hat-trick in the Blitzboks’ comfortable 40-5 victory over Russia in their Cape Town Sevens opener on Saturday. On a blustery but sunny day in the Mother City, the South Africans got the ball rolling immediately from the kickoff in what was an electric atmosphere at the former 2010 Fifa World Cup venue. The tall Tim Agaba won back the Blitzboks’ own start, and the ball was quickly moved wide for Senatla to open the scoring. Branco du Preez soon added a second after good work by Werner Kok at the breakdown, which led to Cecil Afrika sending Du Preez through a gap with a pop pass. READ: Blitzboks can't be imitated The match was virtually over as a contest after five minutes when Senatla showed off his fancy footwork for his second touchdown, and when he wrapped up his hat-trick in the eighth minute, he moved to 199 World Sevens Series tries in his career. Russia only threatened the Blitzboks once, when Du Preez missed a tackle on Roman Rushchin, who scored the only points for the visitors. Agaba and Rosko Specman rounded off the scoring for the Blitzboks, who will take on France next at 4.10pm SA time. Scorers:
	South Africa 40 (26) – Tries: Seabelo Senatla (3), Branco du Preez, Tim Agaba, Rosko Specman. Conversions: Du Preez (3), Cecil Afrika (1), Justin Geduld (1).
	Russia 5 (5) – Try: Roman Roshchin.  African News Agency

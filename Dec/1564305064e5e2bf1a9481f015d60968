JOHANNESBURG - An eight-foot bronze statue of Usain Bolt was unveiled at Jamaica’s National Stadium in Kingston over the weekend. The statue, sculpted by Basil Watson, shows Bolt in his trademark ‘to the world’ stance. The Jamaican sprinter, who retired after the IAAF World Championships London 2017, was at the ceremony to show his appreciation for the statue. “Never did I feel that I would be in this moment, as big as it is now, among statues at the National Stadium where it all began,” said Bolt, winner of six individual Olympic gold medals and seven individual world titles. “This is why I always encourage everybody. Anything is possible, no limits. Because at no point in time did I ever think I would achieve this much, but I’ve always pushed on and stayed focused on what I want.” In a video message during the ceremony, IAAF president Sebastian Coe acknowledged the impact Bolt has had on athletics.

JOHANNESBURG - Deputy secretary-general of the ANC Jesse Duarte briefed the media on the credentials that have been adopted for the ANC's national conference. The credentials were adopted on Sunday morning, more than 20 hours later than scheduled. Duarte said the delay was due to the outcome of several court cases. She reiterated that the PEC's of KZN and the Free State -- who are not branch delegates -- will not be voting. A total of 35 branches of North West were also disqualified. The number delegates at the conference stand at 4,776. To win the election, a candidate needs 2,389 votes.  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - With just 10 days left before Africa's most famous Mixed Martial Artist, Dricus du Plessis, faces Borys Mankowski in Poland for the KSW middleweight title, The Clinch learns live in the studio that he is withdrawing, having suffered torn hand ligaments in fight camp. In this exclusive episode, Du Plessis addresses Mankowski and the KSW fans and talks about his return from injury and plans in 2018. We also speak to Borys Mankowski all the way from Poznań in Poland about his thoughts on the fight, which will be rebooked for early March. This episode was recorded before the injury announcement but was embargoed so that KSW could rearrange its commitments. It is a must-watch for KSW and Stillknocks fans.  eNCA

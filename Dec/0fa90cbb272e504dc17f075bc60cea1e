MUMBAI - Sri Lanka scored 135 for seven after being put into bat in the third and final Twenty20 international against India in Mumbai on Sunday. The visitors suffered from a lack of partnerships but Asela Gunaratne (36) and Dasun Shanaka (29 not out) gave some respectability to the total against a disciplined Indian attack. Pacemen Jaydev Unadkat and Hardik Pandya claimed two wickets each. India is looking to complete a series sweep after taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in Cuttack. AFP

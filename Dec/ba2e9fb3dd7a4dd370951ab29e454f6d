PRETORIA - The appointment of Shaun Abrahams as the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) was unlawful and must be set aside.  That was the finding of a full bench of the North Gauteng High Court on Friday.  Civil society organisations had approached the court to have the R17-million golden handshake received by Abrahams' predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, declared invalid.  Nxasana has claimed he was forced by President Jacob Zuma to resign. Zuma has denied this.  The former NPA has since said he is willing to pay back the settlement and return to his position.  Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said Nxasana's resignation was procured by the promise of unlawful rewards. The judges said it "would not be just" to reinstate Nxasana or to allow Abrahams to remain. The court determined that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa now has 60 days to appoint a new NDPP. eNCA

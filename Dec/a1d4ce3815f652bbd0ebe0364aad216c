JOHANNESBURG - Heineken will open a $100-million (R1.36-billion) brewery in Mozambique, its first production facility in the country, the brewer said on Monday. The world's second-largest brewer plans to start production at the 0.8-million-hectolitres-capacity plant in the capital, Maputo, in the first half of 2019, it said in a statement. Heineken, which also brews Amstel and Sagres, opened a marketing office in Mozambique last year, importing products to compete in a market in which AB Inbev's 2M is entrenched.

"We are delighted to enter Mozambique, where we see promising long-term economic perspectives," said Heineken's managing director for East and West Africa, Boudewijn Haarsma. Heineken built a brewery in South Africa less than a decade ago after ending a deal with SABMiller for brewing Amstel beer. Reuters

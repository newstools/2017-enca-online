JOHANNESBURG - The ANC steering committee called an urgent meeting for Tuesday morning. In the last 24 hours, issues have been raised around vote counting which impacted the allocation of positions in the top six. The Race: Some FS ANC members unhappy with Magashule According to former national spokesperson for the African National Congress, Jackson Mthembu, "68 votes that were not included in the report of the Electoral Commission at Plenary which, when included, will change the numbers of Comrade Senzo (SG) drastically and positively. "It has been discovered that 63 votes for Senzo were not counted, for South Coast, Far North Region and one region in Limpopo. This matter will be discussed now to conference and a recount has been requested." According to reports, the 63 were registered as voting delegates but  discovered that their names were not on the voters roll when they went to vote. They were allowed to vote, but their votes were kept aside pending a decision of the Steering Committee. That decision was never taken. They were all allegedly Cyril Ramaphosa supporters. Their votes would potentially change the outcome of the secretary general election.  eNCA will  add further details as soon as they are available. eNCA

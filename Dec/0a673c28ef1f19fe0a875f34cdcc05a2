JOHANNESBURG - Analyst Fikile Bili says nobody is secure at the ANC elective conference, which kicks off at Nasrec, Johannesburg, on Saturday.  READ: ANC elective conference in numbers According to Bili, the police are not visible enough at the venue and he fears what could happen if people do not accept the outcome of the conference. Bili says the standard of registration was very poor in that there were attempts to register fake delegates. He also says he has spoken to delegates who have admitted to not being legitimate. Some ANC members from the North West are disputing the legitimacy of delegates sent to represent them at the national elective conference. They claim provincial leaders manipulated the process to influence the outcome. eNCA

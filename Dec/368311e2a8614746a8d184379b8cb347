JOHANNESBURG – A good samaritan taxi driver, who was on his way to Cape Town when stopped and picked up two lost children along the N2 freeway, has been hailed by Western Cape police as a hero. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut on Tuesday said: “Compassion is not what many taxi drivers are known for, but it was quick thinking by Mbulelo Mngqenge. Realising the imminent danger the children were facing, he stopped and took them to Mowbray Police Station”.

With the help of local social workers, the police made contact with their family. Police have since reunited the four-year-old boy with his family. The 14-year-old girl has been taken to Groote Schuur Hospital for observation. The colonel said in a province where the safety of children “remains a sore point” the taxi driver’s actions were to be commended.

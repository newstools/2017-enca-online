KWAZULU-NATAL - The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal has accused the country’s judges of trying to determine the outcome of the party’s elective conference. The league says the judiciary is attempting a silent overthrow of President Jacob Zuma, and is trying to change the constitution via the back door. “These judges must stay in their lane,” says Thanduxolo Sabela, KZN ANCYL secretary. WATCH: Zuma application to set aside State Capture report dismissed with costs Another day, another sharp criticism for the country’s judiciary. On a day when an under-siege President Jacob Zuma lost two court battles, his staunch defenders, the ANCYL in KwaZulu-Natal, slammed the country’s judges. “The judiciary must come out of ANC politics. That’s why we are saying it’s judicial overreach. If you look at these latest judgments, they have a clear intention of trying to influence the outcomes of the national conference, which is about to begin over the weekend. We are very clear, it’s going to happen. We are the delegates, we are not going to be influenced by some judge seated somewhere with deep hatred for radical economic transformation,” Sabela says. The league says it will advocate for the manual counting of votes at this weekend’s national elective conference. eNCA

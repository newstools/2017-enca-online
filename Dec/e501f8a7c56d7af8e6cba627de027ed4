JOHANNESBURG – South African disc jockey Tlou Cleopas Monyepao, known as Dj Cleo, has pulled out of the Afropunk Music Festival in Johannesburg. Cleo took to twitter on Friday to announce that he will no longer be playing at the event citing lack of respect during the booking process. “I won’t be playing at @afropunk anymore. I choose to be respectful in how I voice this tweet even thought there was none during the booking process.,” reads the Dj’s tweet. Cleo is the second artist to pull out of the event in the past two days. US musician Solange Knowles pulled out of the event on Thursday, announcing through her Instagram account that she was being treated for a medical condition that she was diagnosed with five months ago. “The past five months I have been quietly treating, and working through an Autonomic Disorder. It's been a journey that hasn’t been easy on me,” she said in the post. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The issue of monopoly capital will again feature on the agenda at the African National Conference (ANC)'s 54th national elective conference. The event, which will see the party elect its new top six leadership, gets underway in Johannesburg on Saturday. The ANC's internal discussion on monopoly capital is far from over. The chair of the party's subcommittee on political education says it would be disingenuous not to debate what the concept fully entails. “The phenomenon and the concept itself is an anti-thesis of what the movement stands for. Even if tomorrow SA develops or whatever happens and you have black monopoly capital, that would still not be in sync with what the ANC stands for. It's disingenuous to not describe what we are faced with because if you don't do that, you are confusing people,” Nathi Mthetwa said. He says it is incorrect and misguided to attribute the concept of white monopoly capital to now-defunct public relations agency Bell Pottinger. The Strategy and Tactics document was presented at the policy conference in June. Now provinces will give their input before it is adopted at the national conference. eNCA

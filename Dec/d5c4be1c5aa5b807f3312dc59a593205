JOHANNESBURG - ANC presidential hopeful Zweli Mkhize says the North Gauteng High Court ruling on the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) should be respected. Mkhize was campaigning in Soweto on Sunday. On Friday, a full bench declared Shaun Abrahams' appointment as national director of public prosecutions invalid and set it aside. WATCH: Hands off state, Dlamini tells judges Civil society organisations had approached the court to have the R17-million golden handshake received by Abrahams' predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana, declared invalid. Nxasana has claimed he was forced by President Jacob Zuma to resign. Zuma has denied this. Nxasana has since said he is willing to pay back the settlement and return to his position. eNCA

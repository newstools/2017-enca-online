Ease the amount of waste going to the landfill, this festive season by wrapping your gifts in repurposed items in the following ways:  1. Put your stamp on your wrapping: one of the simplest ways to save money and make the most of paper you might discard is to make it into wrapping paper using stamps. This kind of wrapping can be made with plain office cartridge paper, the unused side of scrap paper, or even junk mail. 2. Get into the kitchen: some of the items from your kitchen can be easily converted to make decorations for your gifts, including aluminium and baking paper. 3. Put a bow on it: gift ribbons don't have to be expensive to be beautiful and making one out of magazine paper is easy with a plethora of YouTube tutorials to lead you to crafty proficiency. 4. Wrap it in another gift: one great way to make a gift extra special is to wrap it in another present. A hand-knitted scarf, a beautiful tablecloth or runner, and a hand-made purse or similar items are all great things to use for wrapping a gift within a gift. 5. Make your paper a puzzle: free word-search-creation websites are common enough that printing a large word search on some cartridge paper takes less than five minutes.

JOHANNESBURG - David Makhura, the Gauteng ANC deputy chair, has explained what happened to the almost 70 votes that were previously unaccounted for. It has emerged the members registered as voting delegates went to vote only to discover that their names were not on the voters' roll. WATCH: The ANC announces its new leaders "There are either 68 or 63 comrades who are valid delegates that attended but didn’t appear on the voters' roll. They decided they must vote separately and their votes will be counted. The steering committee needs to make a decision, but that had not been done. They are sealed, set aside and those votes have not been added to the numbers that were delivered to us yesterday [on Monday],” says Makhura. It is believed that the 60-something delegates support Cyril Ramaphosa's slate and their votes would change the secretary-general's post. On Monday, Senzo Mchunu narrowly lost to Ace Magashule to become the secretary-general. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The Constitutional Court on Friday ruled that the language policy implemented by the University of the Free State (UFS) is legal and valid. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng delivered the majority judgment in the Johannesburg court. Lobby groups, including AfriForum, approached the highest court to challenge the UFS’s decision to change the primary medium of instruction from Afrikaans and English to just English, with groups saying the move would be unconstitutional. "The university’s language policy was determined and is subject to and thus consistent with the ministerial policy framework and the Constitution of the republic. Its adoption is lawful and valid,” Mogoeng said. CJ Mogoeng now addresses the historical and socio-political context at the #UFS by asking rhetorical questions about what the university would be expected to do by reasonable observers given what did in fact happen in the public gaze at the Bloemfontein campus over years. CJ Mogoeng cites the #UFS officials' view that dual medium of instruction was neither fair nor feasible, & did not remedy apartheid laws & practices, & risked violated #Constitutional compulsions, & policy is not reasonably practicable. eNCA

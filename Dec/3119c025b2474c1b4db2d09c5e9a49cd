The SABC expressed its gratitude to all managers and staff members “who kept the ship afloat” during the protest action. Their efforts were well appreciated as they helped the SABC deliver on its mandate to the “millions of South Africans who rely on SABC radio and television services to be well informed on various societal matters”, the statement said.

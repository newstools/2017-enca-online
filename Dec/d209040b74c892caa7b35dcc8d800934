JOHANNESBURG â€“ Centuries by Wesley Barresi and Ben Cooper helped the Netherlands ease to an eight-wicket win over Namibia on Wednesday, and strengthen its position at the top of the ICC World Cricket League Championship table with 20 points. The victory also ensured Netherlands the 13th spot in the One-Day International League. After being asked to bat in Dubai, a collective effort from its batting department guided Namibia to 269/8 in 50 overs. In reply, the Netherlands rode on a 236-run association between Barresi (120 off 127) and Cooper (109* off 111) to finish on 270/2 in 41.1 overs. Namibia lost Stephan Baard (1) in the second over, but a 74-run stand for the second wicket between Louis van der Westhuizen (54 off 61) and Zane Green (34 off 53), the wicketkeeper-batsman, brought the Sarel Burger-led side back on track. Roelof van der Merwe, the left-arm spinner, scalped three wickets in the space of eight overs to reduce Namibia to 115/4. But a late boost from Gerhard Erasmus (52 off 62), JP Kotze (48 off 41) and Burger (29* off 23) propelled Namibia to a competitive total. While van der Merwe picked up 3/54, Pieter Seelaar (2/42) and Vivian Kingma (2/14) claimed two wickets each. For Netherlands, Barresi and Cooper took charge after the early departure of Stephan Myburgh (0). The duo scored at a good pace and kept the run-rate in check. The partnership was finally broken in the 37th over when Bernard Scholtz dismissed Barresi. During his knock, Barresi smacked 11 fours and a six. Having lost his partner, Cooper, who blasted 15 fours and two sixes, completed the job with some help from Peter Borren (16*). African News Agency

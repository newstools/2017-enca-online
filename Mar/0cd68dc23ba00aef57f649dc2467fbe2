PARIS - The French artist who spent a week entombed inside a rock began an even more bizarre feat Wednesday -- sitting on a dozen eggs until they hatch. [TODAY] Abraham Poincheval starts his new performance " uf" at @PalaisdeTokyo! It will last until the eggs' hatch.. #contemporaryart #paris pic.twitter.com/3e1svFijIG Abraham Poincheval aims to become a "human hen" by sitting and laying on the eggs inside a glass vitrine at a Paris modern art museum until the chicks emerge.The performance, called "Egg", could last three to four weeks, with the artist getting only a half-hour break every 24 hours to keep him from cracking.He is also on a special diet rich in ginger so he can keep the eggs at a minimum of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit).Poincheval, 44, made headlines earlier this month after declaring his seven days inside a rock a mind-altering "trip".READ: 'It's like tripping': French artist entombed in rockThis time, however, he looked distinctly ill at ease as he stepped into the vitrine in the Palais de Tokyo museum in his socks.He quickly wrapped himself in a heavy traditional Korean cape and sat on a "laying table" specially designed to stop him from accidentally crushing the eggs.While Poincheval described his time inside the limestone rock as blissful, he acknowledged that sitting on the eggs for such a long time had him worried."I have never been so directly exposed to the public before. Usually, I am inside something. But every performance is a first," he told AFP.No 'hen-men' will be eatenHis father Christian acknowledged that it was a test of his mental strength, with the usually amiable Poincheval avoiding eye contact with the crowds gathered around the glass case."He is going into himself," his father said, describing the experience of observing his son through the vitrine as "like watching him on TV". partir d aujourd hui #AbrahamPoincheval couve des ufs, nuits et jours, jusqu leur closion --https://t.co/s3ydXJBNPz pic.twitter.com/i4QVPl0ea1 He revealed that when Poincheval was a child he had a pet chicken, and promised that any "hen-men and hen-women" his son brings into the world will be allowed to live out their natural lives on his smallholding in the west of France."I have prepared everything to welcome the chicks including a luxury chicken coop. I can assure you that they will never be the centerpiece of a grand feast," said Christian Poincheval, an inventor best known for pills that make flatulence smell of roses and even chocolate.He saw the performance as a meditation on "the cycles of life. The cycle from egg to chick takes roughly 21 to 26 days, which correspondents almost to a woman's (menstrual) cycle."His son had said earlier that he was inspired by a tragicomic short story by the French writer Guy de Maupassant.In "Toine", a bad-tempered farmer's wife gets revenge on her idle bon vivant husband by using his body to keep her chickens' eggs warm when he is paralysed by a mysterious malady."Being inside the rock didn't bother me at all," he added."Normally there is a moment when your anxiety mounts, but with the rock that didn't happen. I was almost anxious about not being anxious," he said.After talking to geologists, he put that down to the "extreme calmness" of the limestone."I learned it had been laid down gently, layer by layer, over thousands of years, and had never been tormented."Monkey KingEven though the rock is also egg-shaped, Poincheval said the two performances were not directly linked.When he emerged from the rock, however, Chinese students told him the story of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King who was born from a stone egg.Often described as France's most extreme artist, Poincheval is no stranger to bizarre performances.

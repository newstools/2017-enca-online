It will hold a congress next month to ratify the new name.The congress will be attended by 21 unions, representing nearly 700,000 members.Vavi said the new trade union federation would be free from political influence and would aim to fill the vacuum left after Cosatu expelled Numsa in November 2015, and other unions left.READ: Vavi heads new trade union This is about the casualised workers who have no voice, who are going through tremendous levels of super exploitation from their bosses, he said.Vavi said there was no trade union movement presently fighting for the rights of many ordinary workers.

JOHANNESBURG - Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba says President Jacob Zuma's dismissal of the stellar team at the Finance Ministry constitutes an assault on the poor of South Africa."Who stands to lose when we can't raise foreign investment to finance growth in our country? The poor. Who stands to lose when interest rates on the money we already owe gobbles up our nation's resources? The poor.READ: Rand takes biggest weekly dive since 2015"Who stands to gain when corrupt elites enrich themselves on the side while doing deals worth billions of rands with state-owned enterprises? The people of suburbs like Saxonwold," Makgoba said in a statement on Friday."Ignorance can be educated but there is no cure for recklessness. The president's decisions are a frightening example of a leader who has continually shown his profound indifference to the economic health of South Africa. It is telling that he failed to secure agreement to this reckless move even from within his own party and the ruling alliance."Makgoba said he hoped the ANC would reflect on how they were "betraying the hopes of our people"."Civil society too will have to consider for how long we stand by helplessly and watch the gains of our democracy destroyed," Makgoba said.eNCA

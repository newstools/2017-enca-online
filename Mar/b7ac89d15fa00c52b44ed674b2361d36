CAPE TOWN - Since cycling season is in full force, I thought I d share some helpful tips for those supporting loved ones as they sweat across kilometres that we don t have the courage to conquer.1. RISE AND SHINE!Make sure you get there extra early, find a spot to camp out and keep the coffee on standby.Cheerleading from 5am is no child s play. Spectator spots can be found on the Cape Cycle Tour website.2. WARMTH = COMFORTCape Town summer days are a thing of the past. Chilly mornings and later sunrises might make you feel a bit groggy, but nothing a blanket and an extra jacket can t solve.Don t ditch the sunscreen altogether though, Cape Town sun is sneaky.3. SAVE WATER, SAVE ENERGY As you re well aware, Cape Town has been experiencing a shortage of water. Make sure you ve got enough bottles of water for both you and cyclists who might look a bit dehydrated on the way. Padkos is definitely a must. Keep in mind, most spectator spots aren t braai friendly, so having a hearty breakfast before leaving might be a good idea.4. GET SNAPPING!Whether it s selfies, action shots of your loved ones passing by or even Snapchat videos, get your photography skills on and capture the moment.I mean, it is the 40th annual Cycle Tour after all. And like they say it didn t happen unless there s a selfie of you there.5. GO TEAM, GO!Lastly, and most importantly -- make sure you have your placards and pom poms ready. If there s one thing these cyclists need, it s your cheering, your support and your positive energy!eNCA

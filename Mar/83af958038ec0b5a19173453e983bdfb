JOHANNESBURG - The JSE closed weaker on Friday as banks retreated on downgrade fears following President Jacob Zuma s axing of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister.General retailers financials and property stocks were also under pressure for most of the day on foreign selling.Gold stocks jumped on a weaker rand despite the gold price being only mildly positive. Resources were higher on the weaker local currency.Since foreigners owned almost 40% of the total value of JSE s listed shares selling by them negatively affected all equity investors including South African pension and provident funds which held the retirement savings of the nation the Association for Savings and Investment SA (Asisa) said in a note.A loss in investor confidence led to a sell-off in bonds and a much weaker rand Asisa said.Ashburton Investments strategy head Mark Appleton said the appointment of Malusi Gigaba as finance minister was unlikely to be seen in a positive light by investors. It adds considerable uncertainty to the fiscal outlook. He said credit rating agencies would likely see the move as a threat to the strength of SA s institutions and heightened the probability of an earlier than expected downgrade Appleton said.Credit Rating Agency Fitch has warned that the axing of Pravin Gordhan had increased the likelihood that the government s sovereign credit rating would take a knock.In a statement released on Friday Fitch said the cabinet reshuffle signalled a change in policy direction and would raise political tension potentially weakening public finances and standards of governance.Banks failed to come back despite indications of groundswell support for Gordhan and indications that a campaign against Zuma s actions was set to grow. This included a vote of no confidence in Parliament next week and the view of deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa that Gordhan s removal was unacceptable .Although the rand was 0.81% weaker at R13.3723/$ in late afternoon trade analysts said it was performing in a more stable manner when compared to the period that immediately followed the axing of Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015.Capital Economics economist John Ashbourne said the damage for the economy s near-term prospects may be smaller than some feared.

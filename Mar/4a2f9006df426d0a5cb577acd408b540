SOWETO Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates played to a 1-1 draw in their riveting Premiership match at the FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon.South Africa s biggest derby has not always lived up to the hype in recent years, but this was a game that did not disappoint the capacity crowd of more than 90,000 people were treated to a spectacle of end-to-end attacking football throughout the afternoon.And while Steve Komphela s Chiefs side, with 16 points from their last five games, had gone in as favourites against a Buccaneers team with a new coach at the helm in Kjell Jonevret and winless in nine matches, the derby, as is often the case, proved to be a great leveller and there was very little to separate the two old foes on the day.The match got off to a blistering start and it was a fired-up Pirates side who had the first opportunities, but Dove Wome was twice denied by Itumeleng Khune.Despite having put Chiefs under siege, Bucs found themselves a goal down in the 16th minute when Siphiwe Tshabalala released Bernard Parker down the left, who in turn provided a square ball for a simple tap-in for former Pirates winger Joseph Molangoane..@KaizerChiefs take the LEAD against @Orlando_Pirates in the #SowetoDerby!

Edmore Chirambadare went a whisker away from picking out the top corner for Chiefs, and then Willard Katsande headed wide at the back post, before Lorch sent a rising drive into the stands.The game remained on a knife-edge as both teams pushed and probed for openings, but with little success as the two sets of defenders did their jobs.Then with 10 minutes remaining, Amakhosi were awarded a soft penalty when Molangoane s cross hit Ayanda Gcaba s arm and a penalty was awarded. Willard Katsande had to wait an awful long time to take the spot kick and seemed to lose his nerve, a weak effort allowing Mhlongo to make a good, but not overly difficult save.@BwMhlongo saves @Orlando_Pirates a point in the #SowetoDerby ---- pic.twitter.com/n5dKU4aFG7Erick Mathoho squandered another chance to seal victory for Chiefs when his looping header dropped inches wide of the target in added time.But the draw was a fair result of a match which lived up to expectations and saw both sides playing their part in a thrilling encounter.African News Agency

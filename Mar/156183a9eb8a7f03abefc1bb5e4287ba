At that time the rand shed 150c immediately and 250c within a month.READ: Rand reaches record low as Nene replaced as finance ministerCairns said the best scenario for the day was for the rand to stabilise above R12.50/$ within a 30-cent range the worst case scenario would be a Cabinet reshuffle.At 11.30am the rand was at R12.9766 to the dollar from a previous close of R12.7616.

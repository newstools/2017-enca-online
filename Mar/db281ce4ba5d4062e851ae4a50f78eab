MIDRAND - The ANC is refusing to comment on SACP revelations that President Jacob Zuma is using what appears to be a phoney intelligence report to justify the removal of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan from his cabinet. ANC Treasurer, Zweli Mkhize, has been in Midrand for an ANC progressive business forum event on construction.READ: ANC mum on cabinet reshuffleMkhize says a stable economy is vital to ensuring a competitive and growing construction sector, but he would not be drawn into commenting on moves against the finance minister. Let me say, when you have a reshuffle, you will need to wait for the government statement. Then the ANC can only comment on that after that," Mkhize said in answer to a question on whether or not the Top Six had prevented a reshuffle.President Jacob Zuma, meanwhile, has again laughed off questions about a possible cabinet reshuffle, after being quizzed by reporters as he left parliament earlier on Thursday. eNCA

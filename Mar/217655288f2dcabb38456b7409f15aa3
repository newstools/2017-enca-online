NEW YORK - The world of the senior citizen is often no comedy, but veteran actors Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Alan Arkin have combined comedy and social commentary in their new film "Going in Style" about a group of elderly bank robbers.The remake of the 1979 movie of the same name centres around three senior citizens who decide to rob a bank when they have their pensions taken away from them."This is a little deeper than most comedies you'll see", said Caine at the film's world premiere.WATCH: 'Game of Thrones' trailer offers glimpse at new seasonDirector Zach Braff agreed: "How can you make a movie about seniors in 2017 without discussing some of the social issues we all know that everyone, not just seniors, are facing in this country?""Pensions are disappearing because companies are going overseas, the healthcare debate, predatory lending from the banks, these are all things that are big issues for a lot of people in this country, and especially seniors"."It's fun to see the three of them get together and decide we're going to change things for ourselves and take action, however futile it might be", said co-star Christopher Lloyd.READ: Paramount rolls out big guns at CinemaConWhen asked about US President Donald Trump, Caine professed finding him interesting."Well he's not boring on television, is he?", Caine said."I mean I'm an Englishman and I wake up every morning and I turn on CNN to see what he's done.""Going in Style" hits US theatres April 7.AFP

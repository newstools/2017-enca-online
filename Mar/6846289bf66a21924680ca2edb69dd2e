Kick-off at the Stadium is 19h30.Although the Bulls can boast with a great record against the Bloemfontein franchise (15 wins in 17 games), the Free Staters showed they will be a tough nut to crack this year in their encounter with the Lions, who managed to snatch a narrow win over them last weekend.However, the Cheetahs received a blow with the news that wing Sergeal Petersen will be out for between four and six weeks with a knee injury, which he suffered in last Saturday s 28-25 home loss to the Lions.Earlier on Saturday afternoon, the high-riding Stormers will welcome the Jaguares to Newlands for their 17h15 clash. #CHEvBUL the Vodacom Bulls team to face the @CheetahsRugby in Bloem #SuperRugby pic.twitter.com/JojXxA7RtN The @CheetahsRugby are world leaders - fans will now be able to enter the Toyota Stadium and buy a beer at the #rugby using a bar code pic.twitter.com/UBx6HUxZbjRobbie Fleck, the coach of the men from Cape Town, has included Senatla on the bench for this match.In 2014 and 2015, the sevens superstar played in six Super Rugby matches.READ: Bulls lock De Jager to miss Super Rugby clash against CheetahsThe Capetonians will no doubt be buoyed by their good performance last weekend when they defeated the Bulls at the same venue, scoring five tries in the process.

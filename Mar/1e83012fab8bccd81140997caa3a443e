 JOHANNESBURG A group of Nashville university choir students gave Memphis restaurant patrons an unexpected show with their dinner by singing a South African hymn.The group sang Hlonolofatsa , which is a traditional South African hymn. We had an awesome time, representative Jeffery Ames was quoted as saying by WMCActionNews5.com.According to the website, Ames said the hymn, arranged by Daniel Jackson and made popular by the Soweto Gospel Choir of South Africa, roughly translates to Bless Everything in the name of the Father. The beauty of the music is that it transcends race, creed, or ethnicities, Ames added. With 'Hlonolofatsa,' it was a really special opportunity to speak blessings over one another. eNCA

PRETORIA - Political analyst Karima Brown says Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini spoke about the crisis in her department for more than an hour and told the country "absolutely nothing".Dlamini called a media conference in Pretoria on Sunday but refused to answer key questions. "At this stage the minister is behaving as if she's doing the country a favour. What she doesn't understand is that while she serves at the pleasure of the president because he appoints ministers, the president serves at the pleasure of the people, they are obligated to give South Africans a clear concise answer," Brown said."What is more shocking is that the minister and her spokesperson, Lumka Oliphant, ended up in squabbles and arguments with journalists, instead of providing the country with straightforward direct answers which (is what) they are supposed to be doing,' said Brown."The minister is an elected official appointed by the president. She's there to serve the people of South Africa. She must answer these questions. Seventeen million people's lives depend on this. Her behaviour was absolutely shocking.""The minister is hell-bent of fighting with everybody inside her department and Treasury ...who wants her to act lawfully," Brown said.

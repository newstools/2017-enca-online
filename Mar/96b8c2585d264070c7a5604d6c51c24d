MADRID Barcelona suffered a hangover from their remarkable Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain as Alex Bergantinos's winner 16 minutes from time handed Deportivo la Coruna a famous 2-1 win on Sunday.Joselu had fired Deportivo into a first-half lead before Luis Suarez levelled in the first minute of the second period.However, Bergantinos rose highest from a corner to seal Deportivo's first victory over Barcelona since 2008.Barca still lead Real Madrid by one point at the top of La Liga, but the European champions now have two games in hand and can go top with victory over Real Betis later on Sunday.Barcelona boss Luis Enrique made five changes from the side that beat PSG 6-1 on Wednesday to produce the biggest comeback in Champions League history from a 4-0 first leg deficit.Two-goal hero in midweek Neymar was one of those to miss out due to an abductor injury.However, Barca still had plenty of firepower available with Suarez alongside Lionel Messi up front and Suarez had the first big chance when he headed straight at German Lux.It took Deportivo 40 minutes to force Marc-Andre ter Stegen into a serious save as the German leapt to his left to brilliantly turn Joselu's volley behind. @LuisSuarez9: "We have things to improve, but there's a lot of league left."

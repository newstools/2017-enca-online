CAPE TOWN The visiting Stormers held out for a bonus-point 41-10 win over the Southern Kings in a Super Rugby match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, Port Elizabeth, on Saturday afternoon.Towards the end of the match, the Stormers bonus point was under threat but five minutes from the end Kings old boy, fullback SP Marais turned the tables on his former province and sent debutant Justin Phillips in for the insurance try, although two minutes later, centre EW Viljoen was over for the team s sixth try.Up to this stage, the final result was never in the balance but the Stormers bonus point was and in the end, the scoreline did not reflect the ability of the Kings to keep the Stormers on a tight rein with a glut of turnovers.The Kings were full of fight at the start and managed to retain ball possession on their early forays which the Stormers were forced to keep in check. Lionel Cronj , the Kings pivot, made his side s early efforts count with a 4th-minute penalty (3-0).The Stormers power showed at the first scrum in the match as they were able to dispossess the Kings halfback, Rick Schroeder. They looked impressive on the ensuing attack as they made their way to the tryline but Kings flanker Chris Cloete saved the day with a turn-over, three metres out.

He held on to a feed close to the halfway line and shrug off several tackles before crossing the whitewash in the 15th minute. Flyhalf Robert du Preez fluffed his conversion attempt (5-3).On the half-hour mark, Leyds was in the picture again when he sparked a counter-attack deep inside his own half. Eighthman Nizaam Carr and outside centre Dan du Plessis joined the fray further upfield before Stormers debutant Bjorn Basson rounded off at the corner flag. Du Preez goaled splendidly to push the scoreline out to 12-3.READ: Siya Kolisi named Stormers captainBy this time, the Stormers upped their intensity as they used their bullocking pack to take the ball up and the Kings defence leaked the next try wide out where flank Rynhardt Elstadt crossed for an unconverted try in the 35th minute (17-3).The Stormers left a try out on the field when they failed to score in the final minute of the first half after they were turned over yet again, virtually on the tryline.A mere three minutes into the second half the Stormers power up front took its toll again and this time the backline used the ball to good effect as they punched holes into the Kings defence for Du Preez crossed for a converted try (24-3). Congratulations to @TheStormers on a right royal win over the Kings! #ShowYourStripes pic.twitter.com/FKowHUQxa3 With this five-pointer, the chances of a bonus-point win was looking good for the Stormers. The early second-half score may have been a telltale sign that the Stormers would be running away with the game but once they made several substitutions, they seemed to lose their thrust and complacency seemed to creep into their ranks.A 55th-minute grubber from Cronj on the Stormers 22m line landed in no man s land and Kings rightwing Makazole Mapimpi was up in a flash to gather and canter in unchallenged for a try. Cronj converted to reduce the deficit (24-10).After Du Preez snapped over a 55th-minute penalty to give the Stormers a 27-10 lead, the Kings showed a fresh sense of urgency and threatened briefly but they were unable to breach the opposition defence.All that the Stormers needed to do was sit on their bonus-point lead and their cover defence came to the rescue when the Kings came close to scoring at the corner flag.Thereafter Marais contrived a bit of magic at his old stomping ground and the bonus-point issue was put beyond doubt when he sent Phillips in for the side s fifth try.Viljoen followed suit two minutes later with the Stormers sixth try.African News Agency

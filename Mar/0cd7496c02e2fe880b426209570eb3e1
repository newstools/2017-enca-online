JOHANNESBURG - Investec expects higher full-year revenue and operating profit as a recovery in equity markets boosted the company's asset management and wealth and investment units.The bank also said it expects its specialist banking businesses to report better results for the year ending 31 March than the previous year, helped by the UK unit."The UK economy has been performing better than initially expected, but the possibility of a hard Brexit continues to create uncertainty and could have an impact on overall levels of economic growth," the company said.Investec, which is being investigated along with more than a dozen other banks for colluding to rig the rand, said it had not yet received relevant information on the precise allegations against it.Investec said last month that the Competition Commission's case against the bank was confined to the conduct of a single trader.Reuters

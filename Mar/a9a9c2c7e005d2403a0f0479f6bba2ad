JOHANNESBURG - The South African bond market was weaker on Wednesday morning taking its cue from the rand which is under pressure due to speculation about an imminent Cabinet reshuffle.The Business Day reported on Wednesday that it had reliably learnt that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were on their way out of Cabinet.Nedbank analysts said that given the significant support for the rand over the past 15 months in the face of deteriorating economic and political fundamentals it was likely that some support for the rand would materialise if the political noise eased.The rand was at R13.07/$ from Tuesday s close of R12.99 and bonds usually track the rand.The analysts said confirmation of a Cabinet reshuffle was likely to lead to a negative reaction from credit ratings agencies.As long as the focus remained on the saga between the Gordhan and Zuma liquidity in the foreign exchange markets would be limited at best and price action was likely to be erratic and extreme the analysts said.At 9.01am the bid on the R186 was at 8.87% from Tuesday s 8.73% and that of the R207 at 7.85% from 7.73%.iNet Bridge

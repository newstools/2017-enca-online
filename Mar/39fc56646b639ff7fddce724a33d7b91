 JOHANNESBURG A man and his mother were robbed by panga-wielding thieves hours after being in South Africa.Tony Densem, 28, and his mother Jean, 58, were attacked outside a filling station in Polokwane.The attack was caught on video camera. It happened last week Thursday at around 3am. We had just boarded off the bus from Zimbabwe and we couldn t find transport. We also tried to book into a lodge but it was too expensive, so we walked to a petrol station, where we thought it was safe, said Densem.Densem said there was a silver Toyota Avanza and the guys offered to transport them to look for accommodation but they didn't succeed in finding one as it too expensive. They locked doors and all the windows were closed. My mother was beginning to worry and I was nervous as well. We asked them to drop us off back at the petrol station and they wanted more money but we didn t give them, he said.Densem said he felt safe for a while at the petrol station until the robbers attacked his mother with a panga and fled off with R6, 300.He fought the panga-wielding man. I fought him off until I got the money back but then I dislocated my knee and couldn t run off, so the attacker started hitting me with the knife on my knees, said Densem. My mother suffered a few bruises but I think she suffered psychologically, added Densem.Densem said he suffered an injury to his knee and had 8 stitches.A case has been opened with police. The police said they will come to interview us but that hasn t happened. We are still waiting. eNCA

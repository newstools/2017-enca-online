PARLIAMENT - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan confirmed on Tuesday that his department was weighing an application for a deviation from public finance rules to allow a short-term contract with Cash Paymaster Services to pay welfare grants, but questioned the ethics of the company and its partners.Chief among these were the selling or sharing of details of millions of grant recipients and the possibility that Grindrod Bank, which plays a key role in how many of those access their money, was earning interest on welfare funds.READ: CPS must make no profit from Sassa deal: Freedom Under LawGordhan told Parliament s Standing Committee on Public Accounts that it had come to National Treasury s attention while it studied the current payment model, that some R11 billion in grant funding spent an average of five days a month in Grindrod s accounts. I m not saying they are earning interest, but it is something we should look into because it would be interest on public money, he said.Director General of Finance, Lungisa Fuzile, told the African News Agency (ANA) that the department was already inquiring into this possibility.Gordhan was briefing Scopa on National Treasury s involvement in warding off a welfare pay-out crisis at the end of the month when the current contract between CPS and the South African Social Security Agency runs out.READ: Gordhan confident grants will be paid on 1 AprilThe issue has been handed over to a ministerial task team that was appointed last week and, according to Gordhan, has met three times already.This came after Sassa in February submitted a request to National Treasury for a deviation from public finance management rules to allow an extension of the contract with CPS.Treasury rejected it on the basis that the contract was in 2013 found by the Constitutional Court to be invalid, and said it could therefore only give permission if the court agreed to further extend a suspension of its invalidity ruling.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini nonetheless proceeded to negotiate with CPS for a new term, and struck an agreement in principle.The team of ministers, which groups herself, Gordhan and five other Cabinet ministers, at the weekend decided to wipe that off the table and allow negotiations to start afresh only once the approval of National Treasury for a new contract, as opposed to an extension, had been secured.Gordhan made plain that the decision was not his, but in the hands of procurement officers at National Treasury.He suggested, however, that should the relevant rules not allow a deviation, the court could be approached to enable a deal that would prevent grant beneficiaries going empty-handed next month. The first point we want to make is that we must as soon as possible relieve the uncertainty and assure the recipients that on the first of April they will receive their grants, the minister said. It is ours to ensure that our higher duty is carried out. He added that where the public finance framework might be constraining, then we have to get the courts to agree with us .But he stressed that a deal with CPS would be for a short period and that government must devise another means of grant payment.He said National Treasury became aware in October 2016 that there were serious doubts that Sassa would be able to take over grant payment this year.In the meanwhile, documents filed to the Constitutional Court by Sassa late on Monday, painted a picture of chaos behind the scenes after the agency s executive committee realised in January 2016 that it may be impossible to take over grant payment in April.The submission states that Dlamini only became aware of the problem in October, but that both she and Sassa conceded that they should have appreciated the situation earlier. It also suggests that Sassa and Dlamini did not see eye to eye on handling the problem and that, despite official denials, the agency began discussions with CPS on a possible extension last year.The court document further reveals that CPS s holding company, Net 1, had suggested to Sassa a year ago that it would not be able to take over grant administration and should renew its contract with its subsidiary for at least 12 months.It was filed at the orders of Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng who on Tuesday issued a further directive to the minister and the agency to explain why they missed the deadline of 4pm by several hours.He asked for an explanation by 3pm on Tuesday, but was again kept waiting as lawyers for the parties arrived at the court an hour late.Scopa chairman Themba Godi was scathing of Dlamini s conduct, accusing her of deliberately seeking to prolong a parasitic relationship with CPS. Is it not the problem, the political hand in the administration? And if that is the case, is it not the minister that should be held accountable and not (Sassa CEO Thembinkosi) Magwaza? Gordhan said it was not for him to pass political comment on the conduct of Dlamini, who has been lambasted for allowing a crisis to develop and side-stepping National Treasury and the Constitutional Court to negotiate with CPS.He cautioned, however, that procurement became fraught when political considerations came into play, and said National Treasury found itself drawn into a difficult narrative when it had to intervene to stop wrongdoing. We get into this sloganeering contain Treasury, take over Treasury. You have all heard it, and I don t think it is child s play at the end of the day. Asked by journalists after the briefing how he coped with the political pressure he described, Gordhan replied: I am still standing. African News Agency

NEW YORK - Kendrick Lamar, one of the most praised voices in hip-hop, took on both US President Donald Trump and rivals in the rap world in a surprise new song.The California rapper ended the track by throwing out the date April 7 - leading fans to expect more music, and perhaps even his next album, on that date.Lamar late Thursday dropped "The Heart Part 4," a nearly five-minute track of rapid-fire rhyme that, in contrast to his often eclectic musical influences, is led by an unadorned bass line.The Grammy-winning artist - whose 2015 album "To Pimp a Butterfly" was quickly hailed as a classic - paints a bleak picture on his latest track, rapping: "The whole world goin' mad.""Donald Trump is a chump / Know how we feel, punk / Tell 'em that God comin' / And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to something," he raps, referring to the Trump presidential campaign's alleged ties with Russia.READ: Trumpcare or Obamacare: Make-or-break vote for presidentLamar also points to Trump's failure to win the popular vote in last year's election, rapping: "America's truth ain't ignoring the votes."Lamar has been an active social commentator.His "Alright" became an unofficial anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement, while another "To Pimp a Butterfly" track - "How Much a Dollar Cost," about an encounter with a beggar in South Africa - was hailed by then-president Barack Obama as his favorite song of 2015.More unusually for the 29-year-old Lamar, much of "The Heart Part 4" is about boasting of his own status in hip-hop."30 millions later, my future favours / The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior," he raps, exalting both his earnings and his skill.READ: Kendrick Lamar surprises fans, debuts at number oneIn several cryptic verses in the song, Lamar appears to take shots at other rappers - especially Drake, the Toronto superstar, whom he suggests is overrated."The Heart Part 4" is loosely inspired by funk legend James Brown's "Don't Tell a Lie About Me and I Won't Tell the Truth On You," off his 1974 double-album "Hell."If Lamar releases new music on April 7, it would come little more than a week before he is one of the headliners of Coachella, the premier music festival in California.AFP

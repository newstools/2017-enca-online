JOHANNESBURG Outgoing Prasa Chairperson, Popo Molefe says ousted board members are preparing to file court papers to challenge their dismissals.They want to stop the appointment of an interim board by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters.READ: Prasa board dissolvedThe axed board members gave the minister until yesterday to provide them with reasons for the dismissals. "We received a response at about 1.03pm yesterday, but it was not a response giving the reasons, neither was it an undertaking to desist from appointing an interim board. It was a reply that said to give them until Tuesday because the minister is busy," Molefe said."We wrote a second letter giving them until 7pm because in our view, when she took this decision to dissolve the board, she must have considered it. So she should be able to give reasons and she doesn't need extra time to do so."We did indicate that if she's unable to give reasons, she should at least make an undertaking that she won't appoint an interim board. And we indicated that if she fails to give that undertaking we'll launch an urgent application today, and that is what we are busy with now." eNCA

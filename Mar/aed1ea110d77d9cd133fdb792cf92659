UNITED STATES - New research is teasing out more of the profoundly miraculous process of language learning in babies. And it turns out that even more is going on prenatally than previously suspected.By looking at international adoptees babies who were adopted soon after birth and who grow up hearing a different language than what they heard in the womb researchers can see how what babies hear before and soon after birth affects how they perceive sounds, giving new meaning to the idea of a birth language. Experts have known for some time that newborns prefer to listen to voices speaking the language that they ve been listening to in the womb, said Anne Cutler, a psycholinguist who is a professor at the Marcs Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development at Western Sydney University, in Australia.Newborns can recognize the voices they ve been hearing for the last trimester in the womb, especially the sounds that come from their mothers, and prefer those voices to the voices of strangers.They also prefer other languages with similar rhythms, rather than languages with very different rhythms. (Newborns indicated their preferences by how long they sucked on specially rigged pacifiers that enabled them to hear one speaker versus another, or one language versus another.)Dr. Cutler said the thinking used to be that babies didn t actually learn phonemes the smallest units of sound that make up words and language, that distinguish one word from another, as in bag and tag until the second six months of life.But new research, including the recent adoptee study, is challenging that notion.- PERRI KLASS, MD - New York Times -eNCA

Hundreds have been killed on both sides of the insurgency.The Sinai Province has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks in North Sinai.The militant group, which originated in Sinai, last year pledged allegiance to the IS and its leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi.Meanwhile, an Egyptian court on Sunday sentenced 56 people to jail sentences, ranging from two to 13 years, over a 2016 migrant boat capsizing off Egypt s Mediterranean coast which left approximately 200 people dead.The convicted defendants, who can still appeal their sentences, were found guilty of manslaughter, negligence, endangering lives, and using an unlicensed vessel with inadequate rescue equipment.The boat, with several hundred people on board from a variety of different countries, was heading from the Egyptian port city of Rosetta to Italy when it capsized 12 kilometres off the Egyptian coast.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi ratified a law in November last year aimed at curbing irregular migration and cracking down on human smuggling.Those involved in smuggling the migrants, or helping broker the smuggling, are sentenced to jail terms. The migrants are not prosecuted.According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 5,000 migrants are thought to have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2016, a record figure the organisation described as a devastating milestone .African News Agency

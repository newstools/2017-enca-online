JOHANNESBURG - The expansion of the Gautrain network will need significant funding from various sources and affordability issues would be discussed with the national government Gauteng roads and transport MEC Ismail Vadi said on Wednesday.A feasibility study on the extension has been submitted to the provincial and national treasuries and major stakeholders that were consulted during the process. This project gives access to private sector funds locally and internationally as well as opportunities for innovation and world-best-practice during design construction operations and maintenance he said.READ: Gautrain sets plans on Soweto and Mamelodi routes It will also have significant socioeconomic development benefits including an estimated 211 000 jobs created in construction; R19bn procurement spend on black owned entities; increased black ownership of companies in the rail sector; a strong focus on local content in the supply chain; and increased capacity in the rail sector through skills development. Gauteng Premier David Makhura announced the expansion of the Gautrain service during his state of the province address last week.Vadi giving more detail said a feasibility study concluded that the extension of the network would provide significant economic and transport-related benefits for the province and the country.A KPMG study on the wider benefits of the Gautrain showed that between 2006 and 2011 more than 122 000 jobs were created and that for every R1 spent on the high-speed train R1.72 had been added to the Gauteng economy.Vadi said demand modelling was done to determine Gauteng s transport needs in 2025 and 2037. Through the modelling process it became clear that the cost of doing nothing in the province would be major road congestion in 2037 at which stage cars will travel at an average of 15km/h due to doubling of car growth. The feasibility study identified the main links and stations for the Gauteng extension which were: On the link between Jabulani via Cosmo City and Samrand to Mamelodi stations include Roodepoort Little Falls Fourways Sunninghill Olievenhoutsbosch Irene Tshwane East and Hazeldean. The link between Sandton and Cosmo City will have a station at Randburg. On the link between Rhodesfield and Boksburg there will be a station at East Rand Mall and a possible link-up with the OR Tambo International Airport Midfield terminal development. A link from Cosmo City to Lanseria Airport might be built.Vadi said because of the magnitude and complexity of the project it would be split into five phases.iNet Bridge

LONDON - Alexis Sanchez was named in Arsenal's starting XI for Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second leg at home to Bayern Munich following reports of a training-ground bust-up.The Chile star, 28, was dropped for Arsenal's 3-1 loss at Liverpool last Saturday after reportedly clashing with team-mates, but manager Arsene Wenger called the reports "completely false".Sanchez was due to replace Olivier Giroud up front, but the French striker was brought back into the team after Danny Welbeck succumbed to illness in the warm-up at the Emirates Stadium.Beaten 5-1 by Bayern in the first leg, Arsenal would have to make history to go through -- no team in the Champions League has ever turned around a four-goal deficit.Wenger made three further changes to the side beaten by Liverpool, with goalkeeper David Ospina, Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott replacing Petr Cech, Francis Coquelin and Alex Iwobi.Mesut Ozil was only fit enough for a place on the bench after a period of illness.Bayern were missing suspended captain Philipp Lahm, but coach Carlo Ancelotti named an otherwise full-strength team.Rafinha deputised for Lahm at right-back, with Thiago Alcantara chosen ahead of Thomas Mueller to support lone striker Robert Lewandowski.TeamsArsenal (4-2-3-1): David Ospina; Hector Bellerin, Shkodran Mustafi, Laurent Koscielny (capt), Nacho Monreal; Aaron Ramsey, Granit Xhaka; Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Welbeck; Alexis SanchezManager: Arsene Wenger (FRA)Bayern Munich (4-2-3-1): Manuel Neuer (capt); Rafinha, Mats Hummels, Javi Martinez, David Alaba; Xabi Alonso, Arturo Vidal; Arjen Robben, Thiago Alcantara, Franck Ribery; Robert LewandowskiManager: Carlo Ancelotti (ITA)Referee: Tasos Sidiropoulos (GRE)AFP

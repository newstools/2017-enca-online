LONDON - Yorkshire paceman Jack Brooks is set to miss the start of the new English season, his county announced Monday.Brooks sustained a calf injury during Yorkshire's pre-season tour of Dubai and could be out of action for up to six weeks, which would rule him out of three first-class County Championship matches and five one-day fixtures.The 32-year-old Brooks is not the only injury concern Yorkshire have among their fast bowlers.Veteran left-armer Ryan Sidebottom, set to retire at the end of the season, is struggling with a hamstring problem and current England international Liam Plunkett withdrew from the ongoing curtain-raiser between MCC and Middlesex with a calf problem."Jack Brooks came out early with the physio and has unfortunately picked up a calf injury, so we're looking at four to six weeks on him depending upon how quickly he recovers," Yorkshire first-team coach Andrew Gale told the club's website. #Yorkshire suffer @BrooksyFerret injury blowhttps://t.co/YQ0mjtlFFd#YCCC @YorkshireCCC pic.twitter.com/XtR2QgN4tr"Ryan Sidebottom's just got a tight hamstring, so we're unsure how long that's going to be at this stage," he added. "Liam Plunkett is coming back to Dubai. He's got a slight calf problem, and we'll assess that tomorrow."Brooks took 60 Championship wickets last season as Yorkshire, bidding for a hat-trick of titles, finished third after losing a thrilling title-deciding finale against eventual champions Middlesex at Lord's in what was former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie's final match as coach of the White Rose county.

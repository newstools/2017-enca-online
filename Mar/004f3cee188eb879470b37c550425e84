HAMILTON - A rejuvenated Tom Latham ensured a positive start to New Zealand's reply after Quinton de Kock bolstered South Africa with a defiant 90 on another wet day in the third Test in Hamilton.When bad light ended play four overs early on Sunday, New Zealand were 67 without loss in reply to South Africa's 314. Stumps on day two with the BLACKCAPS 67-0 in response to South Africa's 314.

Smart fielding When he went to the middle with the fall of Temba Bavuma's wicket, South Africa were 148 for five and he held the innings together while the bottom half of the batting order added a further 166.De Kock's 90 came off only 118 balls, highlighting why captain Faf du Plessis was determined to have him play despite the wicketkeeper-batsman suffering ligament damage to his right index finger.He hit 11 fours and two huge sixes, one off New Zealand's best performed bowler Matt Henry and one off Jeetan Patel, as he dominated the off-spinner who had claimed his wicket cheaply in the drawn first Test.READ: De Kock declared fit after pressure from skipperBut 10 runs short of his century he played across the line to Neil Wagner and was out lbw.South Africa resumed the day at 123 for four and after Henry removed Bavuma for 29, du Plessis progressed to 53 before a smart piece of fielding by Latham at short leg.On the third ball of Mitch Santner's opening over, Latham anticipated du Plessis was going to sweep and before the shot was played he was moving to his right where he flung out an arm to take the close-range catch.Latham took another classy catch, just above ground level to his right at second slip to remove Vernon Philander for 11 off Henry.Henry equalled his career best figures with four for 93, while Neil Wagner, who took three for an expensive 104, ended the South Africa innings with the wicket of the hard-hitting Kagiso Rabada who scored 34 off 31 deliveries. End of the SA innings as Rabada goes after getting to a career-best 34. Wagner with the final wicket. De Kock top-scorer 90 #NZvSA pic.twitter.com/RnL4bdkkklAFP

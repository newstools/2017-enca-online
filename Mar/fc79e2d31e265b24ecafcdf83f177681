PARLIAMENT - The speaker of the National Assembly Baleka took a brief moment from Thursday's proceeding to extend an apology to IFP MP Mangosuthu Buthelezi.It appears that during the 2017 State of the Nation Address Mbete had referred to Buthelezi as "ikhehla", an isiZulu word that is commonly translated to "old man".Buthelezi had apparently taken offence and written to the speaker to correct the phrase.In a heartfelt exchange during the plenary sitting, Buthelezi took the opportunity to explain the origins of the word.Watch the exchange in the following videos eNCA

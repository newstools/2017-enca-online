JOHANNESBURG Judge Dennis Davis has denied making disparaging remarks about the South African Revenue Service (Sars).Davis says a City Press report on his comments was not completely true. The statement that they issued was... to a large degree... based on a City Press report which is not entirely accurate. I've actually tried to correct that by sending a letter to the editor of City Press."I never suggested that Sars was collapsing. I said, given the coverage on Sars, there are very disturbed public perceptions that Sars is in trouble. That s not our view, that's a view that s carried in the press almost daily and that is unfortunate."It (Sars) is a vitally important institution and I expressed concerns about these perceptions.

JOHANNESBURG As the deadline approaches, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) seems set to continue distributing social grants for another two years.While no legal contract is in place, an agreement has apparently been reached that will see CPS remaining responsible for 17 million grant payments, from April 1.Serge Belamant, CEO of Net1 the company that owns the CPS business unit clarified the two-year term of the contract to eNCA."The reason is because it took us approximately 14 months to re-register 10 million beneficiaries and we believe that it would take any new incumbent at least the fair amount of time.""Sassa wanted to ensure they are not going to come back in 20 months' time into a position where we have to enter into a new negotiation because a new contractor, even if such was appointed, was not yet ready to take over the payment contact from us," Belamant added. Further details around the new contract remain sketchy, and it's unclear if the irregularities from the current agreement have been addressed.Treasury was not involved in negotiations for the new social grant payment deal. "By staying on the outside they could be more objective once terms have been basically agreed upon and they could come back and give their views if the terms were reasonable or not," Belamant said.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini denies there is a crisis over social grant payments. She is confident beneficiaries will be paid by April, even though the new deal requires approval from Treasury.At a media briefing on Sunday, she refused to answer questions about the resignation of her director general, Zane Dangor just days after her department said it had reached an agreement to keep paying grants.WATCH: Minister Bathabile Dlamini scoffs at reporter's questionsThe Democratic Alliance, meanwhile, is set to proceed with its application to the Constitutional Court. It is seeking accountability for those who have failed to ensure Sassa s readiness to take over the distribution of grants, it said in a statement.In the statement released on Sunday, the DA said it was "both shocked and angered by the minister s failure to table a clear plan to resolve this crisis. If anything her unwillingness to provide clear answers, determination to blame the media, and refusal to explain the director general s resignation, provides the clearest indication yet as to why we are in this mess today."READ: DA distorted social grant reply: DlaminiThe party also called for President Jacob Zuma to be held accountable. "He has remained silent until the last possible minute and failed to fire Minister Dlamini the bare minimum he could do to show that he was equally concerned about grant recipients," the party stated.The DA will ask the court to find that Dlamini, the CEO of Sassa, and the grants organisation itself have violated their duties in terms of the constitution.The party has organised a mass march for Friday, March 10 in which they plan to "send a clear message to Minister Dlamini that her disdain for the poor will not be left unanswered".* Wits University Political Analyst, Susan Booysen has cast doubt on the legality of the new deal.

Freedman Plaza in Central Park and The Cooper Union college in the East Village, while some will be put up at bus shelters.The installations will be on view from October 12 to February 11, 2018.The Public Art Fund, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, is a nonprofit organisation that presents the work of contemporary artists in New York's public spaces.AFP

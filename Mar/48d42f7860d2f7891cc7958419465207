Madison Gardiner arrived home one day, and as usual, ran to open her front door.She had no idea what was about to happen next - something quite out of the ordinary for the little four-year-old girl.A massive gust of wind flung the door open, swinging her out with it as she bravely hung on with just one hand - the other hand gripping what appears to be a smart phone!She didn't drop it, nor let go of the door! And she actually came away unharmed.Watch the video above to see the action, and hear her Mum explain how she felt, as Madison showed off her muscles.YouTube

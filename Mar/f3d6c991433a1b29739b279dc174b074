JOHANNESBURG Members of the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (SACTWU) marched to Sars offices in Pretoria on Friday.The union says cheap clothes imported from China are killing the textile industry. The laws of the country must be respected. It cannot be free for all because once it gets to that point, then our industries will perish like what is currently happening. Sara is actually not denying that. When we handed over our memorandum they accepted that they're prepared to have meetings with us in the month of April. So there's no denial that there's been a slow down in terms of strengthening inspection mor especially in the biggest harbours, said SACTWU deputy general secretary Chris Gina. #SACTWU General Secretary Andre Kriel explaining what they are marching to #SARS today. pic.twitter.com/YMf6MJyTsJ #SACTWU says cheap clothes imported from China are killing the textile industry.

PRETORIA - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane is leading a march to the Department of Social Development in Pretoria.The party is expected to hand over a memorandum to the Minister of Social Development, Bathabile Dlamini, to demand that the new contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) be made public."The ANC and Dlamini have shown time and time again that there will be no accountability for this crisis and that is why the DA is left with no choice but to submit an application in terms of PAIA for the contract, in the interest of openness and transparency," the party said in a statement.The current invalid contract between Sassa and CPS will come to an end on 31 March."The 17 million South Africans who rely on social grants just to put the bare essentials on the table from day to day, deserve to know if and how their grants will be paid," said the statement.

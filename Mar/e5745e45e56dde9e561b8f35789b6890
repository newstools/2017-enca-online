JOHANNESBURG – Spur has reviewed its CCTV footage after an incident over the weekend. The company has confirmed that Ms Lebohang Mabuya’s version of events is accurate and that the aggressive male customer did indeed grab the child in her care. The incident was filmed at Texamo Spur at The Glen Shopping Centre in Johannesburg. Spur Corporation on Wednesday issued an “unequivocal apology” and offered counselling to Lebohang Mabuya and her family for the incident that took place on Sunday. This comes after an altercation between two parents involved inside the restaurant, and captured on cellphone video went viral on social media on Human Rights Day. In the footage, Mabuya was seen engaged in a heated exchange with an unidentified White man who threatened to “klap (smack)” her if she did not discipline her child. The incident, which included profanities, occurred in front of children and other patrons at Texamo Spur during the birthday party of Mabuya’s three-year-old goddaughter. Mabuya, a nurse by profession, justified her actions by saying that she was defending her child after the man manhandled her, though she admitted she was also not proud of the language she used in front of children, and apologised for this.

In a statement on Wednesday, Spur corroborated Mabuya’s version of events that the man had been aggressive towards her child. “We have reviewed our CCTV footage of the incident and can confirm that Ms Mabuya’s version of events is accurate; the footage shows that her child was grabbed by the male customer in an aggressive manner and his actions are unacceptable,” Spur said.  “We affirm our decision to ban the male customer from our stores, physical aggression towards our customers, particularly against women and children will not be tolerated. “We acknowledge that the staff and management of the store did not sufficiently assist Ms Mabuya. We have addressed this with the store management and we are reviewing our internal procedures to ensure that restaurant staff are better equipped to manage an incident such as this.

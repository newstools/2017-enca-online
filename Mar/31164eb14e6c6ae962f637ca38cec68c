Munchick said the forum for the drivers was formed last year after one of them was attacked, hijacked and killed while waiting at the airport. Our guys are beaten everyday, Uber says there s protection and security but there s none I can take you to Park Station now to see for yourself, she said. Drivers have been hijacked especially since the cash option was implemented people do not go look out for Uber, they can just order a taxi and attack the driver just like that. The Uber drivers action came around the same time as metered taxi drivers were blocking access to the OR Tambo International Airport in protests against rival Uber. As a result of the blockade motorists were stuck for hours along the R21, the surrounding N12 and R24.Metered taxi operators blocked the roads, accusing Uber of unfairly taking away market share because they do not have to register for operating licences.Metered taxi operators are also demanding that Uber, the ride sharing app service, be stopped from operating in South Africa.Meanwhile, Minister of Transport, Dipuo Peters condemned the actions of metered taxi drivers."It is unfortunate that some meter taxi operators will resort to anarchy, whilst the Department of Transport is in the process of responding to their memorandum in consultation with the leadership of the meter taxi associations and the relevant provincial authorities," she said in a statement.African News Agency

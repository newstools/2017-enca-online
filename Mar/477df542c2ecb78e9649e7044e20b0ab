JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has given an urgent instruction to Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, to return from an investor roadshow in the UK and US. 'President Jacob Zuma has instructed the Minister of Finance, Mr Pravin Gordhan and Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas to cancel the international investment promotion roadshow to the United Kingdom and the United States and return to South Africa immediately," the presidency issued a statement on Monday afternoon. The Daily Maverick reported that National Treasury received written authorisation from the Presidency to embark on the international investment promotion roadshow, but that the authorisation was later rescinded by the Presidency with no reason given. Zuma reportedly contacted Gordhan in London overnight, ahead of the UK leg of the roadshow which commences today (Monday). The US leg has already been cancelled. Gordhan and Jonas have said in the past that they are serving at the behest of President Jacob Zuma and only he can decide on their future. Their remarks come amid widespread speculation that their jobs may be on the line through a cabinet reshuffle.

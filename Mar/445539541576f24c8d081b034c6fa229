JOHANNESBURG Rebels from South Sudan have denied kidnapping eight local workers working with international charity Samaritan Purse from a village located about 680km northeast of the capital, Juba. We do not have any relation to this incident, a spokesperson for the Sudan People s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) rebels told the Sudan Tribune on Monday, adding: This is a mere rumour spread by the government. However, a spokesman for the government of President Salva Kiir s Sudan People s Liberation Movement (SPLM), Lul Ruai Koang, stated that armed opposition forces had kidnapped the aid workers and demanded aid deliveries as ransom . The rebels attacked and abducted eight local staff from Samaritan s Purse and they are being held to ransom. They have demanded that the organisation takes aid to them, he said.Samaritan Purse acknowledged the kidnapping, which comes only days after rebels kidnapped two Indian engineers working for an oil company.READ: Sudan rebels release 125 prisonersThe continued threat posed to aid workers in the world s newest nation is likely to undermine humanitarian efforts in a country where over 100,000 people are on the verge of starvation and five million more than 40 percent of the population, is in urgent need of food assistance.South Sudan s civil war, which began in December 2013, continued in 2016 with serious abuses against civilians by both government forces and opposition fighters despite a peace agreement signed in August 2015, Human Rights Watch (HRW) recently reported in its 2017 world report.Government soldiers killed, raped and tortured civilians as well as destroying and pillaging civilian property during counter-insurgency operations in the southern and western parts of the country, and both sides committed abuses against civilians in and around Juba and other areas.Tens of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced in the country s worst ever violence since it seceded from North Sudan in 2011.An additional 200,000 people were forced to flee their homes, bringing the total displaced to 2.4 million. Those left behind, including people with disabilities, have faced serious abuses, said HRW.The economy of South Sudan is one of the world s weakest and most underdeveloped, with little existing infrastructure and the highest maternal mortality and female illiteracy rates in the world as of 2011.It is also one of the poorest countries in the world. Most villages in the country have no electricity or running water, and the country s overall infrastructure is lacking, with few paved roads.African News Agency

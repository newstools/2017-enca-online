LAS VEGAS - The Springbok Sevens team feel their recent success comes down to a belief in their structures.The series win in Las Vegas proved to be a tough one, with the Blitzboks having to come from behind a few times. I must admit this was one of the most difficult tournaments we had to play so far this season. The guys played really well when needed and they showed a lot of character and you can t fault the guys for their effort. They played their hearts out, so hats off to the guys, and hats off to the management for keeping the guys fresh, said Springbok Sevens captain Phillip Snyman.All Honour and Glory to the Most High for His blessing on us. I'm grateful to my team mates, management, and supporters#LasVegas7s pic.twitter.com/XRw63rqE5WMeanwhile, Springbok Sevens star Rosko Specman has been included in the Dream Team for the Las Vegas Sevens.Specman was the catalyst of the Blitzboks 19-12 victory over Olympic champions Fiji in the absence of World Sevens Player of the Year Seabelo Senatla and stalwart Kwagga Smith, who are part of the Stormers and Lions Super Rugby squads respectively.The speedster from Grahamstown scored five tries at the Sam Boyd Stadium to be joint-third on the try-scorers list, and produced an unbelievable solo touchdown in the final as he carved through and around the Fijian defence.Yet despite the Blitzboks title triumph, their fourth of the season in five events, Specman was the only South African picked in the Dream Team for the Las Vegas tournament.- Additional reporting ANAREACTION: @Blitzboks head coach @Neil5Powell on his side's win against Fiji at the #USA7s pic.twitter.com/GB6HAl75pbeNCA

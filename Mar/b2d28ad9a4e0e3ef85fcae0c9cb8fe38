TOKYO - The euro firmed to one-month highs against the dollar in Asian trading on Monday, after some European Central Bank policymakers raised the possibility of hiking interest rates before bond purchases end.The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.0699, after rising as high as $1.0701, its highest level since 9 February.Some members of the ECB's governing council discussed the possibility of higher interest rates at last week's policy meeting, but talk on the issue was brief and did not receive broad support, said two sources familiar with the discussion.The euro's gains were limited by expectations that the US Federal Reserve would decide to raise interest rates at its two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday, after US employers hired workers at a robust pace in February.The headline figure surpassed expectations and wages also rose, though by less than some economists expected. Overall, the non-farm payrolls report reinforced market expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates this week despite slowing economic growth.READ: Euro slips to 5-day low as investors eye ECB meetingWage growth rose 0.2 percent, falling short of an expected 0.3 percent increase, which caused US Treasury yields to recede from last week's 12-week highs.The benchmark 10-year US yield was last at 2.580 percent in Asian trading, compared with its US close on Friday of 2.582 percent.

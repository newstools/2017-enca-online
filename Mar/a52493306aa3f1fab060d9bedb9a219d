MIAMI A French and an American astronaut floated outside the International Space Station Friday for a spacewalk to upgrade the orbiting outpost for the arrival of future space crews.The spacewalk by France's Thomas Pesquet, 39, and American Shane Kimbrough, 49, officially began at 7:24 am (1124 GMT) when the duo switched their spacesuits to internal battery power.Pesquet and Kimbrough worked separately as they prepared to install new docking ports for the next generation of commercial spacecraft and do some minor space station repairs and maintenance.The new crew spaceships, being designed by SpaceX and Boeing, should begin flying astronauts to the station in the coming years, as early as 2018. All scheduled tasks for today s #spacewalk have been completed. @Space_Station astronauts begin cleaning up.

Just like you have to replace lights in your home, @Space_Station needs maintenance too.

The robotic arm is guided toward @Thom_Astro by @AstroPeggy from inside @Space_Station.

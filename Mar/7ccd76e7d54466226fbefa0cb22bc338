More than 1.8 million more customers now used its app to bank.Capitec bolstered its branch base by opening 76 new stores, mostly in higher-end shopping centres.Fourie said this in no way mean it was no longer "the people s bank". It s still in line with our philosophy to offer simplistic banking to all South Africans, he said.The country s third-largest bank had taken a first step towards global expansion, investing more than R290-million on a 40 percent stake in European online consumer lender Cream Finance. We saw this as a ... very nice opportunity to learn internationally to understand the lending market in different countries. They currently operate in six countries and they ve identified a possible 30 countries to go into," said Fourie. "We are building as digital-banking platform and maybe [in the] long term one can put that together as a new banking proposition to the client." eNCA

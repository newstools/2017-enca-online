JOHANNESBURG The Social Security Agency of SA (Sassa) has withdrawn its Constitutional Court application asking it to extend a social grants distribution contract. The reason for the withdrawal is that we are waiting for input from one stakeholder, once that's done we will relodge the application, said Sassa spokesperson, Kgomoco Diseko.Diseko couldn't tell when the agency would relodge.READ: Grants crisis before parliamentary watchdogOn Tuesday, Sassa launched an urgent application with the Constitutional Court asking it to extended its contract with the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for another year.The same court ruled in 2014 that the contract was unlawful, and ordered the department to replace CPS by the first of April this year.But President Jacob Zuma has said he's confident social grant beneficiaries will be paid next month. I've said no pensioner must not earn on that day. And I think whether it's court or whatever, we've got to do whatever we can to ensure that pensioners get their pay, and this is what I have been promised. And I've got reports that indicated they are working to sort out the problem, and I'm hoping they will because it would be a little irresponsible not to deal with the issue when we knew as it was coming, that it was coming, Zuma said.eNCA

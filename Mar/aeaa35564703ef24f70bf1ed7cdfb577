BARCELONA - Barcelona boss Luis Enrique put his faith in Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar to produce a historic Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain in what could be his last European game in charge on Wednesday.Barca need to do what no side has ever done in the Champions League by overturning a 4-0 first-leg deficit, to make the quarter-finals for a 10th straight season.Enrique, who announced his decision to step down at the end of the season last week, makes three changes from the side that started their humiliation in Paris three weeks ago and he also switches to a 3-4-3 formation.Javier Mascherano, Ivan Rakitic and Rafinha replace Sergi Roberto, Jordi Alba and Andre Gomes with Messi likely to start as the most attacking point of a midfield diamond.PSG boss Unai Emery makes two changes from the first leg as he eyes a first win at the Camp Nou in 12 attempts as a visiting coach.Captain Thiago Silva returns at the heart of the defence in place of Presnel Kimpembe, whilst injury means two-goal hero from the first leg Angel Di Maria misses out at the expense of Lucas Moura.Barcelona (3-4-3): Marc-Andre ter Stegen; Javier Mascherano, Gerard Pique, Samuel Umtiti; Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta (capt), Ivan Rakitic, Lionel Messi; Rafinha, Luis Suarez, NeymarCoach: Luis Enrique (ESP)Paris Saint-Germain (4-3-3): Kevin Trapp; Thomas Meunier, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva (capt), Layvin Kurzawa; Marco Verratti, Adrien Rabiot, Blaise Matuidi; Lucas Moura, Edinson Cavani, Julian DraxlerCoach: Unai Emery (ESP)Referee: Deniz Aytekin (GER) eNCA

We educate young ones, with special emphasis on the girl-child, on how to appropriately manage financial resources, Nwogugu said. We distribute materials to several of the pupils teaching them about the importance of saving for rainy days. She said that more than 30 successful women, from various spheres of life, had volunteered to support the workshop as part of International Women s Day celebrations. We are happy to have different successful volunteers as supporters because it is not every day these pupils get to see people that inspire them to succeed in life, she said.Amaka Agbakoba-Onyejianya, an entrepreneur, commended JAN for the initiative, saying a lot of people do not know how to spend within their means of income". Meanwhile, empowering these children with the knowledge will help them become financially independent, she said.Ifemena Oji, a managing partner at Haldane law firm, said that reaching out to children at this tender age on financial literacy was important. Aside from that it establishes stability in their future when they know how to save and account for money, it will prepare them to handle precarious financial situations in future. A lot of people these days live from hand to mouth because they don t know how to manage their salaries properly, she said. So, we are trying to make sure this is not the case for the future generations. JAN is part of Junior Achievement Worldwide (JAWW) and has reached more than 660,000 students in more than 750 schools in 29 locations across the country, with the support of more than 2,000 volunteers and teachers.African News Agency

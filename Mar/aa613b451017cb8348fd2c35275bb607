JOHANNESBURG - The Portfolio Committee on Transport is gearing up to put the brakes on the Passenger Railway Agency board s actions.Various political parties lambasted them on Tuesday for the state of affairs at the parastatal.They promised to write to President Jacob Zuma to intervene if things don t improve at Prasa.Former PRASA acting CEO Collins Letsoalo is accused of giving himself a huge salary hike from R1.5-million to R5.9-million.It s this bickering that the portfolio committee said they ve had enough of. For me, there is really no truth in what has been said here. And I'm going to show you that the board was aware of what was happening where the matter is concerning my remuneration. So the interpretation is not mine, I've never ever calculated my salary nor have I ever asked for increment. It's sad Chair that when I walk around, I'm called Mr 350 percent," said Collins Letsoalo, former PRASA acting CEO.The board says not so. But there is a very interesting email that was written by Mr Letsoalo, where he threatened the Group Executive HR to say to him that you give me what Lucky Montana was earning, failing which I will actually deal with you, said Tefetso Phitsane, Prasa Board Member.But the committee was having none of it. We feel very abused by you board members because you were aware very well about what is happening about this thing the increment of the acting CEO," said Thilivhali Mulaudzi, EFF MP. We are going to write a letter to the minister and we will copy the president to say three years down the line you have shown nothing else but dispute after dispute where have you seen it that this is the fourth man he will probably last because you re in exit as the board, said Dikeledi Magadzi, Committee Chairperson.Board member Tefetso Phitsane, put the blame squarely on Transport Minister, Dipuo Peters. I said Minister please deal with the environment this is the situation this is what we must deal with and she promised she would assist in that regard and of course assistance never came, said Phitsane.The committee members said they wanted the minister to appear before them but she was booked off sick. eNCA

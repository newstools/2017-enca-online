We are all Uber drivers and partners gathered here. We gave them a memorandum three weeks ago, which they never responded to, and they refuse to speak to us, said Munchik. We planned to slow down traffic and block the road, but police have told us they will organise a meeting with Uber but then Uber has shut down its offices and put armed men at the door. Munchik claimed Uber has been collecting names of members of the forum and their vehicle registrations.She said forum members are being deactivated them from the Uber app. Our guys are bitten everyday, Uber says there s protection and security but there s none I can take you to Park Station now to see for yourself.

LOS ANGELES - Actor Alec Baldwin said that his impersonation of US President Donald Trump on NBC's sketch show "Saturday Night Live" has revived his "dead" comedy career after he wrapped up sitcom "30 Rock" in 2012."I didn't realise in the comedy terms that I was dead," Baldwin told Reuters on Monday when asked if he felt he was entering a new era with his comedy."Maybe I was in a coma ... now I'm waking up from a coma and now I'm ready to do some comedy."

As Trump! Oh God!"Viewer ratings have soared for "Saturday Night Live" since Baldwin started portraying Trump in a series of skits mocking the billionaire reality TV star-turned-politician as a dim-witted commander-in-chief with a short attention span, an oversized-ego and a Twitter addiction.Trump criticised the NBC show in December, calling it "totally unwatchable" and a "hit-job."

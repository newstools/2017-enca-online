It was worth noting that not all shops were visited due to the few health inspectors available for the raids. We are therefore pleading to the public to exercise vigilance when buying groceries, particularly for infants. We will, however, continue to roll-out this operation within the province to ensure that our communities are given value service for their money. No charges were laid against the shop owners pending the report from environmental health service inspectors, Nkwalase said.African News Agency

As the government, we are indeed saddened by the passing of baby Singakhala and we remain committed to supporting the family during these trying times, Mayathula-Khoza said. The department is in touch with Department of Health s Forensic Pathology Unit, so as to fast track the process and also for the body to be released for burial. We will also continue to support the family with counselling, burial, and any necessary support until the end. Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance spokesperson on social development, Refiloe Nt sekhe, said calls for assistance from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in wake of Baby Singalakha s death was an indictment of Mayathula-Khoza and were beyond ludicrous .Mayathula-Khoza had said on Wednesday, that the Gauteng government may be forced to resort to seeking assistance from the SANDF to resolve staff shortages at welfare care centres if the social workers strike continues.READ: Nehawu begins talks to end strike The death of six-month-old baby Singalakha Sonamazi, an avoidable tragedy, highlights the inability of Gauteng Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza to do her job, Nt sekhe said. The strike emphasised that MEC Mayathula-Khoza had not adequately prepared to ensure that the elderly, disabled and young placed in her care would be looked after while social workers were not on hand. Members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), who are employed by the Department of Social Development, are on strike across the country.They are demanding, among other things, the introduction of a rural allowance and the absorption of unemployed social workers on a permanent basis.The union and the department had an extensive negotiating meeting in Tshwane on Wednesday and Thursdays at the request of the department to table a response to the Nehawu memorandum of demands.African News Agency

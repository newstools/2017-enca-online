It s a concern when you have players injured but the good thing is that we have brought a good number of players with lots of quality so we will not rush these ones back. We had already said we are going to make changes so if the quartet doesn t recover on time for the match we are still covered. After the training session, we will have to check their status with the medical team and take it from there, said Bafana Bafana stand-in coach Owen da Gama.Tickets for the match are still available at Computicket, Shoprite as well as Shoprite Checkers outlets for R60 all round.African News Agency

There is a request for information, a request for more information, and this comes in instalments over the months. Why seven months was inadequate or insufficient within which to conduct that investigation, Vardospan lawyer, Arnold Subel enquired.Vardospan has, however, been accused of extraordinary arrogance by the regulatory authorities. ... As if the world revolves around Vardospan. As if the Minister of Finance and SARB must devote their entire energy to Vardospan and nothing else, Lawyer for SARB and Registrar of Bank, Gilbert Marcus retorted.Lawyers for the Finance Minister say the seven-month period is by no means slow. The ordinary process to get from nought to above 75 is four years at least with a separate regulatory decision at every stage of that process, said Lawyer for Finance Minister, Mathew Chaskalson.Vardospan claims the controversial Gupta family have nothing to do with this acquisition."Nowhere in that the register do I see any link or association with the Gupta family," said Vardospan Director, Hamza Farooqui."Again, if we were uncomfortable or had anything to hide we would not have taken the support to very public and open judicial process, he added. #Vardospan's Hamza Farooqui today said there was "a lot of political noise [from Treasury&SARB]" around their application to buy #HabibBank. pic.twitter.com/H6qd950S5D It s going to be an anxious few hours before Vardospan knows whether or not its application will be heard on an urgent basis. Should the company succeed, it ll then have to argue the merits of its case.The March 31 deadline is arguably a moot point now.eNCA

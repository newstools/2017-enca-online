JOHANNESBURG - State Security Minister David Mahlobo says the government is considering regulating social media in an effort to curb the proliferation of what he described as "false" information."The false narrative in the social media, it's one of the challenges that South Africa faces," Mahlobo said at a press conference in Pretoria on Sunday.Mahlobo acknowledged that such a move would probably draw a wave of criticism and fears of stifling human rights, but added that "even the best democracies ... regulate" social media."Regulation is the way to go," the 45-year-old minister said, adding that the planned measures would also go after misleading photoshopped images."We will actually be discussing how do we regulate it."The move to curb the spread of misinformation comes amid efforts by Facebook, Google, and a group of international media to stymie the spread of fake news.

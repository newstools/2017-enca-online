JOHANNESBURG - Durban's emergency services were out in force on Friday, responding to a large fire at a warehouse in the Jacobs area of Durban. Netcare 911 paramedics, the fire services, police and several emergency services "arrived at the scene and found the fire to be spreading through the warehouse. Within minutes the whole building was engulfed in flames," according to Netcare 911 media liaison Chris Botha. Botha said the heavy 40-50km south-westerly winds were making the firefighters work very difficult. He noted that two people who had sustained burns to their hands were treated at the scene before being transported to hospital. He cautioned Durban residents to close their windows as the winds were pushing the smoke into the Durban CBD. He said if the smoke gets too bad move, people should move to a smoke-free location.

Ethekwini EMS Chief Fire Officer, Enock Mchunu, said  "We are currently busy fighting the fire we are making steady progress but we are obviously having some difficulties on the premises. But yes we are still busy extinguishing the fire. We have not extinguished it completely." The warehouse was believed to contain large volumes of wax and polypropylene. Southcoast Road was closed off between the M7 and Bayhead Road. The cause of the fire is as yet unknown and will form part of a large investigation by the fire services. eNCA

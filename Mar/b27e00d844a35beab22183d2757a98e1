It is, therefore, evident that the NACH has yielded positive results, not only in terms of monetary value but also in terms of disciplinary action taken against perpetrators. The Public Service Commission (PSC), on behalf of the government, manages the NACH, which people can access by dialling 0800-701-701. Whistle blowers can call the NACH to report corruption without fear of victimisation as the hotline offers anonymity, the statement said. As at 31 January 2017, 18,778 cases were referred to government departments and feedback on 17,240 (92%) cases was received. Of the total number of cases referred, 16,947 (90%) cases were closed. The rate of financial disclosures among senior public servants had also increased, to 98 percent the biggest leap yet since the Financial Disclosure Framework was introduced. This is an increase of 16 percent in the submission rate as compared with 82 percent recorded during the previous financial year (2014/2015). The disclosure system would now also include middle managers, employees in the supply-chain management and those working in finance units, ethics officers as well as employees of the Office of the Public Service Commission who verify financial interests disclosed by Senior Management Services members , who would have to fill in disclosure forms every year between 1-30 April .African News Agency

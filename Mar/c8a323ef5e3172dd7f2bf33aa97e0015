DAVEL - Around 1,500 children in Mpumalanga are being prevented from attending school, by their own parents.The angry parents describe the school as a death trap.Eleven classrooms at Davel Primary, near Bethal in Mpumalanga, were damaged by a storm last year.Four months later, no repair work has been carried out despite assurances from Mpumalanga education officials. We have been talking to the parents, we have been advising them that already we are in a process of having a contractor on site to fix the school, because some of this can t happen overnight, said Mpumalanga Education spokesman Jasper Zwane.The department insists schooling can continue while the classrooms are being fixed, but families say they won t put their little ones at risk.When asked why this was not treated as an emergency situation, Zwane responded to eNCA: It was, we have taken a decision to discourage procurement of mobile classrooms because they are expensive, it s always better to fix the school, so as we speak we are hoping that a contractor will be at the school before the end of the week. Meanwhile, valuable schooling hours are being lost daily.* Watch the full video report in the gallery above.eNCA

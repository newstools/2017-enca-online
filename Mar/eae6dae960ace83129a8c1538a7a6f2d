They have always played attacking rugby, but now they attack with different lines, so they are quite unpredictable, coach Robert du Preez explained. What we can expect is a lot of attacking rugby which will keep us on our feet; it s quite a good challenge. The Cheetahs team is a strong outfit with some very exciting players who can bring anything to the party. With the two teams sitting in a similar position after last week where the Cheetahs lost to the Jaguares and the Sharks didn t perform as well as they wanted to Du Preez expects a huge match on Saturday, both teams with a point to prove. Both teams need to put in a big performance, we re expecting a huge performance from them, as well as one from us. We need to lift our standards.

PRETORIA President Jacob Zuma met with Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Friday to discuss the social grants issue.Zuma insisted grants would be paid, saying he has been reluctant to comment on the issue because people were behaving like "government missed making payments". My problem with that issue is that people are making judgement before the date, they are saying many things and I don t think it s right, just exciting the country, Zuma said.Zuma was speaking at the Union Buildings after his presidential co-coordinating council meeting with ministers, premiers and local government officials.READ: Country must calm down over Sassa issue: President ZumaHe said he had met with Dlamini and Gordhan, to discuss the social pension grants debacle.Dlamini, who appeared in Parliament on Tuesday before the standing committee on public accounts, admitted that she has yet to secure the approval of Treasury to sign a new contract with Cash Paymaster Services.However, Zuma told the media that people should remain calm because grants will be definitely paid on April 1.The president said if grants were not paid, action would be taken against those responsible I think the country should be calm on this matter I ve instructed two ministers to make sure that it happens, he said.

PARIS - It is a humdrum second-hand clothing store in one of the most down-at-heel districts of the French capital, but for designer Francisco Terra and other rising stars of the Paris catwalk, the shop is "a temple of fashion research". Terra loves the place so much he held his Paris fashion week show in the store, the flagship "friperie" of the Guerrisol chain.READ: Young Japanese model conquers fashion world"It is not just people who don't have much money who shop here," the creator behind the Neith Nyer label said, "but all the stylists of the big labels who come to do their homework."His show comes only six weeks after hip brand AVOC presented its menswear collection in another, more upmarket, vintage store.

Faced with a chaotic economy, young people are forced to patching their ancestors' old clothes together to create their new styles.The storyline was inspired by the Japanese capital's thriving secondhand stores, Terra said, which often rework old clothes.Upcycling, as remaking existing clothes is called, has long been the trademark of a number of Paris labels, including streetwear brand Andrea Crews.Upcycled jeans made from cut up old Levi's were also one of the things that helped make French brand Vetements the label of the moment.

They refuse to handle anything in synthetic fibre and outfits have to be in perfect condition, she said.With prices ranging from 40 euros to 2,000 (R554 to R27,683), Nhas said their clients are demanding and know what they want.A green-toned Leonard silk jacket is on sale for 995 euros, while a 1978 Burberry coat is priced at 450 euros."Some customers are real sticklers" for designer labels, she said, "but others would normally shop in high street stores like Zara and just want to find something original to wear with that."Fashion historian Manuel Charpy said vintage mania is nothing new."In the 19th-century secondhand clothing was much more important than today, completely dominating the mass market" and items were sold, again and again, he said.The current hunger for vintage began out of economic necessity after the financial crisis of 2008, said trends specialist Cecile Poignant.The success of the American television series "Mad Men", set in the early 1960s also helped, she said.Vintage clothes "give people reassurance and historical anchorage in changing times", Poignant added."It all has to do with the sense of insecurity people are living with today. We are a lot less sure than we were 30 years ago that the future will be brighter."AFP

JOHANNESBURG - Gupta ally Hamza Farooqui has launched an urgent high court bid to get the South African Reserve Bank and the Registrar of Banks to sign off on its deal to buy the Habib Overseas Bank. The businessman formed a company called Vardospan, shortly after South Africa's four major banks closed the Gupta family's accounts. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is also cited in the court papers, in which Faroooqui complains of trying for seven months to get the go-ahead for the deal.He alleges the Reserve Bank is not allowing the sale of the Habib Bank, due to so-called outside pressures, and that Gordhan is rumoured to be trying to block the sale.READ: End apartheid banking, says Gupta associate's partner eNCA

This issue of social grants is not an issue for Black people, it's not an issue for white people, indian people or coloured people, it's an issue for all of us as South Africans because all of us are affected by the issue that 17-million fellow South Africans face poverty if this government continues. This is a South African issue. That is why we are here in all our colours to say no. We stand for South Africa, we don t stand for corruption, said Maimane.The memorandum was handed over to the department s representatives.

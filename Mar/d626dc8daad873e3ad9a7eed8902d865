JOHANNESBURG - Financial services company Liberty says that 17 percent of the claims it paid out last year were to young people who had lost their jobs.According a report released on Tuesday, Liberty paid out claims totalling R4.3-billion to policyholders last year, 13 percent more than in 2015.This amounted to R17-million every working day.Cancer was responsible for the most claims, with cardiovascular disease second.READ: Liberty puts on a brave face"Cancer or cardiovascular, or heart -related [diseases], are really our main claim causes for all the segments, amounting to probably about 50 percent together, for all segments and regions together of the South African population, Liberty's head of risk product management, Henk Meintjies, said.The highest number of claimants was in Gauteng.Meintjies suggested this was due to the province being the economic hub of the country: "If you look at the number of claims being reported by a province, a lot of that is driven by where the policy holders are living. So Gauteng being the economic hub for South Africa has a lot more economically active individuals. And therefore more people with cover. You see more claims being reported as a result of that in Gauteng,"Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal would have more claims than the other provinces. Unemployment also had an effect on claims. Conditions like retrenchment become quite significant in the younger ages, but as you get older your urogenital diseases and disorders, strokes and central nervous system diseases and disorders ... become more prevalent. While health claims made up the bulk, motor vehicle accidents also took up a large chunk.eNCA

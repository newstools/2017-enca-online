DURBAN Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula cited financial constraints as the main reason that Durban was on the brink of rescinding its status as host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games.The British cities of Liverpool and Birmingham have expressed their interest and eligibility to host in 2022 should Durban drop out.Durban was awarded the showpiece in September 2015, being the only candidate remaining after Edmonton in Canada withdrew.Its possible withdrawal is an embarrassing U-turn for the government after it assured the Commonwealth Games Federation(CGF) committee last year that it was fully committed to hosting the games.The CGF had asked South Africa to fulfill its contractual responsibilities by the end of November 2016.READ: Durban may lose out on hosting Commonwealth Games: MbalulaThe deadline passed and the requirements were not met.The CGF is now reviewing a subsequent submission by Durban, but it is clear that it will be unsatisfactory, due to the absence of the necessary financial guarantees and contingency funds.Mbalula said: We gave it our best but we can t go beyond. If the country says we don t have this money, we can t host it. I don t want to raise your expectations and say everything looks good, it doesn t because we don t agree on the fundamentals, that is the operational budget. African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - Marchers gathered outside both the National Treasury in Pretoria and Parliament in the Cape Town on Friday to protest against President Jacob Zuma s cabinet reshuffle.Zuma made wholesale changes to the cabinet, most notably the removal of Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, from the Finance Ministry.READ: Banks lose R86bn market cap in wake of Gordhan s dismissalThe Save South Africa campaign called on the public on Friday to occupy the National Treasury's headquarters in Pretoria, saying that the reshuffle was an outrage . This is the only way we can stop the capture of National Treasury and prevent the Gupta proxies from getting access to our money, SaveSA said in a statement. The cabinet reshuffle is an insult to the suffering of millions of South Africans over many decades. It is a brazen attempt to undermine the gains of the liberation struggle by taking power away from the people [and ] handing it over to a clique based in Dubai. The convenor of the trade union federation Saftu, Zwelinzima Vavi, reiterated the call for people to assemble in Pretoria.Activists suggest the demonstrations could be replicated in other cities.There's a strange feeling here of fever. A fever about to break.

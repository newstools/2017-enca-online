JOHANNESBURG - The JSE closed weaker on Friday as retailers banks and financials rallied toward the close offsetting a weaker opening but gold and platinum stocks retreated on the day.Property stocks were the star performers for most of the session on a firmer bond market as the rand marginally regained lost ground against the dollar.Gold and platinum stocks were weaker on the stronger dollar as the possibility of a rate hike this month by the US Federal Reserve increased following hawkish views expressed by Fed officials. Investors may have been slow on the uptake to begin with but this week has really driven home the message that not only is a rate hike imminent but that it could come at the Fed meeting in two weeks time Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.The market was awaiting Fed chair Janet Yellen s speech on Friday which was set to come after the JSE s closure. This would be her last public views on rates ahead of the March 15 decision.The market will closely scrutinise Yellen s speech as to clues on a probable rate increase. The forward market is already pricing in a 80% possibility that a rate hike will occur this month.Locally the focus has shifted to the release of GDP data next week. GDP for 2016 is expected to come in at 0.5% with growth in the fourth quarter amounting to 0.6% from 0.7% in the third. Growth was expected to improve somewhat to a still weak pace of recovery of 1.1% in 2017 and only reach 2% by 2020 said Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan.However Capital Economics analyst John Ashbourne expects GDP growth to accelerate to a better than expected 2% this year only to slip to 1.3% in 2019.The better performance this year is partly ascribed to a looser monetary policy. We now forecast that the Reserve Bank will reduce rates from 7% to 6.5% by the end of the year Ashbourne said.Spot gold was 0.57% lower at $1 227 an ounce and platinum dropped 0.62% to $985.09 an ounce.

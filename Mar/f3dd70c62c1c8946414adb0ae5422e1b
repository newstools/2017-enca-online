However once I know the dealings that she is involved in may lead to conflict of interest I immediately instructed her to resign so as we speak now, and as of October 2016 she is not a shareholder nor a director of Impulse," Koko told eNCA in a telephonic interview.Koko insists he didn't finalise the deals, and didn't coerce anyone to work with the company."I don't believe I'm compromised for a start. I've done everything that I had to do when I came to know about this conflict of interest, but the minister has already made a pronouncement that it is a matter of the Board and the Board must manage it and I take direction from the board."Koko was appointed acting chief executive of Eskom in December.He was previously the head of the department issuing tenders to the company.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown has given the Eskom board 90 days to look into the matter.The board has not yet formally met.eNCA

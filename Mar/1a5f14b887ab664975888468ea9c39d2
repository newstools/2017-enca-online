LONDON - Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, this week releases a book of his lyrics spanning more than 40 years and says he has no plan to stop writing music.The "Anarchy in the UK" and "God Save the Queen" singer this week releases "Mr Rotten's Songbook", a collection of his annotated lyric sheets from punk band Sex Pistols and the more experimental Public Image Limited (PiL), as well as never-before-seen artwork."I'm never going to stop, it's the only thing I found that I'm any good at, that's debatable if I'm actually good at it but it's as good as I can get," Lydon told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday."It's the 127 songs I have written so far in my illustrious career," he said. "I started doing little drawings and doodles to try and remember the exact scenarios at the time...But the combination of the two became really, really enjoyable for me."The inspiration for the sell-out publication came from a tour to China where the 61-year-old said authorities wanted to see his written work. Publication has been limited to 1,000 copies.Asked what fans can expect, Lydon, who formed Public Image Limited (PiL) after the Sex Pistols split, said: "I hope a great sense of joy, fun but also the tragedy and pain of what certain songs do for me."Speaking on the day Britain filed divorce papers from the European Union, Lydon also shared his views on Brexit."I would have voted in but (leaving) is what most people now have gone for and I'll back them completely because I believe in democracy," he said. "The EU created some serious problems here for many, many people."Lydon also touched on US President Donald Trump's first two months in the White House, saying: "I think the world needed someone as argumentative as Donald.""How is he anti-establishment? It's business, business as usual and there might be actually some hope and a chance for things to actually progress somewhat," Lydon said."He's an antagonist and antagonism has always been there in me whether I ask for it or not."

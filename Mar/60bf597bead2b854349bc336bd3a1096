It s now finally official. Porsche has announced and detailed the new Panamera Sport Turismo!The car will debut at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show next week, where it will become the first of its kind in the segment.Remember the Panamera competes against the likes of BMW 7 Series and Mercedes-Benz S Class, and none of these have such a shape.Essentially, the Sport Turismo is a wagon and is identical to the normal Panamera all the way up to the B-pillar, where it is said to be totally unique.Porsche created this car not just as a fashion statement, but also to give customers the choice of more luggage space. In that regard, it offers a low loading edge, substantial luggage compartment volume (20 litres more under normal circumstances), and up to 1 390 litres (50 litres more) when the rear seats are folded flat.An optional 230 V electrical socket can also be provided in the boot.Dimensionally it measures 5 metres long, 1.9m wide, 1.4m tall and has a wheelbase of some 2.95m. These are the same figures that the sedan also provides, which means in terms of overall size (bar luggage space), you don t really gain much. Perhaps an Executive model with a 15cm longer wheelbase will be considered in future, especially for China.Secondly the car comes with what its maker calls a 4+1 seating concept. The new Sport Turismo is the first Panamera to feature three rear seats. The two outside seats take the form of individual seats, producing a 2+1 configuration. As an option, the Panamera Sport Turismo is also available in a four-seat configuration with two electrically adjustable individual seats in the rear, according to Porsche.Powertrains are provided for by three engines; a 3.0-litre turbo V6 producing 243kW and 450Nm, a slightly smaller 2.9-litre twin turbo V6 with 324kW and 550Nm, as well as the big dog 4.0-litre twin turbo V8 making 404kW and 770Nm of torque in the Turbo model. All are paired to the new 8-speed PDK automatic that sends power to all four wheels. Nought to 100km/h acceleration times range from 5.5 down to 3.6 seconds, depending on which model is chosen.Interested South African buyers can place their orders for the new Panamera Sport Turismo today already, but will have to wait until 2018 for their first deliveries. So first-come-first-served is the general idea.

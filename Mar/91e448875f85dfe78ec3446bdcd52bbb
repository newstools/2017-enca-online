JOHANNESBURG Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini missed an opportunity at her media conference in Pretoria on Sunday morning to clarify the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) debacle, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said. It is virtually five minutes to midnight and the minister is still playing mind games on the certainty of Sassa s social grants debacle, Outa portfolio director Ben Theron said. South Africa is a constitutional democracy and we expect our political leaders to respect and act within the confines of the highest law of the land, with the minister of social development positioned by the president in order to serve the people of South Africa, he said.READ: Treasury blamed as Sassa grants briefing is cancelledSunday s briefing, on the future of social grants and an assurance that 17 million South Africans would be in good hands come the end of March, was nothing short of a disgrace, he said.This is the transcript of my questions to Minister Dlamini re #SASSA crisis - courtesy The Citizen. pic.twitter.com/p5V1uGWT1n We expected the minister to share the status of negotiations, the costs and the process to transfer responsibility from the contractor to the in-house disbursement management team.Instead, double-speak and denial were the order of the day, with no clarity about the sudden resignation of Mr [Zane] Dangor, her director-general, or the absence of the Sassa CEO at the briefing. After 60 minutes of obfuscation, misdirection, and an attempt to paint a picture of bliss, the outcome of her briefing was summed up in one sentence: We will continue to pay the grants on 1st April , Theron said.Members of the public were none the wiser about the legality of the Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) contract after 31 March; the cost involved of the revised contract after negotiation with CPS; why the Constitutional Court instruction was ignored and the process manipulated to create the current crisis; and what the handover period to new service providers would be.WATCH: Sassa briefs Parliament on grant paymentsParliament s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) had to resort to issuing a summons to Dlamini to appear before the committee on Tuesday.Additionally, she has to appear before the Constitutional Court on 15 March to explain why its 2014 ruling was not implemented despite ample time to do so. Outa believes that South Africa is facing its biggest crisis since democracy and the response from those in charge has been weak, contemptuous and dismissive, leaving society to question whether this grave fiasco is due to gross incompetence or due to planned sabotage in an attempt to achieve another objective? Theron said.At the media conference, Dlamini said CPS would continue to pay out social grants even after its contract expired at the end of the month.If tax payers are paying R11 billion a month, shouldn't they have their questions answered around these issues? #SASSABut the Social Development Department was quick to say no deal had yet been signed with CPS. Discussions with the service provider were ongoing.Dlamini said the plan was to have a transitional period at the end of which Sassa would take over the responsibility of paying out social grants. She said the South African Post Office would also be involved.In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that Sassa s contract with CPS was invalid because the tender process had been flawed.African News Agency

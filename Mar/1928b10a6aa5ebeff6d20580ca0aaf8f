JOHANNESBURG - Wesbank has been referred to the consumer tribunal for allegedly breaching the National Credit Act.The credit regulator says it's been investigating the company's debt collection practices.The probe shows the vehicle financing house lured consumers into handing over their cars.This practice contravenes the credit act, which provides for defaulting consumers to return their cars voluntarily.At the same time, the regulator is advising consumers that credit providers can only repossess cars if they are authorised by a court order.eNCA

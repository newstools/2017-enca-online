DHARAMSALA - The riposte was emphatic, decisive and telling, in a manner behoving of the No.1 side in the world.Outclassed and outmuscled on a minefield in Pune a little over a month back, India put it past Australia in the most un-Indian of conditions at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala.An emotion-driven eight-wicket victory, brought up with a flourish by Ajinkya Rahane in his first Test as captain, helped the home side round off a season of plenty by wresting back the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on Tuesday s fourth morning.The 2-1 series triumph was India s fourth this season, this its 10th win in 13 games and easily the most satisfying, especially given that it was achieved in the absence of the injured Virat Kohli and on a surface that had more in it for the visiting side than the host.READ: India set a target of 106 runs to win fourth TestBarring the extraordinary, an Indian victory was always going to be a formality after the heroics of its bowlers on the third afternoon.The target was only 106 and India had already lopped 19 off that modest number on Monday evening without losing a wicket.Even given the topsy-turvy nature of this Test indeed this series it would need a combination of exceptional bowling and extremely poor batting for the inevitable not to eventuate.With an expectant crowd cheering the batsmen on, India started the morning brightly, weathered a mini-wobble when it lost two wickets in the same Pat Cummins over without the addition of a single run, and then sprinted to victory.Rahane warmed up for the IPL starting in a little over a week by lighting up the day with audacious strokeplay that Steven Smith, his Rising Pune Supergiant skipper, must have watched with mixed feelings.READ: Marsh, Handscomb halt India march in 3rd TestAustralia should have come hard through Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. Instead it opened proceedings with the latter and Steve O Keefe, the left-arm spinner.Rahul immediately stamped his authority with flowing strokes on both sides of the wicket even as M Vijay looked horribly out of sorts, especially against Hazlewood.But by the time Cummins was brought on in the day s sixth over, India had already eased to 40; Cummins should have had Vijay s number with his first delivery when the opener gloved him down the leg side, but there was no more than a half-token appeal that found no favour with Ian Gould.Vijay s misery, however, wouldn t last long. In Cummins s next over, he tamely followed a delivery that held its line to Matthew Wade, but 46 runs were already on the board and there were few alarms.Ajinkya Rahane scored a quickfire 27-ball 38 as India chased down the target of 106 in the first session on day 4.But this has been a fascinating Test match where the only thing predictable has been its unpredictability. Cheteshwar Pujara, calm and composed and who hasn t even heard of the word hurry , inexplicably ran himself out looking for a non-existent single after a stop-start routine with Rahul that Glenn Maxwell pounced on to score a direct hit.Pujara, India s highest scorer this series, had failed to tickle the scorers, and at 46/2, there must have been a few nerves in the dressing-room. It was the first time in 50 innings at home that Pujara was dismissed without scoring.Out came Rahane, and immediately assumed the role of the aggressor even as Rahul went a little bit off the boil. One gorgeous off-drive off Cummins was followed by a disdainful pull over mid-wicket off the following delivery, and India was purring again.READ: Australia hold out for draw in 3rd India TestWhatever hope might have been ignited by two strikes in six deliveries dissipated in quick timw for Australia.Cummins tried to bounce the Indian captain out, and Rahane responded in kind like he had at the MCG in December 2014, pulling with certainty and conviction even as Australia began to read the writing on the wall.In a final throw of the dice, with 35 needed, Cummins went round the sticks to try and unsettle Rahane. The first ball was sent deep into the stands behind mid-wicket.The next elicited a more brutal response as Rahane backed away, and clattered him over cover and into the crowd. It was exhilarating stuff.It was also the kind of finish India would have expected to a series where it had been severely tested, but where it had also dug deep and channelled its inner desire and hunger.Gradually, Rahul s fluency too returned and it was in the fitness of things that, as the clock ticked over to 10.52am, he brought up the winning runs with an elegant whip to mid-wicket.The brace took Rahul past fifty for the sixth time in seven innings this series, and India to the finishing post.Done deal, just 82 minutes into day four. Champion stuff, champagne time. African News Agency

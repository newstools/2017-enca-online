HAMILTON, New Zealand - New Zealand were left frustrated on Wednesday after rain washed out the last day's play of the final Test against South Africa, denying them a series-levelling win.At the start of the day, South Africa were on the ropes at 80 for five in their second innings, still 95 runs short of making New Zealand bat again.But the rain which had disrupted part of each of the first four days fell persistently on Wednesday, forcing the umpires to abandon play without a ball being bowled.

As a whole series we can look at the top six, the lack of hundreds, the lack of good starts we had, we were playing with our backs to the wall most of the time as a batting unit. That's a real concern," he said.South Africa's best opening partnership was 18 in Wellington, and Dean Elgar's 140 in Dunedin was their only century.New Zealand's best opening partnership was an 83 in Hamilton and they scored a century in every Test.Williamson scored 130 in Dunedin and 176 in Hamilton, with Henry Nicholls scoring 118 in Wellington.AFP

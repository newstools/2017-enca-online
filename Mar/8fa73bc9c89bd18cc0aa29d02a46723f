JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma once again reiterated that there was no reason to panic about whether or not social grants will be paid on 1 April. He said the matter has been blown out of proportion.

"They are saying many things which i don't think is right, exciting the country. "If we had reached the date and nothing happened, what people are saying either dismiss the minister or whatever; how could you do that before the day comes. "That's what's been making me to be very reluctant to make comments. But the fact of the matter is that before i left for Indonesia, i called the Minister of SocialDevelopment and Minister of Finance to say they must work out a solution and when i come back i must get a report. That's what i'm waiting for", said Zuma. WATCH: President Jacob #Zuma on the #SASSA social grants debacle. pic.twitter.com/pEiWYQCuTv eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Television personality Palesa Madisakwane was in the firing line on twitter on Friday, after she criticised musician and actor Zola 7. Madisakwane, who is also employed as a news anchor at ANN7, called Zola “irrelevant” and told him to “stop acting like a celebrity”, after Zola refused to grant the channel an interview during Joe Mafela’s memorial service on Thursday. Some Twitter users defended the musician, saying it was his right to decide if he wanted to be interviewed or not. Madisakwane deleted her tweets and later wrote that her PR/Assistant posted on her behalf. She then issued an apology to Zola and South Africans who were offended by her posts. If you missed the #Palesa attack on #Zola

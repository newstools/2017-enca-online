JOHANNESBURG - ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe refused to comment at a press briefing on Monday on the recall of the finance minister from the UK.Briefing journalists on the ANC national executive committee (NEC) meeting at the weekend, Mantashe said it had recommitted itself to the ANC position that land distribution was a matter of urgency.Asked repeatedely about the calling home of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Depty Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas from a UK investment roadshow, Mantashe said that was a government matter and the NEC had nothing to do with it.He responded to questions about the recall being a precursor to the Gupta court case against Gordhan or to a cabinet reshuffle, Mantashe said that would be "speculation".

PRETORIA - The former chief executive of the Passenger rail Agency of SA (Prasa) Lucky Montana says outgoing board chairman Popo Molefe must leave quietly. If I were Popo Molefe, I would leave quietly and stop shouting at General Ntlemeza. Some of the things he did are outright criminality. Montana accused Molefe on Thursday of having committed crimes during his time at the agency. Number 1: Popo M wanted Lucky Montana's head at all cost & this, he did at a huge cost to PRASA. The social & economic costs are immense. Number 2: His greed lead him to cancel contracts to replace them with his own cronies. The result was the collapse of rail services. Number 3: Popo Molefe became so arrogant and felt PRASA belonged to him. He started showing Min Dipuo Peters & Government his middle finger.

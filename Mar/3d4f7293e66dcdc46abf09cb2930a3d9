 CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma is answering questions on the Sassa debacle in the National Assembly on Thursday. It’s the President’s first question and answer session in Parliament this year. MPs are waiting to hear if he’ll take any action against Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. Dlamini has led her department into a national crisis on paying social welfare grants. Zuma is also expected to face questions about whether he intends to appoint former Eskom boss Brian Molefe to an executive position in government. !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

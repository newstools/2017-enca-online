In the last two months, officials stopped eight children from being smuggled out of the country. There are many people involved including a Czech Republic national who had paid for a child they had never met and the child was going to meet this parent for the first time in Mauritius and travel to Europe, Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba said. Two years ago, government revised its immigration laws, hoping to curb trafficking. It requires all travelling minors to produce an unabridged birth certificate, and a letter of parental consent if the child is not travelling with both parents. It's self-evident, if the visa regulations were not there, 15 children this year would have left the country destinations unknown, Gigaba said. Officials are puzzled as to how the traffickers managed to get fake documents. The department says there s clearly a syndicate at work.READ: Government takes action after report exposes human trafficking"It's been proven that some of these activities are from the same office," said Home Affairs Ekurhuleni District Manager, Mamokubung Moeketsi.All the children of the attempted trafficking are now in a place of safety, while the suspected traffickers are in custody, as investigations continue.eNCA

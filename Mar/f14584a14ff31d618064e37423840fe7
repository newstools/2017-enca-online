DURBAN - Firefighters were on Saturday morning still battling a blaze at the Transnet warehouse in Durban along the harbour.The fire which started on Friday morning has raged on, but firefighters have managed to prevent it from spreading to areas which were going to be problematic.eThekweni Fire Chief Enoch Mchunu said that the fire has been contained, but the presence of plastic and wax in the burning building added to the strong prevailing winds had made it difficult to extinguish."We did have a large area of wax which posed a lot of difficulty for us, but in the main we have a wind factor that was giving us difficulties, said Mchunu. We had a very strong southerly wind which really made it difficult for us, but under the circumstances we tried our best and we managed to contain it."GALLERY: Durban warehouse fire bathes skyline in blackThree firefighters suffered minor burns on Friday but no civilians have been injured by the blaze.Businesses around the area were told to evacuate on Friday night as the Rossburgh fire kept burning. eNCA

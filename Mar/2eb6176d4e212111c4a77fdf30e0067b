LONDON - A women's club tournament will start in September in England to further ramp up the popularity of the rapidly growing women's game in the country, its governing Rugby Football Union says.The 10-team domestic Super Rugby league competition is also designed to bolster the professionalism of women's rugby, with Bristol, Harlequins, Saracens and Wasps all involved in the inaugural edition.Nigel Melville, RFU's professional rugby director and former captain of the England men's national side, said: "This is another significant development for women's rugby in this country."Women's Super Rugby will drive standards in the game, both domestically and at an elite level, and continue to encourage more women and girls to play the sport.The other teams are Darlington Mowden Park, Firwood Waterloo Ladies, Gloucester-Hartpury, Loughborough Students, Richmond and Worcester.The England senior women's team are now a professional squad and it is hoped the new league will help more players avoid the kind of clashes between full-time work and rugby that confronted them after they won the 2014 World Cup in France.AFP

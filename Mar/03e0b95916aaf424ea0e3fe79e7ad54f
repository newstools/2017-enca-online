CAPE TOWN - Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini briefed stakeholders in Cape Town about the grants issue on Monday afternoon. She used the opportunity to lambast the media, claiming that Black journalists understand the consequences of people not receiving their grants at the end of the month, while other journalists are driving 'an agenda'.Dlamini noted that at the time the Constitutional Court set aside the CPS tender, the court said that a new tender process must be initiated.She said such a process did begin, but one bidder dropped out and two others did not have the capacity to manage the tender.Dlamini said the department had for two years unsuccessfully attempted to find an alternative supplier.She assured pensioners and other recipients that they would receive their grants as expected on April 1. #SASSA Minister Dlamini assuring pensioners all will be well come April 1st. pic.twitter.com/ssoSI6aGyKDlamini apologised to South Africa for underestimating the amount of work involved in instituting a new tender.She noted that the department had held discussions with Treasury and President Zuma on Saturday and she was confident that the interested parties would reach a resolution.Dlamini affirmed Treasury's position that they would only support a tender with CPS if the Constitutional Court endorsed such a move. She said papers had been filed with the court on Friday.But the minister reiterated that her department proposed to continue with the invalid CPS contract for another two years while it worked towards finding an alternative.eNCA

PARLIAMENT - President Jacob Zuma says there’s no need to take action against Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini because the Sassa deadline for grants to be paid has not yet been reached. The President was answering questions in the National Assembly on Thursday. While apologising to grant recipients for the uncertainty, he said there’s no reason to doubt a solution will be found. "We deeply regret the current situation as government. We will ensure that there is never again any apprehension with regard to the payments of social grants to our people. Action against ministers is the prerogative of the president," he said.
	
	After the Chief Justice and the Constitutional Court laid bare the mismanagement by the Social Development Department in the face of the social grants crisis, there was an air of expectation in the National Assembly. The issue was top of mind during President Zuma’s question time, and it wasn’t long before MPs wanted to know his intentions on the matter.  // <![CDATA[

"Cosatu has called for her to be removed, South Africans are calling for her to be removed, I'm certainly one of those saying she must be removed," he said. "Do you not think it is time for you to act and remove minister Bathabile Dlamini from cabinet?" Maimane enquired.  // <![CDATA[

// ]]> MPs pushed the president to answer for his role in the grants crisis, why his lawyer Michael Hulley has been involved in negotiations, and even hinting that Cash Paymaster Services is bankrolling an ANC faction.  // <![CDATA[

// ]]> The Inkatha Freedom Party then caused a stir when one of its questions involved Cash Paymaster Services and party funding. "Will you, now, establish a commission of inquiry to look into this dodgy deal? Look at, for example, there's a rumour in the ANC caucus that CPS is paying for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's campaign and I want you to comment on that," asked IFP MP, Liezel van der Merwe. The President didn’t initially answer but later claimed the IFP had never provided evidence of CPS's dodgy dealings -- while van der Merwe waved her papers in the air in objection. The UDM's Bantu Holomisa then asked Zuma about alleged illegal deductions from Sassa grant payments. Zuma responded saying he has not seen any evidence of such-like, and therefore cannot act without any evidence. He told Holomisa to present the evidence. Zuma was also reminded of the Public Protector’s State of Capture report, and former Eskom-CEO now ANC MP Brian Molefe. "How is it that you allowed your party to deploy a person of such questionable ethics to this honourable house, which is supposed to be the bastion of political virtue?" enquired NFP MP, Mandlenkosi Mabika.  "Allegations are not convictions. Allegations are allegations…" Zuma responded, referring to Molefe. "Why should you be guilty before you are tried? I don't understand. I don't understand and therefore if the ruling party takes a decision to deploy its member, it has a right to do so," he added, clearly exasperated. President Zuma now has a break from the grilling in Parliament and is only expected back in the National Assembly in a few months’ time. eNCA

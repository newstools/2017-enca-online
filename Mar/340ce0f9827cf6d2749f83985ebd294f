NEW YORK On September 11, 2001 they quietly provided refuge to nearly 7,000 anguished airline passengers. Nearly 16 years later, ordinary Canadians from Newfoundland are the heroes of a musical making its Broadway debut.On that day, 38 jets landed at Gander airport just minutes apart when US airspace closed after the al-Qaeda plane strikes on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, which killed nearly 3,000 people.Gander may once have been a busy refuelling base for trans-Atlantic flights, but those years were long gone by and the airport had never known such a frenzied pace of arrivals.Thousands of residents mobilised to help the trapped passengers, some forced to spend more than 20 hours on planes before being allowed to disembark. The ensuing days of cohabitation left an indelible impression on everyone."The first day, these 7,000 people that landed were strangers. And after five days, it was like 7,000 people added to your family," recalls Gander mayor Claude Elliott, who is stepping down this fall after 21 years in the job.But if it might be easy to imagine such fraught days being turned into a book, a film or even a play, a musical was less easy to imagine.When Elliott first heard that two Canadian writers were working to turn those frantic days into the plot of a musical, he had his doubts."It was a little bit scary at first," he admits, not least because the mayor's character is so central to the cast.But writers Irene Sankoff and David Hein have turned dozens of interviews into Come From Away, a work faithful to the atmosphere of those five extraordinary days.Each actor plays at least two roles, often that of a Gander resident and an airline passenger.'Something nice' The musical, which makes its official Broadway debut Sunday after successful trial runs in San Diego, Seattle, Toronto and Washington has deftly avoided pathos and is peppered with a light comedic touch.The songs are less flamboyant than some of Broadway's big hitters, the music is subdued, the orchestra sits on stage rather than in the pit, and there is a Celtic influence and a dishevelled tone that do much to capture the mood.Elliott says he loves the end result."It's first class," he says. "It's certainly telling the story that happened in Gander. It's right on."He saw it three times in Canada, and is planning to attend the show twice in New York, where Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also to take in a performance on March 15.The underlying message of kinship between citizens from all over the world is a prescient theme in the context of the global refugee crisis and Donald Trump's protectionist anti-migration policies.The passengers, especially Americans returning from overseas, "needed a lot of help, food, clothing, but most important, they needed love and compassion", recalls Elliott."A lot of American passengers were wondering what kind of country they were going back to. We gave them that reassurance that goodness and kindness will prevail every time over hatred," he tells AFP.The writers avoid the trap of cliches by showcasing the tensions, frustrations and impatience, but also prejudice with a Muslim passenger who arouses suspicion.They also include the story of one of the airline pilots, Beverley Bass, who tells the audience about being a woman in a man's world and the pitfalls she needs to navigate to become their equal."A lot of people learned a lot of things about life," remembers Natasha Gagarin, 41, a distant cousin of the Soviet astronaut and who was a United stewardess on one of the last planes to land on Gander that day."It was a horrible day, but something nice came out of it," she says.AFP

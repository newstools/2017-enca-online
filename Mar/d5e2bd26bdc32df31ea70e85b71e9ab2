At the time they assured the court that they would be ready to take over the payment of social grants from Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) by the 1st of April 2017.CPS is responsible for paying grants to 17-million people every month, its contract expires at the end of this month.The court papers further states that the minister recognised the grants crisis in October last year already and that she should have been more aware at an earlier stage.In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that Sassa's contract with CPS was invalid, because the tender process was flawed.Dangor said that he has resigned because of a complete breakdown in relationship between him and the Minister over the payment of social grants and the legal requirements obliged by SASSA.Dangor, who previously served as the minister s special advisor since 2010 until his appointment last November, said he could no longer work in the department as the environment has become toxic. I resigned as a result of breakdown in relations and disagreements on management of processes leading up to April 1, said Dangor. The major disagreements were on obligations in relation to the Constitutional Court, we had differences on responsibilities of management of the legal issues in relation to the Constitutional Court. The only disagreements we have been having is around the processes for April 1 and we have reached a peak in the last week, we have not always been on the same page on this issue since we started talking about what needed to be done when this contract comes to an end and its urgency of the grant payments. Dangor said it was unfortunate that the department could not find a solution that excluded CPS from the paying out of grants much earlier.Dangor could not be drawn on whether Dlamini should resign or be fired for the debacle but has revealed that he will serve his three months notice period.eNCA

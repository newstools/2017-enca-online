ABIDJAN - Prosecutors on Tuesday demanded a life jail term for Ivory Coast's former first lady Simone Gbagbo, who is on trial for alleged crimes against humanity."Gentlemen of the jury, you will declare Madame Gbagbo guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes, and sentence her to life imprisonment," prosecutor Aly Yeo urged in his summing up at the country's top criminal court.He described Gbagbo as a shadowy figure who orchestrated attacks on her husband's opponents."After her spouse came to power, she started to impose herself as the real head of Ivory Coast, the army, the police and gendarmerie," Yeo said.Gbagbo, the 67-year-old wife of former president Laurent Gbagbo, was not in court as the jury retired to consider its verdict expected.READ: ICoast judge says Gbagbo trial can happen without herOnce dubbed Ivory Coast's "Iron Lady", Simone Gbagbo is already serving a 20-year sentence for "endangering state security".Laurent Gbagbo is on trial for crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and persecution, having been handed over in November 2011 to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.The ICC wanted to prosecute his wife, too, and issued a warrant for her arrest, but Ivorian authorities refused to hand her over, insisting she would receive a fair trial at home.Some 3,000 people died in five months of unrest in the west African republic after Laurent Gbagbo refused to accept the result of presidential elections in 2010.READ: Ivory Coast's former first lady said Gbagbo would have hit herYeo said Simone Gbagbo headed a crisis cell -- "a genuine decision-making body" that allegedly coordinated attacks by armed forces and pro-Gbagbo militias.The evidence came from documents found in the home of the presidential couple when they were arrested on 11 September 2011, he said."She replied to correspondence from arms dealers offering weapons and combat helicopters," said Yeo.She is accused of distributing arms to militias who backed her husband following his election defeat.In one case, she allegedly played an indirect role in the shelling of a market in Abobo, a Ouattara stronghold in the capital, Abidjan, in November 2010.AFP

JOHANNESBURG The sentencing of Nigerian national Ugochukwu Eke, who was found guilty on three charges related to trafficking a minor whom he also sexually exploited, was on Friday postponed to allow the judge to consider arguments in mitigation.Eke, was found guilty on Tuesday of sexual exploitation of a child, living off the earnings of sexual exploitation, being an accomplice to rape and contravening the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act.Defence lawyer, Advocate Sechaba Mokhachane, argued that his client Eke who resides in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, has since stopped all the illegal activities he was involved in and was now making an honest living out of buying and selling second hand cars.READ: Fed-up Rosettenville residents torch 'brothels', tavernsMokhachane said Eke has a three-year-old son whom he takes care of. The accused pays R500 a week for his son s school fees, the lawyer said. When Eke met the minor, she was already sexually active thus he should be given a lighter sentence or a fine. Besides, the country s prisons are already overcrowded and that is a waste of taxpayers money, Mokhachane told the South Gauteng High Court.However, Judge Majake Mabesele argued that what Eke had done to the underage girl was equivalent to premeditated murder and rape combined .The judge said Eke arrived in South Africa eight years ago and has been making a living out of selling drugs and sexual exploitation. How many children s lives has he ruined? Initially there were four girls who were found in that house, where have the three disappeared to? asked Mabesele.Giving evidence in aggravation, Lieutenant Colonel Parmanand Jagwa of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said most trafficking crimes in the country were also linked to labour and sexual exploitation of victims. I started being a coordinator of human trafficking in 2003 and Rosettenville is one of the places where we find a lot of people being sexually exploited. The traffickers look at the vulnerability of children and women, and they then subject them to either alcohol or drugs to get a grip of them, explained Jagwa.Judge Mabesele said he needed more time to ponder so he adjourned the matter.Eke will now be sentenced on 13 March.VIDEO: 16 girls rescued from human traffickersAfrican News Agency

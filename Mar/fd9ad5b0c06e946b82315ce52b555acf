DURBAN - Student leader Bonginkosi Khanyile says he’s willing to go back to jail in the cause of free education. Khanyile was released from Westville Prison on Thursday after five months imprisonment after the Constitutional Court on Wednesday set his bail at R250. He was arrested during chaotic Fees Must Fall protests in Durban. “If we want free education to be a reality we must be prepared to sacrifice. I have played my role but by the looks of things, I don’t think it’s the last time I’m going to prison,” said Khanyile. Khanyile’s bail conditions prohibit him from holding illegal gatherings on campus or interfering with police and security. He is due in court again later this month. *View the attached video for more on this story. eNCA

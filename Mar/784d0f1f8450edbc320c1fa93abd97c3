JOHANNESBURG The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, (Numsa) on Monday said it will participate in negotiations with the Road Accident Fund (RAF), which will be facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).About 1,500 Numsa members at RAF have been on strike since the 16 March 2017 because the organisation is in dire financial distress. The workers are also demanding wage parity. Numsa has resolved to intensify the strike during the course of the mediation and has engaged members to implement a total shut down of the RAF, at the East London, Durban and Pretoria branches. It cannot be business as usual at the RAF when it is in shambles, said the union s general secretary, Irvin Jim.READ: Minister apologises for road accident payments delay This organisation perpetuates inequality by refusing to deal decisively with massive income gaps. In addition, working conditions for workers are deteriorating at an alarming rate. Jim said RAF assets are routinely attached over outstanding debt. surely, this cannot be allowed to continue, especially because it has an impact on the RAF s ability to pay out claims. We are concerned about whether claimants at the RAF have had their confidentiality violated as a result of the chaotic state of the organisation, which is why we asked the Public Protector to investigate. The Numsa general secretary said the Public Protector has confirmed receipt of our complaint, and they will confirm soon whether they can take it further . As Numsa we believe the Public Protector must ensure that the RAF runs efficiently for the sake of workers and society in general, said Jim.He said the CCMA will be facilitating mediation at the RAF Menlyn offices in Pretoria on the 27th and the 28th of March 2017.African News Agency

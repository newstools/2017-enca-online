LONDON England coach Eddie Jones has named a 24-man squad to face Scotland at Twickenham in London on Saturday, in the penultimate round of fixtures in the 2017 Six Nations Championship.England is attempting to equal the Tier 1 world record for consecutive Test victories, currently 18 matches and held by New Zealand. The record was set recently, from August 2015 to October 2016.Returning after injury are loose forward Billy Vunipola and wing Anthony Watson. Vunipola may have to wait on the bench, with Nathan Hughes having made the most of the former s absence at eighthman.It will be interesting to see which two of the four possible wings Jones uses to start, as Elliot Daly has been a revelation at left wing and is arguably one of the tournament s best finishers to date.Prop Joe Marler will win his 50th cap for England if selected.England, the only undefeated team in the championship, tops the table and is seeking a second consecutive Grand Slam, which involves winning all five matches in the tournament.Meanwhile, Scotland has experienced a long-awaited return to form, after several years of under-achievement in the northern hemisphere s premier annual tournament.The Scots best recent results against England were a 15-15 draw in 2010, and a 15-9 victory in 2008, both coming in Six Nations matches at Murrayfield in Edinburgh.However, they have not won in London since 1983. Should they prevail, it will be their first Triple Crown since 1990. The Triple Crown involves beating all the other British home nations and Ireland (which, in rugby, includes Northern Ireland).In Scotland s case, they have already stunned Ireland and Wales in previous rounds of this year s edition, so the English scalp, at the fortress of Twickenham, would be very sweet.As if the stakes couldn t be higher, the Calcutta Cup is also on offer. The England versus Scotland fixture was the first-ever international Test in rugby union in 1879 and is thus the oldest in the sport.England squad: Forwards Dan Cole, Jamie George, Dylan Hartley, James Haskell, Nathan Hughes, Maro Itoje, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, Joe Marler, Kyle Sinckler, Billy Vunipola, Mako Vunipola, Tom Wood. Backs Mike Brown, Danny Care, Elliot Daly, Owen Farrell, George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, Jonny May, Jack Nowell, Ben Te o, Anthony Watson, Ben Youngs.AFP

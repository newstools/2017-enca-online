DURBAN The SA Under-20 team (Amajita) went down 2-1 to Guinea in the CAF Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations third place playoff at Heroes National Stadium in Lusaka, Zambia on Sunday.Having achieved their first mandate of reaching the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in South Korea in May, coach Thabo Senong fielded fringe players in this encounter but despite gaining greater possession throughout the match, Amajita s backline problems resurfaced again. First they conceded an own goal, before captain Tercious Malepe conceded a penalty when he handled in the box to consign South Africa to a fourth place finish. Liam Jordan opened the scoring for South Africa in the fifth minute after a great through-ball was played to him by Sipho Mbule. However, Guinea found themselves on equal terms just two minutes later when Katlego Mohamme scored an own goal when he headed past goalkeeper Sanele Tshabalala.READ: Amajita through to U20 Afcon semi-finals, qualify for World CupGuinea were forced to make a substitution at the beginning of the second half after Daouda Camara was forced to come out due to injury, he was replaced by Naby Bangoura.

Coach Thabo Senong made two changes with Luther Singh coming on for Itumenelg Shopane in the 53rd minute and Sibongakonke Mbatha on the hour mark. But it was Guinea substitute Naby Bangoura who had the final say when he scored from the penalty spot. This has been a great tournament and I am very happy that all the players got a chance to play. Guinea is a good team and we had chances, especially in the first half where we could have at least had two goals and seal the match, said Sening. Unfortunately we conceded an own goal and the penalty which are part of bizarre things we always try to avoid in the game of football. African News Agency

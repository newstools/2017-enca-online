CAPE TOWN - A group of wheelchair-bound children from Cape Town are getting the ride of a lifetime by participate in the country's biggest timed cycle race, the Cape Argus Pick n Pay Cycle tour.109kms is no easy ride, but the breath-taking views along this route will hopefully motivate these little warriors - who are each towed in a buggy behind an able bodied cyclist - to keep going.READ: Oscar Trial: Sports doctor speaks of disabled athletes' challengesDiedre Gower, whose son Damian was left disabled after a routine injection, started Warrior on Wheels as she didn't want him to be seen as different from other children.She said, Damian and I (have) had a very exciting life, he had all sorts of adventures and we wanted to share this with other children with disabilities. In 2012 I first signed up to do the cycle tour and I wanted to do it with Damian but was denied permission.We appealed and in 2013 it was approved, and so in 2013 we did our first cycle race, and with our own foundation now we want other children to participate and see the buggy teams grow in number as the years go by. The non-profit organisation has now extended this to other children with similar challenges.* View the attached video for more on this story eNCA

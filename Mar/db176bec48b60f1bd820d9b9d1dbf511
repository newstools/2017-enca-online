CAPE TOWN The City of Cape Town has been ranked as one of the top five cities in the world out of 533 cities for demonstrating leadership in climate disclosure where it measures and discloses energy and climate action data annually to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), mayor Patricia de Lille said on Sunday.This achievement saw Cape Town joining over 500 cities, 100 state and regional governments, and 5800 companies now measuring and disclosing climate action data on an annual basis in order to manage emissions, build resilience, and protect themselves from the growing impacts of climate change. We are indeed proud that our work is playing a part in the global efforts to address climate change and to be placed alongside other leading cities like Mexico City, Paris, Sydney, and Vancouver as one of the top five reporting cities, she said. These results and our work to map our progress in addressing climate change is in line with the city s organisational development and transformation plan (ODTP) and its aims to create an organisation that is more dynamic, more progressive, and more customer-centric. Our results and reporting to the CDP also underscore one of our 11 transformational priorities as part of the ODTP to position Cape Town as a forward-thinking, globally competitive business city, De Lille said.READ: 2017 already marked by climate extremes: UNThe CDP is a not-for-profit organisation that provides the global platform for cities and companies to manage, measure, and disclose their energy and climate data.Every year the CDP and multinational engineering firm AECOM highlight cities which excelling in climate disclosure and showcase each city s efforts with an InFocus Report.

In a quest to lift children out of the shadows of TB - and in celebration of his mother's life - Grenfel was inspired to get on his bike."Since I was a kid, my mom encouraged my love of riding," says Grenfell.Fast forward a few years later and Grenfell started riding competitively, entering races (both road and MTB).Grenfell is currently in intense training for the joBerg2c."My 'journey' to joBerg2c started in November last year when I got it into my head that I was going to do this race, no matter what," said Grenfell."TB is a disease that not only affects poor, rural people, but it can affect anyone. My Mother lived in Bryanston, shopped in Fourways so one can imagine the shock at hearing she had TB."The disease is often missed or overlooked due to non-specific symptoms and difficulties in diagnosis, which was what happened in my mom's case. This particular race is incredibly special to me. I'll be riding solo because it is the biggest and toughest challenge that I ve ever taken on, and it s my own 'personal journey' - a personal test (and quest) and memorial for me," says Kevin. eNCA

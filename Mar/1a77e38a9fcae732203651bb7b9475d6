JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma once again reiterated that there was no reason to panic about whether or not social grants will be paid on 1 April.He said the matter has been blown out of proportion.

But the fact of the matter is that before i left for Indonesia, i called the Minister of SocialDevelopment and Minister of Finance to say they must work out a solution and when i come back i must get a report. That's what i'm waiting for", said Zuma. WATCH: President Jacob #Zuma on the #SASSA social grants debacle. pic.twitter.com/pEiWYQCuTv eNCA

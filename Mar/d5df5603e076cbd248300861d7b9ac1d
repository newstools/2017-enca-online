JOHANNESBURG The South African Communist Party (SACP), an ally of the governing African National Congress, said on Friday the public should take serious action to prevent corruption at the treasury after President Jacob Zuma axed the finance minister Pravin Gordhan in a late-night cabinet shake-up.Earlier on Thursday, the SACP revealed that Zuma had consulted them on Monday on his intention to fire both Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas from the finance ministry, which the party objected to.READ: Gigaba replaces Gordhan in cabinet reshuffleHowever later in the day, Zuma announced 15 changes to his cabinet."Quite clearly South Africans need to take action against the possibility of the looting of the treasury which comrade Pravin Gordhan has done an excellent job (preventing)," said the SACP's Second Deputy President Solly Mapaila in an interview on Talk Radio 702. Zuma appointed Malusi Gigaba as the country's new finance minister, replacing Gordhan whom he had rehired to the post in December 2015 after summarily replacing Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister with minnow David (Des) van Rooyen.

JOHANNESBURG - Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba urged leaders on Sunday not to promote vigilantism through xenophobic speech.He appeared to be taking a swipe at Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba, without mentioning his name. Mashaba last week reiterated his views on dealing with illegal immigrants."You are unwittingly encouraging vigilantism. And you are reducing human beings into animals," Gigaba said at a justice, crime prevention and security cluster briefing in Pretoria.."I will repeat: this country can t be a jungle this country required the rule of law."READ: Gauteng xenophobia: Gigaba and Mashaba trade accusationsFollowing the violence directed at foreigners in February, government has said that anyone who feels unsafe or whose rights are infringed upon must report this to the police.At the same time it has warned that foreign nationals in the country illegally will be repatriated.But Gigaba said: "Undocumented immigrants though they are in South African in breach of our immigration laws are human beings and will be treated within our human rights ethos." eNCA

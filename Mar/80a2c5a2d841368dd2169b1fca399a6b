I was controlling it. I had more errors than I like and lower first serve percentage than I would like," said Williams."I have to play well against the number one in the world. She's on top of her game and she played well, so I had to find a way to play a little better," added the American.Kerber has yet to win a tournament this year and most recently went out in the round of 16 in Indian Wells."This wasn't the best start I would have wished for, but it's not a drama because I'm still playing good and winning matches. I'm looking forward to playing again," she said."It wasn't my best game, but she deserved to win because she played really well tonight," added the German.Konta's victory over made her the first British woman to reach the last four at Miami."I'm really happy that I've come through and I am just looking forward to my next round - it's going to be a tough one," said Konta.Halep settled well in the opening set, with her powerful forehand dominant, but Konta fought back well in the second.READ: Venus and Serena Williams go home to ComptonThe Australia-born Konta broke early to establish a 3-0 lead but the gritty Romanian clawed her way back winning the next three games while her opponent failed to make the most of her openings in what was an error-strewn contest.Nonethless, Konta stuck at her task and was able to break again when Halep was serving for the match and force a tie-break which she eventually won 9-7 to take the pair into the third game.There was a tense discussion between Halep and her Australian coach Darren Cahill.Konta broke in the fifth game of the deciding set and visibly growing in confidence she broke again to take a 5-2 lead and serve out for the match.AFP

LAS VEGAS The Blitzboks will have to show all their skill, courage and pride in the jersey if they want to trump hosts US in the semifinals of the HSBC Las Vegas Sevens and secure a fifth consecutive final in the HSBC World Sevens Series.This is the view of Springbok Sevens coach Neil Powell after the Blitzboks confirmed a top-four spot for the fifth time in as many tournaments by beating Australia 17-14 at the Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas earlier on Sunday (SA time).They now face the US, who earlier dumped Argentina, while Fiji and New Zealand will contest the other semifinal. This will be a massive match for us as the US will be pumped by the big crowd and their desire to win their first home tournament, said Powell on the showdown that kicks off at 11.44pm (SA time) on Sunday.A post shared by SA Rugby (@bokrugby) on The US team is packed with game breakers and with the support from the locals will be a tough opponent. We did not come here to lose, so we will have to be at our best for that one if we want to play in the final later, Powell said.The Blitzboks made it into the final four of the series for a fifth consecutive time, courtesy of a hard-fought win over Australia in the Cup quarterfinals and Powell praised his team s composure in the final minutes.A late try by Rosko Specman, his fourth in the tournament, edged his team into the lead and determined defence by the Blitzboks in the final minutes of the match secured the win.Blitzboks captain Philip Snyman acknowledged the effort from their opponents. We knew this was going to be a hard one, Australia are a class team and they gave it their all, said Snyman, who has made 15 tackles, the most for his team so far.The captain admitted that they were forced into unnecessary mistakes and did not play a faultless game.Post Match Interview | @snymanphilip talks us through South Africa's toughly fought win over Australia at the #HSBC7s pic.twitter.com/jJ2rnP3qNHAustralia scored in the opening minute at the Sam Boyd Stadium when the Blitzboks defence did not react fast enough to a quick tap penalty from the Aussies.

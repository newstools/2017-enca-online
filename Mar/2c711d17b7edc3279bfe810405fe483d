JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters leader, Julius Malema says President Jacob Zuma must account for lying to Parliament.Malema was speaking after filing papers at the Constitutional Court, asking it to force Parliament to impeach the President. We hope that the Constitutional Court will accept our application, hear the matter and ultimately instruct parliament to hold some proceedings against President Zuma," Malema said to the media gathered outside court.The application aims to force National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete, to take action against Zuma."The proceedings are going to be necessary because once a process is established by Parliament, President Zuma is going to be called to appear before that process and is going to have to answer every single detail."It says this is a last resort for the party to hold the president accountable for the Nkandla debacle, and his repeated lies to parliament."That s when South Africans will get an opportunity to hear why Zuma made certain untruthful statements like he had a bond and all those types of things in parliament, Malema added.The EFF has noted that Friday, a year ago, the Constitutional Court handed down its Nkandla judgment.Tweets about #EFF AND (FROM:@SikiGeyaMdingi since:2017-03-30 until:2017-03-31) eNCA

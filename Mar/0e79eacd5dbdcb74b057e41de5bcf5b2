JOHANNESBURG Bidvest Wits put up a brave showing against 8-time continental league champions Al Ahly, before going down 1-0 in a CAF Champions League first round, first leg match played at the Al-Salam Stadium, in Cairo, on Saturday evening.Despite the score-line being level at half-time, Al Ahly did have the ball in the back of the visitors goal-net in the 20th minute, courtesy of attacking midfielder Moamen Zakaria, but the goal was disallowed due to an offside call by the match officials.After the first 45 minutes, in which the Wits defence in front of experienced goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs, did extremely well to see off several raids on the visiting team s danger area, Al-Ahly seemed to go up a gear in terms of momentum, and central defender Ahmed Hegazy headed the home side into the lead in the 57th minute, from a corner kick.In fact, the hosts could have gone into the lead just two minutes into the second half, but Al Ahly s speedy striker Amr Gamal watched in anguish as he shot hit the Wits cross bar and deflected away from danger.Al Ahly, who lead the Egyptian Premier League with 52 points from 20 matches, with four wins and a draw from their last five outings, lived up to their reputation of just how difficult they are to beat at home.With Wits looking for the equaliser, there was always a chance of the South Africans being caught on the counter attack, and goalkeeper Josephs did well to blunt several raids on his goal area by the Egyptian club during the final 30 minutes of play.Wits teenage midfielder Phakamani Mahlambi used the platform in the highest level of football company on the continent, to enhance his growing status with some quality passing, but Al Ahly s Egyptian international team goalkeeper Sherif Ekramy generally had a relatively trouble-free evening between the posts.Wits will return to SA, to prepare for another hectic week of football action. First up will be an away Nedbank Cup last 32 round encounter against Cape Town All Stars on Wednesday, before hosting Al Ahly in the home leg return fixture on Friday.African News Agency

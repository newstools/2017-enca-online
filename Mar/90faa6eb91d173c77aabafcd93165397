JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court has dismissed a case brought by the SABC eight, ruling that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the matter.The journalists had wanted the court to force parliament to set up a commission of inquiry into the public broadcaster.But the group said that it welcomed the ruling as, following the recommendations by Parliament s ad-hoc committee, it had planned to withdraw the case.The eight were fired in July after challenging an editorial policy preventing the broadcast of protest visuals.A high court judgment then forced the SABC to rehire them.eNCA

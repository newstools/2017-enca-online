Congrats boys! #ProteaFire #NZvSA pic.twitter.com/7xJwFgBCwOThe Proteas needed less than 33 overs to overhaul New Zealand's 149 with du Plessis ending the game with a boundary which also brought up his half century.The Black Caps innings folded at the start of their 42nd over and while South Africa lost early wickets in reply, du Plessis (51 not out) held the innings together with partnerships of 40 with AB de Villiers and an unbeaten 63 with David Miller.De Villiers' 23 was his lowest score and only the third time he was dismissed in the series where he averaged 87.33.But he was at the crease long enough to assist de Plessis in turning the innings around after South Africa, like New Zealand, started out losing wickets cheaply.

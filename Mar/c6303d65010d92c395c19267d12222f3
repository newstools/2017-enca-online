JOHANNESBURG - The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) on Friday accused President Jacob Zuma of rewarding mediocrity after he moved Faith Muthambi from the Communications Ministry to become the minister of public service and administration in a cabinet reshuffle that has drawn widespread criticism and condemnation.The affiliate of the Congress of SA Trade Union (Cosatu) said the move was ill-advised and defied logic .READ: Sadtu threatens to shut down Limpopo schools As a union that represents over 70 percent of education workers in this country, we have played our part over the last few years to help develop and sustain labour peace in the sector. We are thus shocked that against this background, the president appoints an individual who had spectacularly failed in her previous portfolio into the Public Service and Administration Department, the union said.We believe that by appointing an under-performing Minister,President has spit on the faces of all public servants #Muthabi @SA_Labour_News The decision by the president indicates that we have a government that rewards mediocrity and that there are no consequences for those who fail to deliver. The president through this bizarre decision has failed to show any appreciation and sensitivity for labour peace in the public service.He has essentially taken one of the worst-performing ministers in the current administration and given her the task to be one of the key drivers of the developmental state agenda, a task which she will most likely fail in given her dismal track record.

Clearly, the president, while exercising his prerogative, should have known that competence has to do with efficiency and effectiveness. The president in exercising his prerogative must always know that it also has to do with decency, respect and integrity.

JOHANNESBURG - The ANC and the portfolio committee on police noted the North Gauteng High Court judgment on the appointment of the Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI/Hawks), Berning Ntlemeza and provided reaction to the decision. The governing party stated that they respected the judgment. The effect of the judgment is to find Ntlemeza’s appointment unlawful and invalid. The ANC stated, "This judgment follows an admission made by the Minister of Police, Comrade Nathi Nhleko, to Parliament last year that an error had been made in the procedure followed to appoint General Ntlemeza. The ANC trusts therefore that today’s judgment brings this matter to finality."

The committee will be calling the minister of police to their special meeting to explain what remedial steps will be taken in dealing with the ruling, as well as plans to address deficiencies in the appointment process Beukman further said that it was imperative for the executive authority and the appointing authority to deal with the matter at hand as a matter of priority. “It is critical that the matter is addressed as a matter of priority, as we cannot allow a vacuum in the leadership of the DPCI,” said Beukman. The committee stated that they will be closely monitoring further developments in the case. eNCA

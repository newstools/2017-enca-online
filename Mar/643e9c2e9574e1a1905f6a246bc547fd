The policy that regulates allocation of houses and human settlements units to communities allocates these only to South African citizens and not foreign nationals. We know of beneficiaries who later sell their houses to foreign nationals. Where our people have knowledge of corruption they must give us evidence so that we can deal with this issue, said a statement issued by Gauteng Human Settlement on Thursday.#reigerpark resident - we are not going anywhere and if they touch us we going to moer them (police). pic.twitter.com/HrjcXG17OYProtesters gathered outside the Reiger Park police station, demanding the release of those who had been arrested while protesting.Police said no protesters had been arrested.The crowd later dispersed.Several roads and businesses remained closed on Thursday and police were monitoring the area.

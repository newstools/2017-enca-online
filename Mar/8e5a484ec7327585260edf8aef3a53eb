I don t think they have recovered, it s still a long way According to me, they no longer need social workers, they need help from psychiatric professionals, he said.On 17 October 2015, a group of eight men including Mduduzi Lawrence Mathibela (33), Edmore Ndlovu (24) and Thabo Nkala (26), accosted and robbed two couples who had been taking a stroll at Rhodes Park in Kensington.They have been found guilty of robbery, two counts of rape and two counts of murder.The trio has denied their involvement in the attack, despite the fact that CCTV footage showed them running from the park minutes after the incident. Only Mathibela s DNA was found on one of the victims which directly pinned him to the rape.The second witness to take the stand was a trauma specialist, Professor Malose Langa.Langa, who has been assessing the victims, told the court that the women have suffered severely because of the incident and will be forever tormented by the ordeal.He said one of the women is still angry and wished the perpetrators would die the same way they killed her husband.He explained that they were not likely to recover from the incident and still need therapy and medication.Langa said both women had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and were taking antidepressants. One of the women had to be given a stronger dosage because she wasn t coping and the medication was still not working.Judge Papi Masopa asked Langa if it was possible for the victims to recover. It s unfortunate memories will stay with them for their rest of their lives. Outside they look fine, but their souls have been damaged According to my opinion, they will never recover, their symptoms are severe, he said.The matter was adjourned until Wednesday afternoon when the state is expected to make final arguments for aggravation of sentence.

NEW YORK - Virtual rockers Gorillaz on Thursday announced a new album and previewed it with a track that merges rock, hip-hop and reggae alongside a trippy sci-fi video.The experimental side project of Damon Albarn of Blur fame -- which consists of a fictional band lineup represented by cartoons -- said that "Humanz," the group's first album since 2011, would come out on 28 April.Gorillaz said the group would play a release show on Friday in its home base of London, with tickets distributed to fans who pre-order the album and make a donation to the White Helmets, the volunteer rescue teams in Syria's brutal war."Humanz" will have guest stars on nearly every track including alternative hip-hop pioneers De La Soul and soul great Mavis Staples.The group released a new track from the album, "Saturnz Barz," that starts off with rapping by the Jamaican dancehall star Popcaan before taking on a dreamy but chaotic sound that merges electroclash and reggae.The video -- available on YouTube in 3D -- brings back the cartoon characters of Gorillaz as they explore a haunted house, whose attractions include a talking pizza slice.The "bassist" of Gorillaz, shaggy-haired Murdoc Niccals, then floats naked in space between a revolving Saturn and meteors.Since the 1990s, Albarn -- who duets with Popcaan on the song -- has been one of the leading lights of Britpop by fronting Blur but has pursued more eclectic styles with Gorillaz, a collaboration with comic book artist Jamie Hewlett."Saturnz Barz" is the second track released from "Humanz." On the eve of US President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the group unexpectedly released a trip-hop track called "Hallelujah Money."Featuring the Mercury Prize-winning singer Benjamin Clementine, "Hallelujah Money" takes aim at greed and "building walls" and features a video that mockingly features the elevator in the US leader's Trump Tower home.AFP

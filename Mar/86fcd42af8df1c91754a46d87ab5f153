POLOKWANE Top flight outfit Polokwane City outplayed ABC Motsepe League (Gauteng) side African All Stars 3-1 in a Nedbank Cup last 32 round match played at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Wednesday evening.The sides met in the first round of the same cup competition back in March last year, with two goals from striker Puleng Tlolane having been enough to secure a 2-0 score-line for the men from Limpopo. This time, Tlolane, added more pain for the Brakpan-based side, as he opened the scoring in the 24th minute of the first half.The second half goals for City came in the 72nd minute when Zambian defender Salulani Phiri blasted the ball home from around 30 metres out, and four minutes before the end of the match, when Zimbabwean striker Walter Musona, brother of former Kaizer Chiefs striker Knowledge Musona, scored.All Stars managed to pull a goal back, albeit from the penalty spot in the 90th minute, with Mohau Motaung slotting home the spot kick.The All Stars side, nicknamed Amazozo , gave a good account of themselves against their professional club opponents, and certainly did not look like a side that is languishing in 10th place on the ABC Motsepe League (Gauteng) log with 30 points from 26 matches.Likewise, City, who have earned the tag of the draw kings of the Absa Premiership, having produced a stalemate result in 11 of their 20 matches played this season, will have been happy to taste victory for the first time in 2017. The Rise and Shine team, as City are known, have drawn all five of their league matches played this year with the last four having been with 1-all score-lines.Going into the cup match without injured leading goal-scorer Rodney Ramalaglela, gave Tlolane an opportunity to show his worth with his first half strike being his first goal since getting on the score-sheet in the 3-2 league loss to Kaizer Chiefs back on December 18. City coach Luc Eymael will be hoping that the winning feeling will stick in the minds of his players, as they prepare for a tough league encounter against African champions Mamelodi Sundowns in Tshwane next Tuesday.African News Agency

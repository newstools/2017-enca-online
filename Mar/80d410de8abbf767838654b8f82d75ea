JOHANNESBURG The SA Under-20 men s team lost 1-0 to Zambia in the first CAF Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations semi-final of the at Heroes National Stadium on Wednesday night. A goal by Edward Chilufya in extra time separated the two southern African nations in what was always going to be a close affair in a packed stadium. The match was finally decided by a strike in the second half of extra time after the two sides had battled for 90 minutes without a goal. The match produced some breathtaking football in which both sides created some gilt-edged chances and the late goal was gut-wrenching for South Africa who produced some exiting football throughout the match. The Young Chipolopolo had the majority of the chances in the opening exchanges, but Amajita goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto was the difference as he made numerous saves throughout the match. Congratulations to Zambia, they gave us a run for our money. We always expected a tough match and we are very proud that we managed to keep a clean sheet for the whole 90 minutes. We are impressed with the character showed by the boys despite the loss, said Amajita coach Thabo Senong. Amajita will now wait for the second semi-final of the CAF Under-20 African Cup of Nations which will be played on Thursday between Guinea and Senegal in Ndola. The loser of that encounter will face South Africa in the 3rd/ 4th place play off while the winner will play Zambia to determine the champions on Sunday.African News Agency

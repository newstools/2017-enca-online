PRETORIA Companies dealing with cargo containing valuables at airports should have their own security measures in place, in addition to those provided by the SA Police Service (SAPS) and the Airports Company of South Africa, Acsa CEO Bongani Maseko said.He said although cargo security was a collective responsibility, cargo operators were the only ones who knew what was being transported and should take additional measures. We encourage cargo companies, especially those who deal with valuables such as cellphones, computers, cash and so on, to have their own security programmes. We emphasise the fact that it cannot be left solely to the SAPS and Acsa to provide security, Maseko told reporters at a briefing on Thursday.READ: Uninsured FNB heist victims must waitOR Tambo International Airport had a security forum that included the airlines, police, Acsa and other parties operating at the national key point, he said. The forum met frequently to evaluate and respond to possible security threats.The robbery on Tuesday evening saw vehicles occupied by several armed men, some of whom were in police uniforms, access a restricted area of the airport.When asked to validate their credentials, the men produced firearms, rounded up staff at the security checkpoint and ordered them to lie on the floor, according to Acsa.The group then proceeded to gain access to the air-side of the airport where they removed an undisclosed amount of money from a sealed container. No shots were fired or injuries reported.A reported R24-million was stolen during the brazen robbery.Two vehicles with police markings and blue lights used in the robbery were reportedly found abandoned in Pretoria on Wednesday.

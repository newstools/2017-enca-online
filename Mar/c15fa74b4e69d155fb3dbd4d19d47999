NAIROBI Kenya is to face International Olympic Committee (IOC) sanctions following its failure to approve and sign a new constitution, after voting against it on Tuesday.The National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) has been in crisis since Kenyan Sports Minister Hassan Wario disbanded it, after a number of problems with the handling of logistics for the Kenyan contingent at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.At a special general meeting last week, members of NOCK were asked to approve a series of new regulations addressing issues of good governance.However, political in-fighting caused a postponement.READ: Kenya s Jemima Sumgong sets record in Brazilian road racePere Mir , IOC deputy director-general, and Lassana Palenfo, president of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA), warned that action would be taken should NOCK not approve the new constitution.The IOC and ANOCA called on NOCK to show responsibility and act constructively to conclude the process by 7 March.A meeting was held yesterday at which representatives of the IOC and ANOCA were present.However, a vote of 19-13 vote against approval of the new IOC constitution occurred. A two-thirds majority was required for the constitution to be approved.Consequently, the IOC executive board may sanction Kenya during its meeting in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on 16 and 17 March.Suspension of Kenya from the IOC would send shock waves through world sport, but it is a possibility at this point.This dire state of affairs appears to have come about because Kenyan sports officials fear a loss of power, demonstrating ulterior motives in a case where perspective is needed.The draft constitution was controversial as it pledged to strip NOCK Executive Committee members of their voting power. A change to this system would make it difficult for incumbent members to retain power.However, governing bodies affiliated to NOCK all backed the new document, in the greater interest of Kenyan sport and its participants in international competitions.Olympic sport, particularly track and field, is one of the greatest symbols of success for the Kenyan nation and its people. The performances of Kenyan stars, like 800m world-record holder David Rudisha, inspire young Kenyans and Africans in general. African News Agency

HO CHI MINH CITY Film buffs with the hottest ticket in town were left running for safety after a giant model of King Kong went up in flames at the sizzling Vietnam premiere of the rebooted horror classic.The blaze began as a glamorous announcer welcomed communist party officials, diplomats and celebrities to the screening of Kong: Skull Island in Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday night.But the razz-matazz soon gave away to farce as a blaze apparently started by a torch discarded by a fire dancer consumed the over-sized primate in minutes.The fire tore through the 5m-high model, sending filmgoers scurrying for cover as flames burned demon-like through King Kong's eyes.The only injuries caused by the fire were to the model of the giant ape and the pride of event organisers, as video of the fiasco went viral.

They must work on what we have agreed, and pay people on the date."Talking to the country and answering questions is not helping. In fact it helps to fertilise the situation where people are speculating, said Zuma.Zuma explained that he summoned the Social Development and Finance Ministers to explain how they were handling the grant crisis, as he was due to leave the country."I wanted to be more certain whilst I'd been briefed but because of the speculation I thought it was important to meet the ministers to make sure and to give the necessary instructions that, on the first, old people must be paid their pensions.""There is no way that a country can fail to pay its pensioners, and I would suggest for the nation should really calm down and wait for that date."I think you can say there's a crisis if after the first nobody's paid. People say there's a crisis when there's no crisis," he said.WATCH: Politicians bickering with journalists - an overviewZuma has called for calm on the matter."It s unfortunate that people have been going ahead of events they will get their pay and the country must not take this matter as if a problem has arisen."eNCA

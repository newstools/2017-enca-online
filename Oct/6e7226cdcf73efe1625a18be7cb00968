WASHINGTON - Online retailer Amazon has withdrawn its sale of a Halloween costume representing Oscar Pistorius. The costume was a green sleeveless shirt and shorts and bootcovers to represent his blades and was sold for £26.10 (R467). The words 'Blade Gunner' are emblazoned on the front of the shirt. Daily Mail reported that an Amazon spokesperson said the product "is no longer available". Pistorius was sentenced to six years behind bars for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp. Earlier this month, Carl Pistorius said legal action will be taken against a movie that ‘grossly misrepresents’ his brother. WATCH: Trailer for Oscar Pistorius movie The film, titled Oscar Pistorius: Blade Runner Killer, is due for release in the United States on 11 November. It's not the first time that costumes for Halloween, a major US festival celebrated on 31 October, have sparked controversy. Two years ago, US retailers Wal-Mart and eBay withdrew an Israeli soldier's outfit and an "Arab" nose after criticism. And this week retailers have withdrawn from sale a costume representing the clothes of Anne Frank, the celebrated Jewish teen who died in a Nazi concentration camp. For $25 (excluding shipping), "your child can play the role of a World War II hero on Halloween," said an ad for the costume. - Additional reporting AFP eNCA

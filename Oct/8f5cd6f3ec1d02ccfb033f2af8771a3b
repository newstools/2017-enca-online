CAPE TOWN - Archbishop Emeritus, Desmond Tutu was honoured on his 86th birthday with a symbolic gift with a fitting name. The Arch for Arch monument was commissioned by the Design Indaba in collaboration with international and local artists. The structure, which is situated between the St Georges Cathedral and Parliament in Cape Town, serves as a reminder of the Archbishop’s dedication to democracy. It’s not just a piece of art but a symbolic reflection of the country’s history and the legacy of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. According to Ravi Naidoo of the Design Indaba, "This was a project that came out of a talk in Design indaba with a very famous architectural practice called Snøhetta in Oslo, put together with a South African practice in Braamfontein to conceptualise the idea. In Europe we have there these significant arches that celebrate victory over war. We have gad a victory as well, but it stopped short of war. Pragmatic leaders like Archbishop Tutu prevented that outcome." The monument’s location is also significant, according to Naidoo. "The Arch conceptually is a very powerful symbol. It’s really an arch that sits between two very significant place, St Georges cathedral behind me and Parliament. It’s the man of the book, in terms of Archbishop Tutu and it also celebrates the other book, that which  legislates our country being the constitution." Naidoo says the arches are a metaphor representing the strength of South Africa’s Constitution. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG -Legal expert Pierre de Vos says it's hard to predict the court's decision regarding the state capture case. President Jacob Zuma's challenge to the State of Capture report is expected to be heard in the high court in Pretoria from Tuesday. Zuma contends that he, and not the chief justice, should appoint the judge to lead a commission of inquiry into state capture.  De Vos says he wouldn’t be surprised if the North Gauteng High Court ruled in Zuma's favour. READ: State capture and beyond "This case is very specific in a sense that it says the president cannot appoint the commission of inquiry because he is completely conflicted. He would be required to appoint the commission of inquiry to establish whether he is corrupt or not. So the perception that commission is that that commission of inquiry will be biased and will have no credibility and confliction then," De Vos says. "There are two principles that are in direct conflict with one another. One, the president must appoint the commission. The other one that the president cannot appoint in this case because he is completely conflicted. But I would not be surprised if the court rules in favour of the president in this case. But you know it is always a dicey thing to predict what our courts will find." eNCA

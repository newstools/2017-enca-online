JOHANNESBURG - The Cape Peninsula University of Technology has beefed up security following clashes at its Bellville campus. Two students have been arrested after run-ins with private security and police on Wednesday night. Students are protesting over financial exclusion. Further damage was caused at the Bellville admin building when clashes between private security and students brokeout. IN PICTURES: CPUT on protest alert “A group of in the region of 100 to 200 students who had been grouping from about 8pm. We then believe that they then started stoning the admin building. The damage was limited, thanks to the proactive response of the private security on the day," said Lauren Kansley, CPUT Spokesperson. The university says its doors are open to discuss students concerns. But students, on the other hand, say the institution’s management refuses to engage with them. They say they’ll continue to mobilise more students to join the movement. CPUT has deployed additional security at its main campuses. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The International Space Station will pass over Gauteng at about 6.52pm on Tuesday, according to astronomer Claire Flanagan. NASA says the station "looks like a fast-moving plane only much higher and traveling thousands of miles an hour faster!" Flanagan said people should look for a very bright star rising from the horizon in the northwest and travelling for about four minutes overhead. Although the station -- the only satellite with people living and working onboard -- passed over South Africa every six weeks or so, it would be particularly bright on Tuesday, she said. The ISS orbits at a speed of about 27,600km an hour -- or 7.66km a second -- about 350km to 400km above Earth.

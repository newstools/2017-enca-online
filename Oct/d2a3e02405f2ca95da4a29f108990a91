JOHANNESBURG - ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe says the party's problem is not its processes but members' desire to hold power. Mantashe was speaking on radio station 702 about the ANC's readiness for the December elective conference. The ANC has seen some of its provinces involved in litigious processes, an issue Mantashe says speaks more to individual's need for power.

If my faction doesn't succeed in winning a conference, I must appeal it and take it to court,"  he said. He saw this as a manifestation of the replacement of commitment by greed and this needed to be addressed. Despite all this, the ANC secretary-general is adamant that all will be sorted out on 15 November, when branch audits will be finalised, and that the conference on 16 December will go ahead as planned.  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – A large portion of the greater Soweto area will experience water outages for nearly three days, the City of Johannesburg confirmed on Monday. This is due to a pipeline causing leakages, leaving the council with no choice but to replace it. “The previous inlet pipeline caused regular leakages and reached the point where it could no longer be repaired. As such, Johannesburg Water replaced the pipeline and must now connect it to the existing pipeline next to the Zondi reservoir.” the city said in a statement.

JOHANNESBURG – All matriculants who arrived late for exams on Monday due to #BlackMonday marches were allowed into exam rooms at different centres across Gauteng, the MEC for education, Panyaza Lesufi said. The provincial department of education said concessions were made for those who arrived late into exam venues including those who arrived after the one-hour cut-off. Lesufi said some learners were even allowed to write at alternative centres. For those who could not make it to exam venues, the department said arrangements will be made and they will only be tested early next year.  READ: #BlackMonday protesters block highways in Gauteng, Western Cape Lesufi said it's in the department's best interests not to disadvantage pupils over a situation beyond their control. The department said it can't make special arrangements for pupils affected because this might compromise the credibility of the exams. “We don’t want a process whereby there’s an element of cheating, there’s an element of irregularity in our exams…those learners who will not make it, unfortunately, they’ll have to write next year during the supplementary process which is in February. This is where this march has caused us dearly,” said the department’s spokesperson, Steve Mabona. eNCA

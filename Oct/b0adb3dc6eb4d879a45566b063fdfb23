JOHANNESBURG – Banyana Banyana continued their winning form, beating Burkina Faso 4 – 0 at the Dobsonville Stadium. It was South Africa’s first match since winning last month’s Cosafa Cup, and their first home fixture this year. Banyana could have scored more goals, as they created numerous chances in the game. The interim national women’s team coach, Desiree Ellis, “I thought we didn’t play that well, especially the first half, but the second half was much better. Happy with the result though, always good if you don’t have a good game to get a positive result, which we did, so soon after Cosafa.” READ: Sasol pumping incentives for Banyana Banyana players “Still a lot of hard work ahead. Finishing – huge problem still at the moment, lack of composure is not something you can teach, but we always will create, we just will continue working on finishing so that we can hit the target or convert more often than not” Banyana Banyana striker, Thembi Kgatlana said that the sooner they scored, the better because all the nerves they all had during the match. “All the pressure gets off us, and you could see that after scoring that goal we struggled a bit until we got that second goal, and also coming back into the second half, me scoring those two goals made things easier." This international friendly match against Burkina Faso at the Dobsonville Stadium means that the chosen player will pocket R10 000. The incentive follows Sasol renewing their partnership for a further four years with the South African Football Association (SAFA) just a few weeks ago. eNCA

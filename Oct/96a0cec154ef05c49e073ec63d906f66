CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA)'s Western Cape elective conference got off to a shaky start. Fireworks intended for the extravagant entrance of party leader Mmusi Maimane triggered the venue's fire sprinkler system, which then led to a power failure. Maimane started his party's Western Cape elective conference with a tribute to MP Tarnia Baker. She died after being hit by a truck while crossing the road at a traffic intersection in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday.  Maimane emphasised the importance of growing rural economies.  Maimane was talking tough about race at the party’s Western Cape elective conference.  Maimane says political grandstanding shouldn’t get in the way of making townships safer.
	Maimane was talking about the killings at the Marikana informal settlement in Philippi, where over 20 people have been murdered recently.  Bonginkosi Madikizela was elected as the party's new Western Cape leader, with Anton Bredel elected as provincial chairperson. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The constitutionality of the terrorism act in the trial of the terror accused twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie continued to be an issue on Friday at the Johannesburg High Court. The duo was arrested in July 2016 for being suspected of plotting terrorist attacks on various Jewish institutions and individuals, as well as attempting to join ISIL. Defence attorney Annelene Van Den Heever told Judge Raylene Keightley that she was in discussions with an attorney in a similar case who would provide them with papers to gauge how their matter was dealt with. “We were of the opinion to serve our paper on the application end of January,” Van Den Heever said.

Van Den Heever requested that the matter be heard around Wednesday, 31 January. State prosecutor Chris MacAdam said any challenge to the constitution would require the police to be present in order for them to see the application and determine who was suitable to argue the matter. “The court doesn’t want it to remain vage,” Judge Keightley added. MacAdam said that all the State’s documents had been filed. “It mustn’t hold up the trial and we must get moving,” Keightley said. MacAdam mentioned to the court that he was informed that the Judge President said leg irons had to be worn by accused in custody. This follows the defence requesting that the leg irons be taken off the twins at their previous appearance in court. Judge Keightley said she needed facts on the safety measures in writing as it was in everyone’s interest as her office had also been security swept ahead of the trial. “We don’t want a perception that our clients are dangerous when that is not the case,” Van Den Heever added. The matter was postponed to December 12 for continuation of the pretrial proceedings. African News Agency

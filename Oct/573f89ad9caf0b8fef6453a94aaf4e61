KWAZULU-NATAL - KwaZulu-Natal ANC Deputy Secretary Mluleki Ndobe says his party is considering providing security for its councillors in the Richmond Municipality. Since the 2016 local government elections, three councillors have been murdered in Richmond. “We have assured the candidate as well as the community that we will continue to work with the law enforcement agencies to make sure that there is peace and stability, but if needs be because of the Cred assessment that we are going to do, we will provide a protection if that is necessary,” says Ndobe. A by-election is being held there on Wednesday after the brutal killing of the previous ward councillor. Over 5,000 registered voters are expected to cast their votes in the third by-election in Richmond since the local government elections. Only three political parties are contesting - the ANC, the IFP and the EFF. Voting stations close early Wednesday evening and results are expected later on Wednesday night. eNCA

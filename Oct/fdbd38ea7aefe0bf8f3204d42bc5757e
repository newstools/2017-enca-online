JOHANNESBURG – Banyana Banyana players will be smiling all the way to the bank after sponsor Sasol has introduced a monetary incentive to go with the Diski Queen of the Match (Player of the Match) award. Starting with the upcoming international friendly match against Burkina Faso at the Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday, the chosen player will pocket R10 000. The incentive follows Sasol renewing their partnership for a further four years with the South African Football Association (SAFA) just a few weeks ago. SAFA has welcomed the move. “Women’s Football is one of our major priorities in the Association, and we will do everything in our power to ensure they get the recognition they deserve. We would therefore like to thank Sasol for their never-ending support they provide to the game, which in turn pushes them into winners as we saw when they won the COSAFA Cup recently. We believe this incentive will go a long way in making the players feel valued,” said SAFA CEO Dennis Mumble.

We congratulate them and remain firmly behind them as we offer our support because we see ourselves more than a sponsor but a partner who is there to rally the team and encourage them to make sure they always get the success they deserve.” African News Agency

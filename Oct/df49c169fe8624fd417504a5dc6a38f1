JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency has confirmed a meeting took place with SABC staff on Monday. Spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said working relations between the SABC and the Presidency were discussed. The DA claims President Jacob Zuma summoned the public broadcaster's staff to his office in Pretoria,Â calling the meeting highly irregular as the SABC doesn't report to the President.

But Ngqulunga says the President was not even aware of the meeting. He says the Presidency regularly meets with journalists from all media groups. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - International beauty and personal care product, Dove, manufactured by Unilever, has been slammed for a racist advert, which it has subsequently pulled.  In the advert, a black woman is shown changing her t-shirt, emerging as a white woman, after using Dove lotion.  Dove: with one quarter moisturising cream... can't cleanse racism. pic.twitter.com/7M7dO7DgOG Minister of Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthetwa joined the chorus of voices slamming Dove for its racial insensitivity on Sunday.  We strongly condemn this racist campaign by @Dove & note with concern that this is not the first time they've been called out for racism. pic.twitter.com/28FEazUprx I haven't seen this advert but, apart from being racist, what does it even mean? That by using Dove you wash away your identity?  Dove has pulled the advert and issued an apology, but social media users say this is not good enough.  An image we recently posted on Facebook missed the mark in representing women of color thoughtfully. We deeply regret the offense it caused. This is not the first time Dove has raised racial ires with its advertising.  Previously, it ran an advertisement showing women of different colour that created the suggestion white women were clear than balck women.  Dove is a problem. You’d have think they’d have learnt from the last time (L). The one on the right is a newer advert from #Dove. pic.twitter.com/jCc4i37GBF Missed the mark? You clearly knew the message you wanted to send. This is horrible and so is your "apology." pic.twitter.com/NSN59mmOqx eNCA

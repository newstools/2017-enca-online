PARIS - Roger Federer has closed the gap on Rafael Nadal at the top of the latest ATP world rankings released on Monday following his victory over the Spaniard at the Shanghai Masters. Nadal remains well clear of Federer, but the Swiss maintains a chance of finishing the year as world number one after shaving more than 400 points off his lead. Federer claimed a surprisingly one-sided 6-4, 6-3 victory over the world number one on Sunday to secure a 94th career title, drawing him level with the great Ivan Lendl.

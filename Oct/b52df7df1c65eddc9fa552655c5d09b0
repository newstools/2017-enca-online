JOHANNESBURG – Platinum Stars coach Roger De Sa wants his men to build on their performances against Orlando Pirates in order to overcome Free State Stars on Saturday (start 8.15pm). On Wednesday night that Dikwena drew 1-1 with Pirates, De Sa couldn’t fault his men for effort, commitment or fighting spirit.  Dikwena were quick to equalize as Bongi Ntuli cancelled Thabo Matlaba’s opener two minutes after Dikwena went a goal down.  READ: Pirates and Platinum Stars share spoils in premiership clash Though Dikwena are yet to register their first win, De Sa is confident that his charges are going in the right direction. “We showed glimpses of improvement in certain areas. Hopefully, we can carry on building from this,” said De Sa, who was heartened by his men’s showings on Wednesday night. “It was always going to be a tough one. We knew that. Coming here was never going to be easy. Pirates are a team in construction. You can see that they are a new side, a lot of new players and a new coach. We have been watching and we could see that it was going to be difficult with a lot of pace and mobility.” De Sa was delighted to see Ntuli get on the score sheet. His view is that the goal will inspire the marksman and his teammates to score on regular basis. READ: Platinum Stars club for sale? Rumours settled “Ntuli’s goal is a massive plus for us. He hasn’t scored in months. For him to get a goal,  we played friendly games and I chose to play teams from Vodacom League and ABC Motsepe League to try to get his confidence and he was missing from two meters,” said De Sa. Dikwena’s next assignment is away to Free State Stars this coming Saturday. De Sa will be crossing his fingers that Ntuli and company carry with their scoring boots as they go in search of a win at Goble Park. “We have got to keep on working. Hopefully, we can get something out of the game on the weekend,” said De Sa. African News Agency

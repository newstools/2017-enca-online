JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (ANA) – Nine people have been injured in two separate crashes in the Johannesburg area overnight, paramedics said on Sunday. A minibus taxi driver, believed to be in his 20s, was seriously injured when his taxi overturned on Snake Road underneath the N12 bridge in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said. ER24 paramedics, along with the fire services, arrived on the scene to find the taxi on its side on the opposite side of the road. The driver was found trapped inside the taxi, he said. Rescue services had to use various rescue tools to free the man from the minibus. Once freed, paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained a serious injury to his arm, leaving him in a serious condition. He was treated for his injuries and provided with pain-relief medication before he was transported to Tambo Memorial Hospital for further treatment. In a separate crash, eight people were injured, some seriously, when a bakkie and car collided on the N1 south highway in Buccleuch, Johannesburg, Meiring said. ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene and found a bakkie on its side in the middle of the road while the car had come to a stop a short distance away. “Several people that had been travelling on the back of the bakkie were found seated around their vehicle. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that eight people, including two children, had sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious.” They were treated for their injuries and the seriously injured provided with pain-relief medication before they were transported to Busamed and Helen Joseph hospitals for further care. Local authorities were investigating both incidents, Meiring said. African News Agency

CAPE TOWN - A request to deploy members of the South African Defence Force to help police quell violence in crime hot spots was being processed by the Presidency, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula told Parliament on Tuesday. Briefing Parliament’s portfolio committee on police, Mbalula explained that the defence force would not do the work of police but rather act as reinforcement. “We are responding to an alarming situation with regard to our communities where there are violent acts undertaken by violent criminals,” he said. “This is not a static, permanent stationing of the defence force to do police work. We are looking at tactical deployments and them [the SANDF] being led by the South African Police Service.” WATCH: 'Our station level must ensure we're felt in communities': Mbalula Mbalula said the decision to deploy would have to come from President Jacob Zuma. “The president will give us the go-ahead once he has actually cleared the matter with himself and people who advise him.” Mbalula said that, if approved, the defence force would be deployed to hotspots in Gauteng, Western Cape and Kwazulu-Natal.

JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula has defended his comments made to the controversial amaBerete police unit. The minister instructed members of the anti-crime unit to squeeze the criminals and crush their balls. According to Mbalula, "It is figurative speech, if you squeeze the balls, you know you play with balls, you squeeze them you know. You squeeze them because you want to squeeze the ball. Now the judge can’t judge what I am saying, he can't judge what I'm saying." Mbalula says he was referring to sport balls and not genitalia.  Mbalula on Friday announced the appointment of former Judge President Frans Kgomo, to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against the Hawks. The minister says the judge’s appointment will ensure the Hawks, which has been embroiled in a series of political scandals, is held accountable. Mbalula denies that his language will drive violence among police officers. BALLS

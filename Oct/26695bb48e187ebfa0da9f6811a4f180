PRETORIA – The Presidency has announced that Advocate Thomas Bongo will be sworn in as a minister on Wednesday. The new State Security minister was appointed to the national executive on Tuesday morning after President Jacob Zuma announced a cabinet reshuffle. READ: New cabinet ministers already mired in controversy The relatively unknown politician, who is from Mpumalanga and has been an ANC MP since 2014, takes over from David Mahlobo who is now the Energy Minister. He has no previous executive experience but has served on various parliamentary committees, including the one tasked with nominating a new public protector in 2016. The Presidency also informed that already-serving ministers will not be sworn in again as they took the oath of office when they were first appointed as either ministers or deputy ministers during the previous term.

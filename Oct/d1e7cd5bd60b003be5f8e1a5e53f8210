NORTHAM, Limpopo - The slogan at the annual Oppikoppi music festival is usually “In dust we trust” since whatever happens at Oppi, you can rest assured it’s going to be dusty and dry. This year, for the first time, Oppi saw torrential rain and even hail, with no one being spared. Rain affected the festival so badly that roads used to leave the venue were unsafe to drive on and revellers who wanted to leave early were advised to sit tight for the night. The theme for this year’s event (the 23rd) is OK23: Me now, the Mango Picker. You can view a gallery of pics from Oppikoppi in the image box above. eNCA

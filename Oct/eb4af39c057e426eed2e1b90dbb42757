DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal is holding a press briefing to outline the outcome of the PEC. The members will also reflect on key political developments in the province and the country. The party asked for leave to appeal a high court ruling that nullified the 2015 elective conference results. The Pietermaritzburg High Court declared the conference unlawful and void. The ruling raises questions about the leadership of the governing party in the province. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Karabo Mokoena was trying to start a foundation for abused women and children in the days before she was brutally murdered. Now, almost six months after her death, Karabo’s friends and family have launched that foundation. The foundation’s aims include getting women out of abusive relationships safely. Karabo’s ex-boyfriend Sandile Mantsoe, is accused of killing her, after allegedly beating her for months. EXCLUSIVE: Sandile Mantsoe: scam artist? Bontle Mokoena, Karabo's sister, says: “I get emotional because I think about the dreams that my little sister had starting a foundation and really bringing an impact in a woman’s life…this is honestly to honour her and the women who have been abused.” Bontle says since her sister’s death, she's been contacted by abuse survivors – one of whom she helped get out of an abusive marriage. It was this experience, she says, that made her realise a small act of kindness can be life-changing. Sandile Mantsoe will go on trial for Karabo Mokoena’s murder in March next year. Those who love her are hoping the terrible way in which her life ended, will not define her legacy.

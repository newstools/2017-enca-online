WATCH: Blade Nzimande: 'SA is not for sale' “If we don't combat the violence that is widespread in our communities, it's will further plunge our country into a crisis.” Nzimande also spoke against the so-called political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The firebrand critic of the ANC, said these killings as being sugar-coated. “We had comrades being killed in Inchanga, these killings are called political killings but in actual fact it's criminal elements. It's criminals who are killing us to attain political power,” he said. ANC internal politics also featured in his address, with Nzimande hitting out at those who say the SACP must not get involved in the governing party's problems. “Those who tell us not to speak about the ANC want to steal it, they must know that about the party because it's doesn't only represent its members but it also represents society.” Nzimande said the communists will not stay silent when wrongs are committed in their name eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Officials are leaving no stone unturned regarding the issue of spectator safety ahead of this Saturday’s Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium. Special measures with the sale of tickets have been put in place for the much anticipated Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates clash. Two supporters died during the last Soweto Derby in July at the Carling Black Label Cup. There was a stampede after fans, many of whom were without tickets, tried to force their way in the stadium. VIDEO: Footage emerges of FNB stampede Stadium Management say they have learnt from that incident. Tickets will not be sold on match day and they will be checking tickets at a distance away from the turnstiles going into the stadium. “Our idea is to get people as far away from the turnstiles checking their tickets so that when you get close to the stadium and to the turnstiles we know all those people have legitimate tickets in their hands and they will scan themselves into the stadium so that’s the biggest change we have made to our security planning,” says Jacques Grobbelaar, Stadium Management CEO. The constant problem of fans arriving late was yet again witnessed during the Mamelodi Sundowns vs Kaizer Chiefs match at Loftus Versfeld Stadium. The match had to be delayed by 30 minutes due to fans still being outside at kick-off time. “This is a 90,000 seater stadium and compare that with Loftus stadium, this is twice Loftus Versfeld and you bring in 90,000 people into a 500 square meter facility so you cannot wait till 3pm and then decide you going to rock up at a stadium, that causes issues," says Grobbelaar.  Fans are again urged not to buy fake tickets and arrive in time to enter the ground. Gates open at 11:30am with kick-off at 3:30pm.

CAPE TOWN – The Public Investment Corporation (PIC), one of Africa's largest asset managers, has not ruled out investing in struggling state-owned airline the South African Airways, its chief executive said on Tuesday. "We are not closing the door on SAA," CEO Dan Matjila told parliament's finance committee, adding that SAA would first need to improve governance and implement a turnaround strategy before being considered. The PIC manages government’s employee retirement funds and has been in the spotlight recently after reports the finance ministry requested money from the pension fund to bail out struggling state firms.

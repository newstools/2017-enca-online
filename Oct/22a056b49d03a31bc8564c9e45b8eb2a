RUSTENBURG – A 46-year-old man, accused of killing Blydeville teenager, Spencer Tshukudu, and injuring two others, was granted bail of R20,000 in the Lichtenburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Jaco du Plooy from the Rietfontein farm told the court at an earlier appearance, that he fired several shots into a group of people to protect himself and his workers on October 10. “We were in great danger. My employees jumped out (of a van) and ran for their lives. I fired several shots in defence. They had stones and rocks (and) they were attacking us,” he said in an affidavit read by his lawyer Peet du Plessis.

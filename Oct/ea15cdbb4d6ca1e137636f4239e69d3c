JOHANNESBURG - ANC voters are calling on the party to move with the times and not to solely cling onto its history. This has emerged from 16 focus groups of ANC voters in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape. The research suggests that the party needs to evolve, and not constrain itself to the wisdom and legacy of struggle stalwarts. The ANC is going through difficult times, with many calling on the president to step down. Some supporters say the ANC’s achievements in government leaves much to be desired.  READ: The Race: ANC supporters want leaders they can trust Political analyst Dr Mcebisi Ndletyana believes the ANC needs to address current issues facing the people. “People don’t live in the past, they live in the present so you need to constantly renew your leadership. You need to convince them on why you need to be a leader. Leadership is not handed over in perpetuity because of what you did 20 years ago but it’s the here and now, what have you done for me lately as the Americans say. So it’s important therefore to adapt to the present , to speak to current,” he says. Ndtleyana says that the liberation movement must realise that its historical currency to get votes is running out. “If the ANC were to learn to do that and realise that the currency of the past is fast running out and people are evaluating them on what they are doing now in wards, realise on history leads to complacency, that’s the major downfall of the ANC, to much reliance on the history , they must realise that they are living in the present and they must justify on them being elected into office on the basis of what they do here and now,” says Ndletyana. The ANC Youth League echoes the sentiments of those interviewed, calling for a generational mix at the national elective conference in December. eNCA

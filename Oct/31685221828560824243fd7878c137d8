JOHANNESBURG - The SA Communist Party has accused Luthuli House of being behind the arrest of the SACP's top official in uMzimkhulu, KwaZulu-Natal. The man, who is also a senior ANC official, was arrested on Saturday for possession of an unlicensed firearm.

She said his colleagues had later tried to present the document at a police station but had been told that Luthuli House, the ANC headquarters, had ordered that he be kept in custody. The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal refused on Sunday to comment on the SACP accusation. Twenty-four councillors have been killed in KwaZulu-Natal since 2009 and the SACP claims that competition for tenders is fuelling the violence. More than 60 people have been arrested in connection with the murders, but none has been successfully prosecuted yet. eNCA

DURBAN – Although Durban and the rest of the KZN coast are experiencing strong south-westerly winds at the moment, current conditions are not expected to worsen and are typical conditions that the area might expect to experience on a weekly or fortnightly basis. This is according to eNCA metereologist Luis Fernandes, who says the South African Weather Service has issued a watch for possible gales on that stretch of the coastline, but this does not mean that they are expected, just that they would be possible. "There is only one cold front expected to brush over the area today and it is fairly weak and also very typical for this area," says Fernandes. "No heavy rain or severe thunderstorm activity is indicated or expected for anywhere in the country for today. Durban and surrounds will get some light rain tonight and tomorrow with only a few millimeters likely." Earlier, the eThekwini Municipality warned Durban residents of two approaching cold fronts, just days after a devastating one wreaked havoc in the city.  #WEATHER WARNING: Two imminent cold fronts approaching Durban today, 12 October 2017.

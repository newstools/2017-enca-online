JOHANNESBURG - The JSE opened firmer on Friday‚ with retailers and banks attempting a tentative recovery as the market followed upbeat Asian markets on a strong close from the Dow and as the rand retreated further. Local interest-rate sensitive stocks were hammered on Thursday following Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s disastrous medium-term budget on Wednesday‚ while rand hedges benefited from the weaker rand. Naspers led industrials at the opening‚ hitting another record as Google parent Alphabet‚ Amazon and Microsoft surged in Asian trade after reporting strong quarterly growth.

This means the ECB will not increase interest rates for the next nine months‚ providing a gap for the dollar to benefit from an expected rate hike in December in the US. Although eurozone economic growth remains robust‚ the ECB still forecasts inflation for 2019 at just 1.5%‚ considerably below its medium-term target. “Therefore we think that continued monetary accommodation through 2018 remains appropriate‚” Barclays Research analysts said. Global currencies usually react positively to higher interest rates in risk-off trade.

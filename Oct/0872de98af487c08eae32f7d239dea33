JOHANNESBURG - The greatest sprinter of all time, Usain Bolt, has backed Baroka FC goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke to win the coveted Puskás Award for the best goal of the 2016/2017 season. The world record holder in the men’s 100m and 200m was impressed by the sublime strike by Masuluke which has been nominated for the award. READ: Baroka’s Masuluke nominated for FIFA goal of the year “I’d vote for Oscarine Masuluke. For a goalkeeper to score an overhead kick in stoppage time like that is impressive,” said Bolt on FIFA.com. The goalkeeper scored a last minute equaliser in Baroka’s Premier Soccer League game against Pirates at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in November 2016. Masuluke produced a moment of magic as he pulled off an overhead bicycle kick from the edge of the area as the entire Baroka team pushed upfield in search of an equaliser. African News Agency

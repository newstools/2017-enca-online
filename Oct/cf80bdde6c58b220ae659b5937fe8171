JOHANNESBURG - Political analyst, Ralph Mathekga says disgruntled ANC branch members are likely to head to court when they fail to agree on candidates to send to the December elective conference. READ: ANC allocates delegate numbers for elective conference Mathekga was speaking on the eNCA programme PolitBureau.  According to him, “If you can’t get the credentials right, if you can’t agree on who is the rightful delegate to come to the conference, anything that follows from there can therefore be challenged because it means you are then looking at the legitimacy of the people that have been sent. It is where usually the battle regarding these conferences are concentrated. It is the same thing  at provincial level, you see it at regional level, it is going to be compounded to get to the elective conference in December.” One political analyst believes the ANC could be collapsing. WATCH: Chairs fly, police shoot rubber bullets at ANC EC conference He believes the party's December elective conference will be chaotic. That's because party members have lost faith on the party's internal processes. According to professor Kwandiwe Kondlo, a political analyst, “The sense one is getting is that the ANC is just going through a serious crisis and it started at the very top and is now filtering down the entire organization. The issue of credentials is important, but people contest and start questioning the credibility of the very people who check credentials. Basically you have a situation where everything is contested. To me, these are symptoms of a party that’s in a process of implosion." eNCA

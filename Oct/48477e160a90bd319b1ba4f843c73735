GLASGOW - Celtic retained top spot in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday with a 1-0 win against Dundee enough to keep them ahead of Aberdeen on goal difference. French midfielder Olivier NtchamÂ found the net with a powerful low shot from 25 yards just after the hour mark but Scott Bain in the home goal should have done better. Ntcham's effort was well-struck and moved in the air, but close enough to the centre of the goal that Bain should have got his body behind it. Victory kept the visitors ahead of second-placed Aberdeen after the Dons also won 1-0 away from home. They made it three straight wins with success at Hibernian, Gary Mackay-Steven providing the finish to a flowing move in the 38th minute to seal the points. Celtic and Aberdeen are six points clear of third-placed Rangers, who beat St Johnstone on Friday. Kilmarnock recorded their first league victory of the season to move off the foot of the table, winning 2-0 at Partick Thistle, who replaced them at the bottom. Kilmarnock appointed former West Bromwich Albion coach Steve Clarke as their new manager earlier on Saturday, but it was interim boss Paul McDonald who masterminded this triumph, with Kris Boyd and Adam Frizzell getting the goals. Motherwell added to Hamilton's problems as they hit back to win 2-1. Hamilton, who on Friday admitted they had fallen victim to a major fraud, went ahead through Giannis Skondras after a quarter of an hour, but Andy Rose equalised just after the half-hour mark and Peter Hartley grabbed the winner shortly after the break. Ten-man Hearts won at Ross County, despite losing Connor Randall to a second booking. By that point there were already 2-1 up, Jamie Walker restoring their lead in the 59th minute after Davis Keillor-Dunn had equalised. And the visitors held on to end Owen Coyle's winning start as County boss. AFP

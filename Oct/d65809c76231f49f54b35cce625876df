POLOKWANE –  Kaizer Chiefs and Polokwane City played to a 0-0 draw in an Absa Premiership fixture played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday night. Despite the goalless stalemate, there was action aplenty. Unfortunately, the finishing from both teams wasn’t up to scratch.

For Chiefs, Siphiwe Tshabalala was wide, George Maluleka fired a shot straight at Polokwane goalkeeper George Chigova and Hendrick Ekstein also forced a good save from Chigova. Out wide Joseph Malangoane was trying to make things happen for Chiefs, but Polokwane’s defence was well-marshalled and superbly organised as they kept the Soweto side at bay. The second half continued in the same vein as chances accrued on both sides. Polokwane had a great opportunity to score soon after the re-start, with Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune parrying an attempt from Jabu Maluleke, and Rendani Ndou then failing to make the most of the rebound.

The chances kept coming, but neither team was able to capitalise. Ramagalela shot wide for Polokwane, while for Chiefs Ekstein hoofed one over the bar and Tshabalala struck the upright. Ndou then had another inviting opportunity to put Polokwane ahead, but he was foiled by a superb stop by Khune. With Chiefs and Polokwane keeping things tight at the end, both teams were happy to run down the clock and settle for the draw.  African News Agency

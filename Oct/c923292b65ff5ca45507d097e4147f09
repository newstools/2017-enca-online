LONDON - The 2023 Rugby World Cup is set to be held in South Africa after the Board of the sport's governing body recommended their bid ahead of France and Ireland, French and Irish media reported on Tuesday. World Rugby's Council is expected to rubber-stamp the recommendation on 15 November. Recommendation will now be put to the vote of the World Rugby Council in London on 15 November. pic.twitter.com/uL8RLEFUnS Japan will host the next tournament in 2019. Ireland had been the bookmakers' favourites having never been the main host before while France were the outsiders having staged the tournament in 2007. South Africa hosted the 1995 World Cup against an extraordinary emotional, social and political backdrop after the country had missed the first two tournaments due to the sporting ban over apartheid. The sight of Nelson Mandela in a Springbok shirt presenting the Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar as South Africa triumphed on home soil is probably the most iconic image in the tournament's history. There had been concerns that the current political instability would work against a return but the evaluation committee clearly felt that it was not an issue. The evaluation was carried out by a team of "internal and external functional area experts", against weighted criteria. They included the likely commercial success and guarantees, venues and political stability. South Africa's 2023 tournament will make use of some stadiums built for the 2010 soccer World Cup. Reuters

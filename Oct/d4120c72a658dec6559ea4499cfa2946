JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma is taking more flak in a new survey. The research was conducted among ANC voters in four provinces earlier this year. It suggests the party's supporters are losing patience with the president.    The key finding in a study conducted by African Response is that ANC supporters want leaders they can trust.  The research company held 16 focus groups with ANC voters. The research also pointed to problems with ANC councillors. Some respondents weren't happy with the performance of their elected representatives. Many ANC voters are growing increasingly frustrated with the governing party, but a lot of them won't support another political party. They're convinced things will change when President Zuma is out of the picture. The ANC will choose a new president in December at its national elective conference.  eNCA

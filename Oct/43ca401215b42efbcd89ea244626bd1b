JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma says media reports suggesting that he supports Mkuseli Apleni’s suspension are false. Zuma has filed an answering affidavit to the North Gauteng High Court whereas he's cited as a respondent. In his response, he says Home Affairs Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize's authority to enforce the suspension is backed by the senior management service handbook. READ: Home Affairs DG says suspension motivated by ulterior motives Apleni is challenging his suspension as home affairs director general. He argues that Mkhize abused her powers when she suspended him for alleged misconduct. Apleni wants the court to set aside his suspension and rule that he be reinstated. The case is set for 17 October 2017. eNCA

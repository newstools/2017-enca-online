JOHANNESBURG - The cute boy caught on video leading Cape Town City soccer players in song is, in fact, seven-year-old Mateo Manousakis, theÂ son of the club's general manager, Basil Manousakis. The club's spokesperson, Julian Bailey, says Mateo is very shy but breaks out of his shell as soon as he interacts with the soccer team. In the video, he is heard mumbling the words of a popular song sung at the stadium during matches. "He is a passionate fan of Cape Town City and he attends all matches, especially during school holidays," Bailey adds. What a cutey! Instagram eNCA

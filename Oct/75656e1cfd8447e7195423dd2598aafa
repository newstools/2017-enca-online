AUSTRALIA - Flanker Jack Dempsey has been ruled out of Australia's northern hemisphere tour with a serious leg injury suffered in the Wallabies' 31-28 victory over the Barbarians on Saturday. Coach Michael Cheika was expected to announce his touring squad on Sunday for Test matches next month against Japan, Wales, England and Scotland. There were reports the NSW Waratahs backrower had badly torn a hamstring, but Cheika was reluctant to go into specifics.

When I say serious, there's no doubt he'll be out of the tour. "And he's in a fair bit of pain too, so let's just see what happens with it. It's unfortunate his season's over." Dempsey has been one of Australia's best-performing players in recent weeks and on Saturday Cheika said the Wallabies could not have won without him. AFP

JOHANNESBURG - The Congress of South African Unions (Cosatu) says the cabinet reshuffle won't serve South Africans if ministers who haven't been performing are still part of it. President Jacob Zuma announced a shake up to the national executive on Tuesday, axing South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande as Higher Education minister and moving a handful of ministers to other departments. The SACP has been a vocal critic of Zuma’s administration, calling for his removal from office for over a year. The ANC, SACP and Cosatu are in a tripartite alliance and the latter says it finds the frequency of cabinet reshuffles unsettling because they do not help to create the much needed stability at government level.

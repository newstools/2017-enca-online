Three years of below average rainfall have exacerbated the situation and despite pro-active measures like implementation of water restrictions and programs to clear the Berg River of alien vegetation, the reality is we are faced with a dire situation.” Bredell said the province is implementing a number of augmentation projects. “Provincial augmentation measures include drilling of boreholes and refurbishment of existing waste water plants and desalination plants on the garden route.  Theewaterskloof is currently at 27 per cent , Voëlvlei Dam is at 27 per cent and Clanwilliam Dam is at 41 per cent while the Brandvlei Dam is 33 per cent. eNCA

LINZ, AUSTRIA - Czech Barbora Strycova beat Magdalena Rybarikova in straight sets in the final at Linz on Sunday to claim her second WTA Tour title. The 31-year-old had not won a title since her maiden success in Quebec City in 2011, but she eased to a 6-4, 6-1 victory in Austria against top seed Rybarikova, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals earlier this year. Strycova was seeded second for the tournament, despite being ranked two places above her Slovakian opponent at world number 26, but she ended a run of five consecutive final defeats with ease. AFP

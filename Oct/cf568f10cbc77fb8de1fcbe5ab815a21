PRETORIA - Protesters at the #BlackMonday protests staged in Pretoria to raise awareness on farm murders, urged South African farmers to take control of their own safety. AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets said Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is now part of the problem of farm attacks and murders which have left many South African farmers fearing for their lives. “We do not get feedback from the minister, so we believe that the minister is part of the problem at this stage. We will continue to put pressure on government but we are not going to align our campaign in such a way that the solution will, at the end of the day, depend on the minister,” he said. “We are going to continue. We are going to look at our own safety better. We are going to continue with international awareness campaigns. "We are going to continue with all of these protest gatherings but we not going to wait for the minister. Fikile Mbalula has made it quite clear that he is not prepared to do something about this.” READ: #BlackMonday protesters block highways in Gauteng, Western Cape Thousands of people took to the streets in different parts of South Africa in the protest dubbed #BlackMonday, raising international awareness of the attacks and killings of farmers in the country. Several major roads were blockaded in Cape Town and in Pretoria. AfriForum has consistently criticised Mbalula for failing to release specific figures and statistics of farm attacks and murders when he tabled the 2016/17 crime statistics in Parliament last week. Last week, Mbalula said farmers should ensure they were compliant with the country’s laws and also desist from hiring undocumented foreigners. “When they turn against you, you blame the police,” he said.

PRETORIA - Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride made his second appearance at the Pretoria magistrate’s court on Monday for allegedly assaulting a teenager. The case was postponed to 24 October to give the State more time to investigate the matter. McBride has been charged with child abuse, alternatively assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. He was granted bail of R10,000 in August. His defence lawyer, Jaco Hamman, attempted to bring an application asking the court to make a final postponement citing that the matter had been regularly delayed. The magistrate turned down the application and said it was premature. He said the delays would be probed at McBride’s next court appearance.

The magistrate emphasised McBride’s bail condition that forbids him from making contact with any of the witnesses or contacting them through a third party. After his brief appearance, Mcbride was whisked away from the media and used a different exit. At his last court appearance in August, McBride did not comment on the allegations, but said he wanted the trial to start so he could clear his name. African News Agency

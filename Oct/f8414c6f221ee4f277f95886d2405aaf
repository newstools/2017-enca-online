LONDON - Everton on Tuesday appointed their Under-23 coach David Unsworth as caretaker manager following the sacking of Ronald Koeman. The 44-year-old will be in the dug out for Wednesday's intimidating trip to champions Chelsea for the League Cup last 16 clash. READ: Everton sack Ronald Koeman Unsworth is a firm favourite with the fans having served the club with distinction as a player making 350 appearances during two spells at Goodison Park. He guided the Under-23 side to the Premier League 2 title last season. Koeman was sacked on Monday after a disastrous start to the season and despite spending big on players, reached its nadir with a 5-2 spanking at home to Arsenal on Sunday leaving them mired in the bottom three.

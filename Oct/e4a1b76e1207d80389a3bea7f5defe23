		Super proud of our Boys and Coaches !!!#TafelLagerGriquas pic.twitter.com/UXuxrqJIt1 Ederies Arendse scored three of the nine tries for Griquas as they booked their spot in the Currie Cup Premier Division once again next season. The Griffons, meanwhile, will stay in first division rugby in 2018. Griquas powered their way to a 26-14 lead at half-time, with Arendse notching up two of his tries in the first period. The floodgates opened up after the interval, with De Wet Kruger and Arendse crossing the whitewash in a short space of time. The Griffons, however, responded with Selvyn Davids also bagging three tries. But some late tries accruing to Wendal Wehr, Tiaan Dorfling and Shaun McDonald sealed the result beyond doubt for Griquas. AFP

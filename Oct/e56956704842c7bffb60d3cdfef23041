JOHANNESBURG - An ANC member in Wesselsbron in the Free State, Ramodise Mokhutle, says he was stabbed at a meeting to discuss the ruling party's December elective conference on Sunday.  According to Mokhutle, speaking from hospital, he wanted to check if he was put down as a delegate for the December conference at a meeting that was "poorly communicated" when he was assaulted and stabbed by a regional leader of Lejweleputswa.  On Sunday, the provincial ANC leadership in the Free State distanced itself from a "so-called provincial consultative conference" in the province.  eNCA

YAOUNDÉ - Cameroonian opposition leader Aboubakar Siddiki has been sentenced to 25 years in prison by a military court on charges that his lawyer and Amnesty International say are politically motivated, Reuters reports. The court convicted Siddiki, the president of northern Cameroon’s main opposition party, of hostility against the homeland as well as revolution and contempt of the president over accusations he plotted to destabilise the country. "We are going to appeal this decision, which does not seem to us to be at all just,” Siddiki’s lawyer, Emmanuel Simh, told Reuters.

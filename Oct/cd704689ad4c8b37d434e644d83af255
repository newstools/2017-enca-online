"We’re delighted to open a new chapter in the Barbarian FC’s history with the creation of our women’s team this season," said Barbarians chairman John Spencer. "Its formation is something we’ve been working towards for a number of years and it is a reflection of the excellence of the global women’s game which was showcased so brilliantly at this year’s Women’s Rugby World Cup in Ireland." He added, "Our aim is to welcome more talented players into this iconic club to forge new friendships and play with the style and passion for which the Barbarians are famous. We are working with clubs and unions around the world to make sure it benefits the players and the game." The Barbarians, formed in 1890, will field players from seven different nations including England, New Zealand, France and Canada in their opening women's game at Thomond Park on November 10. Those who have already accepted invitations have 440 international caps between them. "It’s an incredibly exciting development in international rugby to see the first women’s Barbarians team being formed," said World Rugby's general manager for women's rugby Katie Sadleir. "The talented players that have been recruited from around the world for this team provide an excellent opportunity to deliver more inspirational rugby, maintaining the momentum created during the recent World Cup in Ireland."

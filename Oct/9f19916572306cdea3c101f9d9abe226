CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute warned on Friday of higher than normal tides and stronger than normal rip currents until early next week due to the full moon spring tide, which peaked overnight. “With the school holidays NSRI are particularly urging bathers and anglers to be cautious. The coastline will experience stronger than normal rip currents this weekend,” it said in a statement. NSRI also cautioned bathers to be cautious along the Eastern Cape St Francis Bay coastline where a whale carcass floating off-shore is attracting sharks. African News Agency

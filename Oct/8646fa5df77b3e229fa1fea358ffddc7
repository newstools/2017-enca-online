CAPE TOWN - A train-surfing video showing young men risking their lives was trending on Thursday. Commuters who train surf either hang onto the outside of a train or ride on the roof of the train, often having to duck to avoid electricity lines.

"The logic is 'My friends think I'm cool, I'm king of this, and I’m doing this and that'. And when you look at the adult grouping it’s mostly because Metrorail is not reliable, so, therefore, there will be overcrowding, or [someone's] late and won't be able to catch another train," said Metrorail spokesman Nana Zenani. In September, both Cosatu and Fedusa complained about train safety and called for more security personnel on the railways. Fedusa president Godfrey Selematsela called for a re-introduction of the railway police: “As Fedusa, we call on Prasa (the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa) to reintroduce the railway police to monitor trains and  protect the commuters, including our members who work for the institution.” Metrorail has warned that commuters caught train surfing will be arrested and face criminal charges. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Social media is filled with tweets and posts remembering the legendary singer Lebo Mathosa.  Best remembered as the star girl from the group Boom Shaka, Mathosa was a formidable force in the South African music industry. She was equally successful as a solo artist. Mathosa was also a pioneer in the field of copyrights for South African artists. In a move unheard of in the industry, and especially for a female, Mathosa negotiated and secured full publishing rights and ownership of her work. At the time of her death --  at the age of 29 in a car accident -- on 23 October 2006, Mathosa had plans to start her own label.

JOHANNESBURG - Research conducted by Markdata and African Response has found that ANC supporters remain very loyal. This remains the case, despite corruption concerns by some members and concerns with President Jacob Zuma's leadership. Markdata and African Response's research involved 16 focus groups of ANC supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Gauteng, consisting of participants who voted in the 2014 General Election and last year’s municipal poll.  “Participants believe President Zuma has let them down. They are very unhappy with current leadership but very strongly not changing their support for the (party)… hence (their) continued belief that it will self-correct,” said economist Lumkile Mondi. He explained that this was the first of a two-phase research project. Mondi said that 16 focus groups of four people with a moderator were used to identify how to extract in-depth information from the process. The focus groups were asked what they thought the ANC had done right. The results were used to create a questionnaire, which was submitted to 5,000 respondents.  “What emerged was that ANC did very well in terms of providing what we call (a) social wage... housing, electricity, water," said Mondi. These grants had "done a great deal in alleviating poverty (and) in bringing dignity to black people.”   Mondi said that when participants shared what they believed the party had done wrong, corruption topped the list.  “Corruption was a bigger issue because a lot of them are not getting the resources that they were expecting and they thought the councillors were employing their families. We were not surprised that the information has filtered through to all levels. Corruption, corruption, corruption,” he said. METHODOLOGY: Research on attitudes and beliefs of ANC supporters * Full details of the focus group research will air on The Race on enCA on Monday afternoon at 3.30pm.

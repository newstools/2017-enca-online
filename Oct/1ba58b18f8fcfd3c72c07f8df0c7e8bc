DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal ANC has been given the go-ahead to appeal the High Court judgment that declared its 2015 elective conference invalid. The decision follows a meeting with the party’s top six leaders led by President Jacob Zuma on Sunday. The provincial executive committee remains in place for now, pending the outcome of that appeal. READ: ANC member gunned down in KZN On Tuesday provincial leaders announced that the ANC National Executive Committee had approved the appeal. “The ANC National Executive Committee has taken a decision to support and join the ANC KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Executive Committee’s appeal against the PMB High Court judgment,” the party said. “It is our collective considered view that the judgment contains wider implications and has a potential to distort and weaken the authority of the PEC and NEC which are the supreme structures of organisation with the authority to lead and make decisions in between conferences. “The PEC welcomes and respects the decision of the National Executive Committee to continue and recognise the existence of the ANC KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Executive Committee elected at the 8th provincial conference in November 2015, despite the current legal processes. “We also welcome and commit to the ongoing process of engagements seeking to find a sustainable political solution to the challenges facing the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal.” eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - According to a poll of party members, African National Congress (ANC) members are distressed about the pace of basic service delivery in South Africa. Some voters in urban areas suggest the issue is compounded by the presence of foreign nationals in the country. Markdata and African Response researchers tapped into 16 focus groups in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and the Eastern Cape.

While admitting it performed well in its first two decades in power, there's a sense the ANC has slowed in its delivery of basic services. Members are satisfied the ANC has provided for the people, but argue the party’s current leadership has become somewhat complacent.

That puts the opposition at quite a distinct disadvantage when it comes to mobilizing when you come up against one hundred and five years of significant political history,” says Saraskinsky. In the lead-up to the ANC’s critical elective conference in December, eNCA and eTV will be showcasing further research from Markdata and African Response. eNCA

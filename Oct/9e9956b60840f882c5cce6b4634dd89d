JOHANNESBURG - The state of race relations in South Africa worries many ANC supporters. That's according to the findings of a poll conducted among the party's supporters. Researchers quizzed 16 focus groups, in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and the Eastern Cape. The poll shows that many of them don't think the party is adequately dealing with racism. The prevalence of racial discrimination in the urban areas was a matter of concern for many of the respondents.  Others, did, however, recognise some of the progress made since 1994. Inequality in the workplace also featured prominently among the supporters polled. eNCA senior researcher, Angelo Fick believes the ANC has done a lot to quell racial tensions in the country. "In terms of addressing some of the issues from apartheid South Africa to post-apartheid South Africa, the ANC has a mostly positive track record, but there are some negative moments. In moments of stress we have seen the ANC and many of its officials who are in influential positions participate in actions that don’t actually resolve race issues or racial tensions," said Fick.  Fick said the issue of race shouldn't be left up to the ANC.  "The ANC could have done more and certainly should do more while it is still in power, but that does not absolve all of us who live in this society from our responsibility to change the society and to change ourselves from our behavior in the societies that we live in."  In the lead-up to the governing party's critical elective conference in December, eNCA and eTV will be showcasing more research findings from Markdata and African Response.  eNCA

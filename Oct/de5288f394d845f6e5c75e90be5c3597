JOHANNESBURG – Another politician has been killed in KwaZulu-Natal. Nkosinathi Ngcobo, an ANC member from the Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma municipality was shot dead on Monday night. The latest killing comes almost a month after the death of former ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa. They were both attacked in the Harry Gwala region. WATCH: Sindiso Magaqa laid to rest Following the death of Sindiso Magaqa, the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal established a team to deal with political violence in the province. Ngcobo was killed by three unknown assailants outside his home in Hlanganani, south of Durban last night. ANC KZN spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli: "Once again, one of our own has been gunned down. It's a matter of grave concern to us as the ANC and we really continue to place our hope and faith that the processes that are led by the commission of inquiry, the work of the law enforcement agencies and what we do on the ground will ultimately help us as it did in the early 90s." Despite mainly ANC officials being targeted, the party is reluctant to label these political killings.

We have always been very cautious as the ANC leadership that we do not loosely attribute all these killings as to what others have been terming political because it is only once an investigation has been conducted and you have cold facts before you, that you can say without any fear of contradiction that what you are dealing with here is a killing that is driven by a political agenda," Btuli said. The Moerane Commission of Inquiry into political killings is expected to wrap up this month. Some witnesses have testified corruption and competition for positions are the primary reasons for the murders. Nearly 20 ANC officials have been murdered in KwaZulu-Natal in the past two year eNCA

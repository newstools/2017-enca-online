JOHANNESBURG - The director of the Teddy Bear Clinic, Shahida Omar, said parents of pupils of a Soweto school would also need to go through counselling. This follows the alleged sexual assault of 87 pupils at the school by an employee. READ: 'All of us have to take blame': Education MEC Lesufi Omar said, “The important thing to address is the safety of the children, to ensure their safety and protection. "We have to make sure that we don’t have a recurrent episode of this kind of violation. "We need to continue to provide counselling to the children. But not only to the children. We need to provide counselling to the parents as well in identifying symptoms that they need to look out for and the management of the children’s behaviour.” eNCA

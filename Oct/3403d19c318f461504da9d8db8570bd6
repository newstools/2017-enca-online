JOHANNESBURG - The bail application of a scholar patroller continues in the Protea magistrate’s court.  At least 87 pupils from a Soweto primary school have come forward claiming they were molested by the man. The victims are between grades R and seven. So far only 15 children have provided written statements. READ: Counsellors sent to school where 54 pupils allegedly sexually assaulted The man faces three counts of rape and five counts of sexual assault. More pupils have since been interviewed and the state says it’s likely additional charges will be added. The NPA acknowledges the slow pace of the case, but urges the public to be patient as the children are traumatised. It’s believed the suspect, who is a father of four, has been preying on the children for months. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG -Â Finding your food niche at a mainstream market can be tricky, but Joburg residents were spoilt for choice this weekend. (All pics: Mbali Langa.)  The Sanlam Hand-made Contemporary Fair took place on the Hyde Park Corner roof-top this weekend, and saw thousands attending.   While the fair was mainstream by nature, pretty much every food niche was catered for, be it vegetarian, banting, health-conscious, or alcohol free.    The art and craft on offer also offered something for every taste.     eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance has defended its march to the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home. The party says it’s aimed at showing the true site of President Jacob Zuma’s capture. Zuma on Wednesday unveiled a R6-million monument in the North-West site where he was arrested by apartheid police.

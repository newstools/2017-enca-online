We have a game plan and we will see where it takes us," said Coleman. Martin O'Neill's third-placed Ireland trail Wales by four points ahead of their home encounter against lowly Moldova later on Friday. Spain could effectively clinch their spot in Russia with a win at home to Albania. The 2010 world champions lead Italy, who host Macedonia in Turin, by three points in Group G but own a vastly superior goal difference. Just two points separate the top four countries in Group I, with Croatia and Iceland leading the way on 16 points ahead of Turkey and Ukraine, who are both on 14. Croatia host fifth-placed Finland, while Iceland, who made their major tournament debut at Euro 2016, visit Turkey as Ukraine travel to bottom side Kosovo. AFP

PARIS - Worldwide wine production tumbled 8.2 percent this year to hit a 50-year low due to climate fluctuations, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) said Tuesday. The total output of 246.7 million hectolitres (mhl) was due in large part to steep drops in the top three wine producing countries: Italy, France and Spain. In Italy production slumped 23 percent to 39.3 mhl, while in France the drop was 19 percent to 36.7 mhl. Production in Spain fell 15 percent to 33.5 mhl, according to the Paris-based OIV, an intergovernmental organisation that provides scientific and technical advice on vines and wine.

JOHANNESBURG – A traditional healer accused of performing illegal abortions has been denied bail. Abubakari Kaweesa from Uganda was arrested on Tuesday in Malelane, Mpumalanga and appeared in court on Wednesday. Kaweesa, who goes under the pseudo name of Dr J Rajab was arrested in a joint operation with the Medicines Control Council, the Hawks and the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). “An under-cover agent contacted Mr Kaweesa who confirmed that he does pregnancy terminations for an amount of R700.00. The traditional healer escorted the agent to his premises, where the exchange of money took place to carry out the termination. Subsequently, he was arrested and taken into custody at the Malelane Police Station,” HPCSA said in a statement.

There were no signs of pregnancies being surgically terminated at the time of the inspection,” the council said. HPCSA has warned bogus practitioners and said action will be taken against such a practice. He will appear in court next week Wednesday. eNCA

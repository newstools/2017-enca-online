JOHANNESBURG - Generations: The Legacy actress Letoya Makhene and her boyfriend, Tshepo Leeuw, are expecting a bundle of joy.  The stylish TV personality and her beau have been dating for three years and are evidently besotted with each other, and have not been shy to flaunt it on social media.  Recently, the proud mom of three posted images from her baby shower, where she was nothing short of a vision of a goddess.  Here are a few snaps from her Instagram proudly showing off her baby bump.  The last time I was on the set of @generations_the_legacy ...and me today on set. #MyHappyPregnancy A post shared by Dr Makhene (@letoyamakhene) on eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has expressed concerns about future credit rating downgrades. Gigaba, in charge of reviving the country's ailing economy, sent a chilling warning at the CEO’s breakfast meeting in Durban on Tuesday. He said he is worried about the country’s economy. The warning comes just a week after delivering his maiden Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in Parliament. Gigaba is facing criticism after rating agency, Moodys was unimpressed by his budget speech, saying it signals a departure from earlier efforts to reduce debt.

We know that the economy is in a difficult position,” he said. “We are not going to perform miracles, but we need to work very hard in order to ensure that we uplift the mood of the economy and its performance.” He also slammed Eskom’s request for a 19,9 percent electricity tariff hike, saying it's higher than it should be. “To ask South Africans to pay more tariff when the economy is subdued and the medium-term outlook is as subdued as it is, and we have excess electricity, and we have the types of governance, financial & leadership challenges at Eskom as we are experiencing, I think that would set as a perverse incentives.” WATCH: Reaction to Gigaba's maiden budget speech Business leaders at the gathering pledged to government and the private sector to root out corruption while the minister called on the private sector to stimulate economic growth by working closely with government. eNCA

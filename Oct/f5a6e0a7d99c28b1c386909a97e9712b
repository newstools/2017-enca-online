JOHANNESBURG - A new study shows several ANC supporters don't trust a woman to lead the governing party. Markdata and African Response tapped into 16 focus groups of A-N-C supporters, living in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and the Eastern Cape. Some of them see Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as little more than an extension of President Zuma. They also think female candidates, like Baleka Mbete and Lindiwe Sisulu, are weak. The Race: Lindiwe Sisulu in it with a real chance? According to economist Lumkile Mondi, “They see that women can never be able to resolve a crisis. In order to resolve a crisis you have to get a man. However, in the Nkosozana Dlamini-Zuma case, because of President Zuma, she’s being seen as an extension, so those that are supporting her, they know that at the back of their minds, the person who will be burning the cat is not her. It will be Zuma.” NDZ, as Dlamini-Zuma has become known, is one of the frontrunners, competing against another Presidential hopeful, Cyril Ramaphosa. Mondi says the ANC's patriarchy runs deep, both culturally and institutionally. “So within the ANC, that lip service of gender equality has continued. We saw how it played itself in the SASSA debacle and how the ANC Women’s League has related to these issues. The issue is we have men carrying on to dominate society.” Respondents see Lindiwe Sisulu as competent and steeped in party tradition, but they also think she’s less popular than male candidates. As for the other five candidates, there was little to no mention of them whatsoever. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – More than 100 “lolly pipes” used to smoke crystal methamphetamine (tik) were seized when the City of Johannesburg conducted a crime prevention operation at two properties in Turffontein, mayor Herman Mashaba said on Saturday. “The two properties are notorious for drug and other criminal activities,” he said. The operation was led by the city’s group forensic and investigation services department in conjunction with the South African Police Service (SAPS), Home Affairs Department, Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), Emergency Management Services (EMS), and the city’s environmental health, citizen relationship and urban management, and social development departments.

The SAPS also confiscated 2042 still pain tablets and various other scheduled tablets from one individual. An investigation would be conducted to establish why the individual was in possession of such a high quantity of medication. Twelve cases of alcohol were also confiscated during the operation and a fine was issued for the illegal sale of alcohol. A shop owner was issued with a fine for failing to register as a second-hand goods shop. “The city will not leave any stone unturned when dealing with criminal activities within its area of jurisdiction. We will continue to intensify our crime prevention operations at bad and hijacked properties with the assistance of the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies. “It is essential that we bring back the rule of law in our city and take it back from the criminal elements. We are committed to ensuring that this city becomes a prosperous and inclusive place for our people to live, work, and play. I would like to thank all our role players involved in this successful operation,” Mashaba said.

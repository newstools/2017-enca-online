JOHANNESBURG - Women -- and some men -- have vowed to stay off Twitter on Friday to protest against the suspension of actress Rosie McGowan. Her Twitter account was suspended hours after she claimed that she had been raped by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been outed for sexually assaulting and harassing women for decades.

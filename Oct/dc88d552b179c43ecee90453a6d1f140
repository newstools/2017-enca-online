JOHANNESBURG - Women -- and some men -- have vowed to stay off Twitter on Friday to protest against the suspension of actress Rosie McGowan. Her Twitter account was suspended hours after she claimed that she had been raped by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who has been outed for sexually assaulting and harassing women for decades. READ: Cara Delevingne accuses Weinstein of sexual harassment The suspension of the Charmed actress from the social medium gave rise to the hashtag #WomanBoycottTwitter, with scores of users vowing silence in support of her and other silenced victims of sexual abuse. Ok, so tomorrow.... #boycotttwitter #StandWithWomen @rosemcgowan Tomorrow (Friday the 13th) will be the first day in over 10 years that I won’t tweet. Join me. #WomenBoycottTwitter pic.twitter.com/xoEt5Bwj5s And now THIS? You allow Twitter freedom to our president but you silence a woman speaking out about sexual harassment? @rosemcgowan Sweet dreams, Tweeps. Have a great Friday off Twitter. See you on the flip side! #WomanBoycottTwitter pic.twitter.com/4jn0MoNrfD Men must also stand behind female victims of sexual abuse so I will not be on #Twitter on Friday #RoseMcGowan #WomenBoycottTwitter pic.twitter.com/4NfRut9OQM Signing off tomorrow in solidarity with @rosemcgowan and all survivors out there.

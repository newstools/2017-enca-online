POTCHEFSTROOM - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is critical of the latest cabinet reshuffle. He was addressing the North West Chamber of Commerce on Saturday where he touched on issues, including the economy, skills development and state capture. Ramaphosa seemingly has a different approach to governance from that of President Jacob Zuma and he’s not impressed about the frequent changes of senior government officials. “In the recent past when the cabinet was reshuffled, that in itself introduced instability. Instability in the sense that the minister who were reshuffled had just been in their positions for a few months. Now they are in new positions and have to learn the workings of new departments," says Ramaphosa.  READ: Ramaphosa says he will continue serving SA should Zuma axe him “We’ve seen how director generals, key officials in government, have been removed. There have been shifts on an ongoing basis to the point where the South Africa Institute of Race Relations released a report and said the instability with regard to the tenure (of) Director Generals, Chief Directors and key officials in government has weakened government effectiveness and that is something that is worrying.” The deputy president used the platform to once again speak out against state capture and corruption. He says South Africa runs the risk of becoming a banana republic if corruption is normalised.

Ramaphosa believes active citizenry will be crucial in rooting out corruption. eNCA

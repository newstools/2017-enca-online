It came after the latest episode of his reality television show Papa Penny Ahhee, during which Penny and his wife had a fight about his mother.  IN TWEETS: #PapaPennyAhee is ‘separating VIP from NIP’ The TV star defended his mother and praised her for deciding to have him.  “She is my mother. She never killed me from the planet. If she was wrong she was supposed to kill me from the planet or she was supposed to put me in a condom and put me in the dustbin,” he said. “She is a hero, my mother because I am here because of her.” READ: Penny Penny, drops house album  Fans of the show were left in stitches and reactions came in thick and fast on Twitter.  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) has shaken up its members in the National Assembly on Friday by deploying several Members of Parliament (MPs) to new posts. READ: President Zuma reshuffles cabinet The move comes on the back of Tuesday's Cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma, which saw the South African Communist Party’s Blade Nzimande getting the axe in a move likely to further anger and cause rifts in the tripartite alliance. The SACP has been a vocal critic of the president for some time now.

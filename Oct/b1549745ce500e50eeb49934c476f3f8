JOHANNESBURG - In a far-reaching ruling,  the North Gauteng High Court has limited  the communications minister's powers to appoint and remove SABC board members. Judge Elias Matojane declared several clauses of the Amended Memorandum of Incorporation and the SABC Charter invalid. These pertain to the appointment and discipline of the group CEO, COO, and CFO. The ruling means the board controls the affairs of the public broadcaster and can institute disciplinary proceedings against the three top executives without the approval of the minister. The court found the powers vested in the minister undermined the independence of the public broadcaster. The judgment comes on the same day President Jacob Zuma finally appointed a new SABC board.

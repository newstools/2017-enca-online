SHANGHAI - Australian firebrand Nick Kyrgios stormed off court to boos midway through his opening match at the Shanghai Masters on Tuesday, two days after his China Open final meltdown. The 22-year-old Australian abruptly called it quits immediately after losing the first set 7/5 on a tie break to the American Steve Johnson, having been docked a point penalty for the second match running. On Sunday Kyrgios was similarly docked a point and had a running row with the umpire in losing the final in Beijing to Rafael Nadal. AFP

CAPE TOWN - The South African Football Association are reportedly appealing the red card Bongani Zungu received against Burkina Faso in a World Cup qualifier earlier in October. The two-match ban that comes with a sending off would mean that Zungu would miss Bafana Bafana’s final two World Cup qualifying matches. Both are against Senegal and if South Africa can win both encounters, they should book their spot in Russia 2018.

The former Mamelodi Sundowns man was sent off in the 3-1 win over the Burkina Faso after a scuffle broke out between a large group of players from both teams. Replays seemed to show, however, that Zungu was caught from behind by the elbow of Alain Traore and although he did rush in to retaliate against Traore, Zungu did not make clear contact with his lunging arm.

JOHANNESBURG - Using emojis could land you in trouble in South Africa. Posting a thumbs up, smiley face, or heart might result in a binding legal contract. According to Johannes du Plessis from Risk Benefit Solutions:Â "Including seemingly innocent emoticons and emoji's in your messages these days can actually lead to the conclusion of a contract and you being held liable for a contract. Many people actually use their instant messages and smses an emails to negotiate lease agreements and to purchase agreements with sellers that they found on websites and newspapers and what they need to remember is that the formula for a contract is as simple as an offer plus acceptance." eNCA

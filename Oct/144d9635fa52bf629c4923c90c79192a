JOHANNESBURG – Civil rights group AfriForum's private prosecutions unit said President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane, will be the first case it pursues. Advocate Gerrie Nel will be leading the team bringing a charge of culpable homicide against Zuma. The case relates to an accident on Johannesburg's M1 motorway in 2014. READ: Duduzane was negligent in crash: inquest Zuma crashed his car into a minibus taxi, killing one passenger. A second passenger died a few weeks later, but homicide was ruled out at the time. The NPA declined to prosecute Duduzane Zuma in 2015, saying the evidence would not secure a conviction. Zuma didn't immediately report the accident. eNCA

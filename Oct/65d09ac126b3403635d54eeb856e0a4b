It was a symbolic protest over state capture, and what the DA calls grand corruption by the family, President Jacob Zuma and the ANC. READ: Court rules against Gordhan in Gupta banks case DA leader Mmusi Maimane lead the march, and was joined by outspoken MP Phumzile van Damme. The DA has accused the president and the ANC of being captured by the Gupta family, whose members it says have become billionaires while the majority of South Africans are trapped in poverty. Maimane said that if Parliament did not launch an investigation into state capture by the end of October, his party would take the matter to court. "I wrote to the speaker and said, if you don’t set up the ad hoc committee by the end of October we are taking you to court," he said. "People can’t steal money in South Africa and walk around like nothing has happened. "We can’t protest for free education while the Guptas are stealing billions and sending them to Dubai. It is the ANCs policy of state capture. We reject the ANC policy of willing buyers and willing sell-outs. "What South Africa needs is a new beginning. It needs to cleanse itself from the scourge of corruption that steals resources and opportunities from millions. We are gathered here not to intimidate, we are here to ask for the freedom of our country. Those who are found guilty of corruption must end in jail rather than them having a wedding at Sun City. They must go to jail at the Sun City correctional facility." eNCA

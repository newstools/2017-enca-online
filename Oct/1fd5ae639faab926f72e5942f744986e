CAPE TOWN - Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and Mayco councillor JP Smith have been placed on special leave. The move follows a fallout, which has played out in the media.Â  It started when Smith questioned the closure of the city's special investigating unit, saying this could be linked to alleged irregularities at De Lille's home. De Lille hit back, saying Smith wants to play cowboys and crooks.

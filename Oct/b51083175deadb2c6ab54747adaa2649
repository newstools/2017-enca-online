Kneeling has come to symbolise protest against the politics of Donald Trump since the US president's public dispute with Kaepernick and other prominent figures in American sport. The club posted a picture of the kneeling players on its Twitter account, alongside the words: "Hertha stands for diversity, tolerance and responsibility. For a Berlin which remains open to the world!"

"If we can give them a bit of help in doing so, then that's good." AFP

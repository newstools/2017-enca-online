BERLIN - A satirical look at the European Union and its bureaucracy, which opens with a pig running amok in one of Brussels' main squares, has won the prestigious German Book Prize. Austrian writer Robert Menasse scooped a 25,000 euro (R402,000) prize for his novel Die Hauptstadt ("The Capital") on Monday on the eve of the opening of the Frankfurt Book Fair.

The book, published by Suhrkampf Verlag in September, was one of six books shortlisted for the prize. Menasse, clearly moved, accepted the prize in Frankfurt. Reuters

JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma says he plans to institute an inquiry into state capture. The President, however, said he won't be a part of the inquiry. He's indicated he would do so within 30 days of the North Gauteng High Court ruling on his review, in his favour. WATCH: Zuma abandons state capture application “Having announced an intention to appoint a commission of inquiry, it is recorded that the President will proclaim a commission of inquiry within 30 days of this order,” read a draft order that Zuma's lawyers presented to the court. Zuma also wants Mkhwebane to investigate alleged ethics violations that the Gupta family influenced Cabinet appointments. Last week, Zuma's lawyers dropped his application for the state capture investigation to go back to the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Zuma has fought for parts of former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report to be set aside. eNCA

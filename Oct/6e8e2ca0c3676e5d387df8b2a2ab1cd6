JOHANNESBURG - The Thabo Mbeki Foundation says it's hopeful Friday's Supreme Court of Appeal judgement involving President Jacob Zuma will finally put the matter to bed. In a statement released on Sunday afternoon, the Foundation says the 783 charges against the President, has caused the country unnecessary strain for more than a decade. The NPA and President Zuma failed to successfully appeal a Pretoria High Court order in 2016. The court held that the decision of the NPA in 2009 to discontinue the prosecution of Zuma, was irrational.

	In 2009, former Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions Willie Hofmeyr prepared a 153-page affadavit and dropped the bombshell. The accusation - that Mbeki unduly interfered with law enforcement agencies to ensure Zuma was prosecuted. Mbeki still denies it. Hofmeyr had accused Mbeki of using state resources to fight his political battles. The foundation statement says this still haunts Mbeki today. The Foundation has called on the NPA to act in the interests of justice and the country.  eNCA

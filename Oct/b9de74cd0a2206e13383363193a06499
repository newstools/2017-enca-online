JOHANNESBURG - The opening night of the famous ballet, Snow White, premiered to a full house of ballet enthusiasts at the Joburg Ballet theatre.  Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, in his absentia, sent his committee member, Nonhlanhla Sifumba to welcome guests. Sifumba announced that the mayor's office would be making a formidable contribution of about R8-million towards Joburg Ballet for the next three years.  The artistic director, Ian MacDonald recreated an energetic ensemble of the 19th century German tale of a beautiful girl who drove a queen to malice with her beauty.  The breathtaking portrayal of Snow White was played by Nicole Ferreira-Dill, who had the audience at the edge of their seats as she displayed great "pique" technique.  The Royal Huntsman danced by Leusson Muniz who was poised during "A pas de marché" which was a dignified march as his heart was torn between the queen and Snow White. Following scenes of distress that Snow White endured in the dark forest, the audience sighed in relief when bouncy characters of the Deer, Fox, Owl and the Rabbit.  A comedic performance brought much light-heartedness to the theatre when the pantomime group of the seven dwarfs took to the stage.  The enthralling character of the dark Queen was performed by the renowned ballerina, Kitty Phetla.  Uncommon to ballet etiquette, Phetla infused a contemporary solo which portrayed the jealous queen as the darkest, an outstanding performance.  eNCA

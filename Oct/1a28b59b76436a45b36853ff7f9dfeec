JOHANNESBURG – Salome Pulane Mmola of Thokoza emerged victorious and R720, 000 richer in the Pretoria High Court when rail operator Prasa was found guilty of negligence in its operations. In addition Prasa was also ordered to pay the considerable costs of the court action. Mmole was severely injured on her way to Johannesburg when trains collided at Ravensklip and Knights station on the East Rand in 2011. The court found that Prasa had failed to timeously warn trains on the rail network that there had been a stationary train that blocked the route. It also found that the crash could have been avoided if the driver of the train had applied his brakes in time.

She said there was a growing awareness among the public that they had a right to compensation when they were injured as a result of the negligence of others. eNCA

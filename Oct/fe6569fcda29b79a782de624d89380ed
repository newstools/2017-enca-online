JOHANNESBURG - Despite a slight improvement, sentiment in the manufacturing sector is still weak. Absaâ€™s Purchasing Managers Index improved to 44.9% in September from 44% the previous month. New sales orders and business activity recorded the biggest increases. The score is still below the 50 neutral mark, indicative of a contraction in the industry. But respondents are optimistic about the business outlook for later this year. That index rose above 50, the best level since May. Domestic demand conditions are set to remain tough, despite an improvement in exports following a dip in August. eNCA

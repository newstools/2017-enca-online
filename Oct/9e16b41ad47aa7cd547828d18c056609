JOHANNESBURG – The South African Transport and Allied Workers’ Union (Satawu) has distanced itself from a voice note circulating on social media stating that an industry-wide security strike is planned for Thursday. A voice note threatens that security guards across the country will disrupt operations at airports, railways and shopping malls. It also threatens security officers -- who will be working on the day that they will be met with deadly violence. READ: Satawu plunges into crisis “If you are working, you will die,” the clip says. “By the second of November, I want us all to be in a march fighting for our rights as security guards of South Africa.” The clip goes on to make threats to foreign nationals working as security guards. It says they will be attacked and that they are not welcome in South Africa. Satawu has condemned sentiments in the widely circulated voice note. EXCLUSIVE: Satawu whistleblowers reveal murder, corruption Satawu spokesperson Zanele Sabela said: “South African Transport and Allied Workers’ Union distances itself from a voice note that has been widely circulated on social media stating that an industry-wide security strike is planned for Thursday, 2 November. We condemn in the strongest sense the criminal acts and xenophobic sentiments promoted by the voice note.” It said it does not know the origins of the voice note and does not support its sentiments. The union has since warned its members not to participate in criminal activities. Meanwhile, Satawu said the ongoing Chubb security strike, which began on Monday was not linked to Thursday's alleged strike. eNCA

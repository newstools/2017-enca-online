JOHANNESBURG - The man who was in charge of moving psychiatric patients from Life Esidimeni says his then boss Qedani Mahlangu had no real experience in the health sector. Levy Mosenogi was testifying before the arbitration hearings between the state and families of the victims. At least 118 patients died as a result of being moved from Esidimeni to non-governmental organisations, which were operating unlawfully. WATCH: Health official apologises to Esidimeni victims' families Mosenogi has admitted that the Gauteng health department was not prepared for the relocation process. While he struggled to answer many questions, Mosenogi maintained throughout his testimony that he'd warned the department against the move. He also believes the process would have been thoroughly interrogated had the MEC been an experienced health official.

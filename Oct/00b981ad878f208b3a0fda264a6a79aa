JOHANNESBURG - Let it not be said that eNCA reporters don't go above and beyond to bring you the day's news. In a light moment, reporter Xoli Mngambi was at the receiving end of a cheeky slap, when he approached ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe in Boksburg on Friday morning. Our Newsday anchor Jeremy Maggs asked him about the incident earlier Friday. "Am I correct in saying he tried to touch you on your studio?" "Well Jeremy that's a moment and a half because, a slap allowed me the space to breathe but he did give us a long interview with other media but I was all done in jest, no harm intended," laughed Mngambi. eNCA

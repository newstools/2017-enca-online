JOHANNESBURG - It seems not everybody has accepted the outcome of Saturday’s Democratic Alliance (DA) Western Cape elective congress. Top contender for the leadership position, Lennit Max is challenging the result. He lost the race to Bonginkosi Madikizela, who's been acting in the position since January. This is the fourth time Max has campaigned for the position. The party says it’ll look into his complaint, but maintains everything at the congress was above board. According to James Selfe, DA federal chairperson, "Mr Max has every right to lodge a complaint, but from conversation with the presiding officer, it seems as if everything took place above-board and his own inside agent signed off on the results. So it's a little bit difficult for him now to come and lodge a complaint, but obviously we will have an open mind on this matter and interrogate the questions that he asks with the attention that they deserve". eNCA

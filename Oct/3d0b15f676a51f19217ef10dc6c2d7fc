JOHANNESBURG - Wim de Klerk is stepping down as the CEO of Arcelor Mittal South Africa in January 2018. He’s been at the helm of the country’s largest steelmaker for less than two years.
	
	The company approved de Klerk’s request to retire. In recent times, Arcelor Mittal SA has cut costs to stem losses. It’s also been calling for emergency steel tariffs to protect the local industry against cheaper imports. eNCA

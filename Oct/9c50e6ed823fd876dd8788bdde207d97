PARLIAMENT - The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) reacted to the release of the national crime statistics  in Parliament on Tuesday with a call for less political interference in the process of policing. Gareth Newham, head of the Justice and Violence Prevention Unit, focused his comments on the murder statistics because they are the most reliable to track. LIVE STREAM: 'Our station level must ensure we're felt in communities': Mbalula In 2016/17, the police recorded a total of 19,016 murders, up from 18,673 murders in 2015/16. The murder rate increased marginally from 34.1 to 34.2 per 100,000 people. The Eastern Cape had the highest murder rate at 55.9 per 100,000 people. In 2016/17, an average of 52.1 people were murdered every day. Newham characterised the increase in the murder rate as a failure by the government to control the violent nature of crime. He said policing could not be the only intervention tried to reduce violent crime. Grassroots interventions must be used so children did not grow up in violent environments. The ISS also commented on the aggravated robbery case statistics, which showed an increase of 6,4 percent from 2015/2016. Newham urged police to identify gangs and syndicates that buy and sell stolen goods. He brought attention to the increase in funds allocated to the police service. Inappropriate political interference in the police service was the largest problem facing the SAPS, he said. "The National Development Plan has identified the serial crisis of top management as a fundamental problem in policing in South Africa." Once someone was appointed they restructured the top echelons and people in the rest of the police department were unable to execute their duties properly. Newham also pointed to patronage and protection of corrupt officials. To combat this, the ISS proposed that Parliament appoints national police commissioners according to a transparent, merit-based and competitive process. eNCA

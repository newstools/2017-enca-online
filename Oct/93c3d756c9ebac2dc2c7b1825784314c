JOHANNESBURG – The South African Communist Party (SACP) has reacted to President Jacob Zuma’s decision to fire Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande. “This is a clear declaration of war on the SACP by President Zuma,” the SACP's Solly Mapaila said. “He has retained dead wood in that Cabinet,” he added. Mapaila accused Zuma of being detached from the ANC. eNCA

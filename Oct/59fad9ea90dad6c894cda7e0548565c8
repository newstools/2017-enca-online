NEW YORK - South African opera singer Golda Schultz has made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York, just six years after graduating from music school. Her meteoric rise all came about after a chance encounter with opera while she was studying in South Africa. Schultz has risen quickly in the operatic world, hitting all the right notes, to reach new heights of success. Sheâ€™s still coming to terms with her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, now singing on the very stage that as a student she dreamed of performing on. Her run at the Met ends next week. But the opera world is likely to be singing her praises well beyond that. * Watch the full video report by Nick Harper in the gallery above. eNCA

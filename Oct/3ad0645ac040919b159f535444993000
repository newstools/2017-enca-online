JOHANNESBURG – Reeva Steenkamp’s mother, June, says she was shocked to find out about the US movie about her daughter's killer, Oscar Pistorius. She's concerned about how Reeva comes across in the film. “She was such a wonderful person fighting against abuse, and I want to make sure that however she’s portrayed is in the right light. This is like a real smack in the face for us as a family. We can’t believe that someone can go out and make these things without any knowledge of or contact with us,” she said. WATCH: Trailer for Oscar Pistorius movie Steenkamp’s mother also questioned Pistorius’s sentence for killing her daughter and said it's too lenient. “It’s out of respect for her, she’s not breathing anymore. He’s still breathing and what I’m saying is he has to get punishment for what he has done. I’ve forgiven him, but he must still pay for the crime that he has committed. He shot through a door. If it was a burglar he would also have been a murderer. I just want to hear if it was enough of a sentence for him.” WATCH: Reeva was about to leave Oscar: June Steenkamp The film is set to premier in the United States on 11 November, but no date has yet been given for the local release.

JOHANNESBURG - South Africa beat Bangladesh by 333 runs on the fifth day of the first Test at Senwes Park on Monday. Thunderstorms on Sunday had thwarted South Africa's chances of wrapping up victory in four days in a match overshadowed by an injury to fast bowler Morne Morkel, who is likely to be out for six weeks because of a side strain. Morkel had taken two wickets in his first over at the start of Bangladesh's second innings on the fourth day of the first test at Senwes Park on Sunday but subsequently hurt himself bowling and had to be taken off. He joins a long list of South African test pacemen ruled out of the series through injury. Chris Morris, Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn are all expected to return for the three-test series against India and four matches against Australia at home from January to March next year. - Aditional reporting Reuters - AFP

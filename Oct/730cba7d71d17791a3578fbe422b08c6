GOT HIM! M Rahman is caught & bowled by @keshavmaharaj16 for 1. BAN all out for 90. SA take a 1-0 lead in the series. #ProteaFire #SAvBAN pic.twitter.com/YzIdnBdc4j Morkel had taken two wickets in his first over at the start of Bangladesh's second innings on the fourth day of the first test at Senwes Park on Sunday but subsequently hurt himself bowling and had to be taken off. He joins a long list of South African test pacemen ruled out of the series through injury. Chris Morris, Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn are all expected to return for the three-test series against India and four matches against Australia at home from January to March next year.

JOHANNESBURG – Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini revealed on Monday that a deal for the Post Office to issue South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grants is off. She made the comments while addressing the media in East London in the Eastern Cape. This comes amid fresh warnings, with experts sounding the alarm over Sassa's lack of preparation as they try to prevent another potential crisis like the one the country saw last year. The agency has just under five months to bring all potential service providers on board before phasing out CPS, as ordered by an earlier Constitutional Court ruling. But Sassa on Monday revealed the South African Post Office won't be able to provide all services. Dlamini says Postbank does not have a fully-fledged banking licence, which means this could impact recipients due to limited banking services. eNCA

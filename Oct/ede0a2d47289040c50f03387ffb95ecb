JOHANNESBURG – South African diversified miner Exxaro Resources said on Wednesday that it has completed the sale of at least 20 percent stake in Tronox Limited for approximately $474 million, or about R6,5 billion. Tronox Limited is a NYSE-listed company engaged in the mining, production, and marketing of inorganic minerals and chemicals. The South African coal and heavy minerals mining company has beneficial ownership of 44 percent at an approximate value of $911 million in Tronox, the American multinational chemical company involved in the titanium products industry.

The disposal reduces Exxaro’s ownership of Tronox’s total outstanding voting shares from approximately 51,2 million to approximately 28,7 million, representing approximately 24 percent of Tronox’s total outstanding voting shares. This transaction follows Exxaro’s previous announcements of its intention to monetise its stake in Tronox in a staged process over time. Exxaro said the net proceeds from the disposal will be used to provide funding for its future capital commitments to 2020, to repay debt and to return capital to its shareholders. The miner said its management will continue to assess market conditions going forward for further possible sell downs in its remaining Tronox investment and shareholders will be advised accordingly.

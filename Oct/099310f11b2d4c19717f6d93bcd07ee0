CAPE TOWN - Scammers are getting smarter and constantly changing the technologies they use to skim bank cards or hack into bank accounts. The massive data breech of 30 million South Africans that came to light this week only adds to their arsenal. WATCH: After SA data breach, Tlakula says we should all take more care That's why the police, the Hawks, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and banks are coming together to educate consumers. With the festive season just around the corner, it's time for shoppers to be extra vigilant. Jerome Hardenberg of the Hawks serious commercial crime unit says, "The handheld skimming device, they have used for a very long time. Then we have ATM attachments. Now it has changed, using the same principle but it's become a little bit more advanced. They've taken that skimming technology and put it into point of sale devices." An estimated R350 million was lost in 2016 due to this kind of criminal activity, which is why this awareness programme is key. "People are human, people forget to do certain things to be proactive when they go to an ATM. There's also a lot of things the general public need to be taught continuously, like what does an ATM attachment look like, what are the latest trends when it comes to skimming your card in a restaurant," says Hardenberg.  Confidentiality is key. READ: What to do when your data has been leaked According to Kevin Twiname of the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric), "Ensure that you cover the hand that is inserting the pin. Always do that, because without the pin criminals cannot transact. "Things like passwords or pin numbers on your app or online banking, that is key...It should not be shared with anyone else." This programme will run in the Western Cape over the next three months.  eNCA

CAPE TOWN - Newly appointed State Security Minister Bongani Bongo says he wants to move with speed to implement the targets set for him. Bongo was sworn-in in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon at the presidential residence. "I've just been sworn-in now, the DG's here, I'm looking forward to meet with the team. So that we move with the serious speed in terms of ensuring that we meet the targets that the government has set us to deal with in the medium term. Thank you very much," he said.

Before Tuesday's cabinet reshuffle, the relatively unknown Bongani Bongo was an ANC parliamentary backbencher. With no previous experience in the executive, he's now the new man in charge of the State Security Agency. A lawyer by profession, Bongo's exposure to security matters reportedly began at the premier’s office in Mpumalanga. Bongo was deployed to parliament in 2014, and was among the ANC MPs who publicly supported the president during the failed motion-of-no-confidence in August. He replaces David Mahlobo, who's the new minister of energy. Mahlobo's ascension to this portfolio has raised speculations that the nuclear programme will now become a reality. Adding to the concerns are reports of his recent travels to Russia with controversial businessmen Kenny Kunene and Gayton McKenzie, where the pair allegedly sold themselves as possible BEE partners in an energy deal. eNCA

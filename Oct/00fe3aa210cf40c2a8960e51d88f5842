JOHANNESBURG - Blue Bulls coach John Mitchell has named an unchanged starting team to face Steval Pumas at Loftus Versfeld on Friday in the home side’s last Currie Cup league fixture of the season. Mitchell only made one forced change amongst the reserves from the squad that travelled to Bloemfontein last weekend, with Ulrich Beyers being replaced by Travis Ismaiel. Beyers were concussed in the win over the Toyota Free State Cheetahs and unavailable for this weekend, while Ismaiel makes a timely return from injury.

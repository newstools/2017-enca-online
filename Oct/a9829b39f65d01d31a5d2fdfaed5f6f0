JOHANNESBURG - Afriforum's private prosecution unit is going after President Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane. Advocate Gerrie Nel is leading the team hoping to secure a culpable homicide conviction. The case relates to a car crash in 2014 when Zuma crashed his car into a taxi, killing a passenger, Phumzile Dube. According to Nel, AfriForum's head of prosecutions, "We think there should be a prosecution and therefore we assisted the Dube family to apply for a certificate and it's now over to the NPA to decide if they would issue such a certificate and when and they also have the option to reconsider their decision and prosecute themselves. If the NPA did not issue the nolle prosequi certificate, AfriForum would have to start the private prosecution process within 90 days. "The family will get a certificate and  get somebody to prosecute on their behalf. Because to get a certificate, you have to show a particular interest in a matter, but her family will qualify in my view, and they will get a certificate and request us to prosecute on their behalf." The Dube family is eager to see to it that, with @afriforum ’s help, justice will prevail in Dube’s death. #GerrieNel #WeProsecute ... eNCA

The target – the president. “The actions of some leaders of the ANC collaborate with calls for us to contest test power due to the corrupt actions. Zuma will be judged harshly by history because he is contributing to the collapse of the Alliance in the country,” says Bonakele Majuba, SACP Mpumalanga Secretary. Bonakele Majuba believes ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is the only one who can unite the crumbling tripartite alliance. “We know that in Mpumalanga when we as the SACP and the ANC were fighting, it's Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa who came here to unite us. It's Ramaphosa who can unite the alliance, other people we don’t know.” SACP leaders believe the country is sold to corrupt individuals. “Our country is going down, its being stolen right in front of our eyes. If we don’t act nothing will change. We need to change how our government works,” says Solly Mapaila, SACP Mapaila says the country is on the verge of bankruptcy due to reckless leaders.  eNCA

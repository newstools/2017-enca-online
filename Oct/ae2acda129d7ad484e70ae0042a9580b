JOHANNESBURG – Cricket SA (CSA) on Sunday congratulated the Proteas on winning the T20 International series, beating Bangladesh by 83 runs in the second game of the two-match series at Senwes Park on Sunday, to clinch the series 2-0. They won the first match by 20 runs at the Mangaung Oval on Thursday evening. “This is another important step forward for our new leadership team headed by national head coach Ottis Gibson, Faf du Plessis as well as stand-in captain JP Duminy and congratulations are due to them and all the players and management staff,” said CSA acting Chief Executive, Thabang Moroe. “It has been heartening to see the way responsibility has been given to some of the younger players to show that they can step up and broaden our talent pool. “The time has come for us to move up the T20 rankings to the same level achieved by our Test and ODI squads and this forms part of this process. “I would also like to thank and congratulate the Free State and North West unions that have hosted these matches. They have been extremely well supported,” said Moroe. African News Agency

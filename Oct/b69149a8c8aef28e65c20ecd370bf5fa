JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town only has enough water until March next year. The city says it's cracking down hard on those who don’t toe the line, on the unprecedented level five water restrictions. And to make sure enough water is conserved, mainly during Summer, the city is relying heavily on water monitoring devices. "We are in for a long, hot, dry summer period where we will see a rapid decline of our dam levels. If consumption is not reduced to the required levels of 500 million litres of collective usage per day, we are looking at about March 2018 when supply of municipal water would not be available. The day or month of this happening is, however, not as important as what we do now to avoid such a time," said Cape Town Mayor, Patricia De Lille.  READ: Cape Town takes drastic measures to save water Dams are at 27.6 percent usable water. The city has made public its Critical Water Shortages Disaster Plan, which includes three phases. Phase one, water rationing, is already in place - where water pressure across the city has been decreased. As the situation intensifies, phases two and three will be activated. These include supplying water to residents via water distribution points. "Residents will then be able to collect a predefined quantity of drinking water per person per day from these collection sites. So that is when we go into phase two," she said. The city has also prepared an application to access the Global Green Fund, set up at COP21. Final approval lies with national government. Desalination plans are also expected to get under way in December this year. eNCA

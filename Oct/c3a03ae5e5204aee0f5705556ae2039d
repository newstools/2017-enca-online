JOHANNESBURG - Trading in the shares of Nigerian oil company Oando was halted on both the Lagos and Johannesburg stock exchanges on Thursday following an order by Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Oando said it would “provide a full statement of the company’s position as soon as possible”. On 14 July 14‚ Oando released a statement saying: “Our attention has been drawn to a report released by Channels TV stating that Oando is ‘under a comprehensive investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission following petitions filed by some foreign investors in Oando regarding its shareholding structure following the $1.65-billion in cash that Oando paid in June 2014 to acquire the oil production assets of Conoco-Phillips in Nigeria’.” READ: Angola is not the next Venezuela, state oil firm says as it cuts debt Oando said then that it understood that the SEC had correspondence containing "unsubstantiated‚ misleading and defamatory claims" about  with respect to various matters that had already received board‚ shareholder and‚ where required‚ SEC approval”. On 18 August, Oando named the investors who had petitioned the SEC as an institution called Ansbury and an individual called Alhaji Mangal. Oando disputed Ansbuy's right to petition because it was not a direct investor in the oil group‚ owning shares via “a company domiciled in a jurisdiction outside Nigeria which in turn holds shares in a Nigerian investment company that is a shareholder in Oando”. Mangal said in his petition to the SEC that he owned 17.9 percent Oando‚ which the oil company disputed‚ saying its records showed he owned 4 percent directly‚ and had failed to disclose a 13.9 percentt  indirect holding as required by Nigerian law.

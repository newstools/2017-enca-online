JOHANNESBURG - Big names including singer Tamara Dey and gay rights advocate Frank van Dalen attended this year's Johannesburg Pride march on Saturday along with hundreds of supporters of LGBTI rights. They converged on Melrose Arch, supported by brands including Starbucks and Google. "Even though we live in a free country we need to make sure that the rights of the LGBTI community are still seen in places like Egypt and Chechnya. These places are seeing LGBTI people persecuted, so we are happy and lucky we live in South Africa, but we need to show we are still striving for that peace and freedom," said one reveller.

JOHANNESBURG - The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa is taking preventative measures against the recent outbreak of avian influenza (birdflu) in areas neighbouring Pretoria. There have been no cases of the virus found at the zoo to date.  Spokesperson for the zoo, Craig Allenby says there is cause for concern and therefore the zoo has increased its biosecurity measures. “We have moved endangered bird species, like the cranes, that were in open enclosures into covered aviaries to prevent their interaction with wild bird species. The risk of transfer of the virus is increased through contact with wild birds," says Allenby.  The zoo is also in the process of introducing additional coverings to prevent contact with wild birds where aviaries are not available. All vehicles entering the zoo are also treated with an anti-viral disinfectant to prevent the virus from entering the zoo. Foot baths have also been introduced at the main entrance for the visitors to use on their arrival. The disinfectant is not harmful to humans. According to Allenby, additional husbandry practices have also been implemented to prevent any cross-contamination or spread should the virus enter the zoo. Husbandry refers to the care, cultivation, and breeding of crops and animals.  eNCA

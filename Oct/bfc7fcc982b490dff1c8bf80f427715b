JOHANNESBURG – South African Revenue Service (Sars) customs officials seized 30kg of cocaine worth an estimated R9-million in two separate incidents at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Friday, SARS said. In the first incident, collaboration between Sars customs and the South African Police Service (SAPS) led to the arrest of a passenger disembarking from a Sao Paulo, Brazil flight via Johannesburg in transit to Mozambique, Sars spokesman Sandile Memela said. READ: Police seize 143kg of cocaine at OR Tambo A scan of the passenger’s luggage revealed irregular images and led to a second inspection which uncovered 10 boxes of imitation jewellery. Ninety “wooden sticks” were found in the boxes concealing a white substance which tested positive for cocaine. A total of 24.66kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of R7,094,682 was confiscated and handed to the SAPS, he said. In the second incident, Sars customs officials intercepted 6.3kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of R1,812,510 concealed in the base of a passenger’s luggage.  The passenger was also on a Sao Paulo flight travelling via Johannesburg in transit to Mozambique. Both the passenger and the consignment were handed over to the SAPS for investigation. “The successful operations are part of the increased joint operations between Sars and the South African Police Service,” Memela said.

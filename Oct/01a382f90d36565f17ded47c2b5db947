JOHANNESBURG - McKinsey, in a press statement on Tuesday, said that they would repay all fees received from Eskom if a court found that Eskom had acted unlawfully. The consultancy said Eskom had been a client since 2005 and they "stand by our work at the company." READ: Save SA expected to protest outside McKinsey's offices McKinsey noted that Eskom had "advised us that it believes it violated procurement regulations and its internal procedures in the formation of the contract, and that decisions it took with respect to the contract may have been taken without proper authorisation." Mckinsey noted that it did not want to benefit from an illegal contract, even it had "entered into the contract and performed its work in good faith." It had therefore decided that, "to provide reassurance to the citizens of South Africa, we will support a review by the High Court of the validity of the turnaround program contract. We invite Eskom and Trillian to submit themselves to this process too.  "We plan to set aside the full fee McKinsey earned on the turnaround programme in a ring-fenced account ready to comply with the court's decision." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - It was an emotional day for families at the Life Esidimeni hearings in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Senior Gauteng Health Department official, Levy Mosenogi apologised to victims' relatives.  More than a hundred psychiatric patients died last year after they were moved from Life Esidimeni centres to NGO's. READ: Life Esidimeni death toll rises again Patients were moved quietly and swiftly to NGOs, but not long after the transfers, there were complaints of patients being housed in ill-equipped and dodgy facilities. On Wednesday,  the man in charge of moving the patients dropped a bombshell. Levy Mosenogi claims that he didn't know how patients were being transported. According to Mosenogi, there was no written plan in terms of the transportation of those patients from Life Esidimeni to those various NGOs. When asked about reports of patients being transported in open vans, he said he was not aware of that mode of transport being used. You can watch a recording of Wednesday's proceedings below.  eNCA

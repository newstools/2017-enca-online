KRUGERSDORP - A video has emerged, showing how cash-in-transit guards try to prevent a group of robbers from making off with a bag of money at a Krugersdorp petrol station.  The footage shows one of the suspects, struggling to drag the bag to the getaway car.  The guards are then seen literally giving the robbers a run for their money, speeding towards their vehicle and sending them scurrying.  The spokesperson for G4S Cash Solutions said, “During the incident, a G4S employee was shot in the leg. He is now in a stable condition after being treated in hospital and both crew members involved are being supported with trauma counseling. “This serious attack is the subject of a police investigation and we encourage anyone with any information about those behind it to contact the South African Police Service.” Despite efforts to prevent the robbers from getting away with their loot, they fled with an undisclosed amount of money. An investigation into the matter is still underway. eNCA

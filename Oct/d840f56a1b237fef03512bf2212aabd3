	Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the event. Other high profile speakers include Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini and the SACP’s Solly Mapaila. Mapaila was cautioned by the ANCYL over his public statements earlier this week. He'd criticised President Jacob Zuma’s cabinet reshuffle, saying it was a distraction and a declaration of war on the ANC’s alliance partner. SACP leader Blade Nzimande was sacked in the latest cabinet change. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene says President Jacobs Zuma's administration would have to amend the Public Finance Management Act and other laws governing the role of treasury, in order for the Presidency to assume some budgeting functions. In September it was revealed the Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation department, headed by minister Jeff Radebe, had produced a mandate paper.

Meanwhile, Nene said events at KPMG have exposed weaknesses in the auditing profession. He said he doesn't know why SARS insists on holding onto a report that KPMG has withdrawn. Two weeks ago, SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane told journalists that the report in question supports findings of two other investigations at the revenue service. “I found it strange that when the authors of a report we continue to want to hold on to that report and in my view it’s a matter that should be settled at a legal level but fact of the matter is that report no longer exists if it has been withdrawn by its authors,” Nene said. eNCA

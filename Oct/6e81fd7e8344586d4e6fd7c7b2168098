JOHANNESBURG – Lanes on the M1 road were officially opened on Tuesday. We would like to thank all the people who have worked around the clock to make the #M1Freeway a world class road infrastructure #M1Opens pic.twitter.com/EqPgx8OegR The M1 Oxford and Federation bridges structural rehabilitation project was launched in November 2015 and combined with the other M1 Double Decker Rehabilitation project is estimated at R210 million, the largest construction project, to date, carried out by the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA). The City of Johannesburg said the project was initially scheduled for completion in September 2016, however, geotechnical complications resulted in an extension of the scope of the works, which accounts for the remainder of the extended construction period. Working together as an integrated city region, we put the needs of the citizens first #M1Opens pic.twitter.com/WC235B9eza Gauteng Premier David Makhura, Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi and Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba were among the dignitaries at the launch on Tuesday. “As we launch the completion of the M1 project and kick-start Transport Month, I would like to thank all road users for their patience during the 24-month three-phase rehabilitation of the M1, Oxford and Federation bridges project,” SAID Mashaba. “Many had adjusted their travel times to accommodate the traffic deviations and road closures. It has been a long journey to reach completion however, the major construction and structural rehabilitation was a critical undertaking to ensure the safety of all road users.” The M1 freeway will be reopened to three lane traffic in two directions, in a phased approach: • M1 northbound 3 lanes will reopen on Monday 9 October. • M1 southbound 3 lanes will reopen on Monday 16 October. • M1 Oxford road off ramp will remain closed at this stage.

This has not changed and 2015 was the last time we were able to perform or work with him," the group said on its website.Spandau Ballet, best known for their music in the 1980s, including hits 'True', 'Gold' and 'Through the Barricades', has a history of tension between members.Most of their best-known songs were written by guitarist Gary Kemp, who received a larger cut of royalties than the other four members of the band. Hadley, Keeble and Norman lost a court battle in 1999 to claim some of those royalties.By 2009, the band had reunited to perform a sold-out tour across Britain and Ireland.Reuters

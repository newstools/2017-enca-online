BISHO - Traditional leaders, kings and queens gathered at the Bisho Stadium in the Eastern Cape to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa joined the celebrations and also met privately with the leaders to discuss their concerns. Ramaphosa's bid to become president also got some light-hearted attention when he was reffered to as the President in the absence of President Jacob Zuma. Last week's Eastern Cape delegation to the ANC Policy Conference was also clear about who it supports in the race to become ANC president in December, singing songs praising the deputy president.

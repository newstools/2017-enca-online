JOHANNESBURG - Fees Commission Spokesperson Musa Ndwandwe says the presidentially-mandated investigation into the nation-wide #FeesMustFall protests has been completed. He says the commission will take two months to finalise its report and make recommendations to the president on how to deal with funding for Higher Education. According to Ndwandwe, the final report will offer various scenarios, with their cost implications set out to the president. However, the "dominant view" in representations made to the commission was that "Higher Education is a public as well as private good, so there has to be a balance" with people paying for university education "at a time that they are able to". The interim report from the commission, released last year, suggested that free tertiary education for all was not feasible. Ndwandwe says the final report will be "vastly improved" and attempt to find "lasting solutions" to the issue of tertiary education funding in South Africa "once and for all" so that protests at universities do not continue being a "yearly event". eNCA

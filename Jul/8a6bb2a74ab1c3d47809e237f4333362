The abandoned vehicle was later recovered in Alexandra. Police said they would continue discussions with the management of the warehouse security about the easy access to security clothing and equipment. "The easy accessibility, or the lack of protection thereof is exacerbating the efforts by police to prevent these robberies from taking place," said police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo."Inside involvement in this robbery cannot be ruled out at this stage."The case was being investigated by the recently established multi-disciplinary team comprising specialised investigators, Crime Intelligence and forensic experts."Both the dead suspect, as well as the arrested suspect and the recovered firearms will be profiled to determine if they were involved in other similar crimes," said Naidoo.This robbery came after a brazen heist at OR Tambo Airport in March. eNCA

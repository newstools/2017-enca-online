JOHANNESBURG – The songs sung by various groups of ANC delegates were yet another indication of the divisions within the party. On Friday, party members used music to show how they felt about the issues that would be discussed at the party’s National Policy Conference (NPC), taking place in Nasrec. Song and dance were an integral part of ANC events, even as the organisation morphed from a liberation movement to a governing party. Some delegates sang songs in praise of the party and its leader President Jacob Zuma, while others expressed a desire for a change in leadership. One group of attendees sang ANC kuzolawul’ wena, which means “ANC you will rule.” The ANC had been besieged by disunity and factional battles, reflected by the ANC's North West delegation which sang Silamulel’ Tambo meaning “Intervene Tambo.” Delegates from the Eastern Cape performed Usheshe washo, Zinsiwa zilelekule dawo. But many sang songs with a very different tone, expressing a wish to see a different approach in leadership ahead of the party's December elective conference. The song Shona Malanga sizodibana ngebhazuka ehlathini translated into "We will meet in the bush with a bazooka." Another group sang Ubani ozofakaza ngawe translated into “Who will testify about you.” Some ANC members indicated their frustration at having political freedom but not being in control of the economy. Just before proceedings got underway, a group belted out Asiphelelanga, kushoda umnotho, translated into “We aren't satisfied, we need economic liberation.” eNCA

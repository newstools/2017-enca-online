JOHANNESBURG - The DA welcomed Tuesday's Labour Court ruling to postpone Brian Molefe s case, pending the outcome a High Court application against him, the party said in a statement.Molefe has also been ordered to pay the party's legal costs."This is directly in line with what the DA argued for in court and is a victory," the party said.READ: Molefe claims he never resigned from EskomThe DA said it has consistently held that Molefe resigned from his position as Eskom s Group CEO after which he took up a post as a Member of Parliament.The party said Molefe's actions and statements by Eskom and the minister at the time indicated that Molefe had resigned."Further, section 47 of the Constitution is clear that a person may not become a Member of Parliament while still in the employ of, or receiving remuneration from, a state entity," the statement said.The DA said Molefe approached the Labour Court to argue the illegality of his removal from Eskom by its board in early June, but its contention has always been that this cannot be argued until the substantive matter of his resignation and then subsequent re-employment have been dealt with by the High Court."It is our contention that Molefe s re-employment at Eskom was completely irrational and illegal and as a result has no lawful position at Eskom," the statement said."We look forward to presenting our arguments in the High Court so that we can ensure that Molefe is held accountable on this issue."It is clear that Molefe is not fit to restore good governance practices at the Eskom and indeed should have no further place there," the DA saideNCA

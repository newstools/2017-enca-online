Chetty admits that England will most likely be the toughest match they will have played so far, but she believes the team is up for the challenge and are mentally and physically ready to go.READ: South Africa see off Pakistan in Women's World Cup When you come into a competition like this, you have to be prepared no matter what and we ve done that mental and physical prep and are ready. I think what we ve done well in this World Cup so far is to concentrate on ourselves and what we do well rather than the who (we are facing) and worrying ourselves out of a game. Yes, England are a good side, they have been for a long time, but we ve played them numerous times now and we know what to expect. Tomorrow, I think the key will just be to carry on playing our best kind of cricket, execute our skills well and stick to the basics. We re up for this challenge, the girls are in a good space, everyone s happy and I think tomorrow will be a good game to watch. African News Agency

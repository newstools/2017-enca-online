JOHANNESBURG - While the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has downplayed a burglary at its offices in Pretoria, Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu believes the country is in a dangerous space.Sisulu, who is also an ANC NEC member, was referring to the recent break-ins at the offices of law enforcement agencies, when she said: "When we have a weakened security that indicates most other areas are in trouble.""Security is the last bastion of hope for anybody," says Sisulu. "When we have repeated break-ins like we've had in the Hawks, yes I am worried. I'm worried who is hacking into the systems, who is driving an agenda that is determining what we say what we discuss in our conferences.There clearly is a retrogressive agenda, we are not moving forward, we are almost stuck in one place or even going back in certain areas. It's very worrying, but it ought not happen in any society."Burglars broke into the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) on Sunday night.Last week, burglars broke into the Hawk's headquarters in Pretoria. The alleged mastermind in the break-in at the offices of the Chief Justice earlier this year was due back in court on Monday.The NPA has, however, downplayed the latest judicial break-in incident, saying only two laptops were stolen and that these laptops did not contain information that could compromise any NPA cases. eNCA

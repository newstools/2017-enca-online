JOHANNESBURG - Opel is working to revive its sporting legacy, which has been in limbo over the past few years, by announcing the new Opel Insignia GSi. Those with long memories will recall the GSi badge on luminaries like the Monza and Kadett, and even lately the Astra and Corsa.While the Volkswagen GTI badge has grown in stature in leaps and bounds over the years, Opel s GSi lay in tatters, undeveloped, unwanted, unloved. Let s hope this is the first sign of a big turnaround on that front.With the OPC badge sitting atop of the performance ladder at Opel, it becomes obvious that a lesser, more accessible performance range is needed to contest mid-segments. And thus, the return of GSi.In the Insignia then, it makes 191kW of power and 400Nm of torque from a 2.0-litre turbo engine. The motor is accessed via an 8-speed automatic gearbox with paddles behind the steering wheel.What is most interesting, however, is that Opel will also be testing the performance diesel market by introducing the GSi badge in a powerful diesel engine.Although no details are available on this yet, it should directly compete with the same motor used by the likes of Golf GTD.While the Insignia looks to be a highly capable family sedan, there is almost zero percent chance that it will come to Mzansi, unless there is a significant strengthening of the Rand fairly soon.IN4RIDE

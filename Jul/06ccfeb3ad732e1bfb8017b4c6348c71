JOHANNESBURG - South Africa s Lions showed their entire array of skills to batter the Japanese Sunwolves into submission with a thumping 94-7 victory in their Super Rugby clash at Ellis Park on Saturday.The Lions ran in 14 tries to equal the tournament record for a single game as they picked apart the dismal defence of the visitors, who will have plenty of soul-searching to do after such a harrowing defeat.

Credit the persistence and strength of the loose-forward, but the defence from the visitors was abysmal.Sensing blood, given their dominant opening 20 minutes, the Lions then ran a ball from inside their own 22 with an excellent move that ended with Smith scoring the try.Smith then added another and flyhalf Elton Jantjies got in on the action as the home side went into halftime leading 35-0.The carnage continued in the second period, with hooker Armand van der Merwe finishing another rampaging Lions attack, before Combrink broke the Sunwolves line far too easily to score.The visitors were flailing and from the kick-off the Lions launched another savage attack that saw Kriel grab his second, before Combrink was put into space by a long pass and crossed easily for a ninth try inside an hour.

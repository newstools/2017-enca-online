LONDON - British milkmen could be a thing of the past in some areas if a trial of driverless grocery deliveries direct to residents' doors by online retailer Ocado got the green light.Over the past two weeks, the company used a self-driving vehicle with eight containers, which can carry 128kg of groceries to deliver coffee, chocolate and other goods."It seemed like a really exciting experience", Tobie Cusson said of the CargoPod trial in South London, which involved choosing from a selection of healthy treats, a collection of movie night snacks or high-end coffee and chocolates."I despise paying delivery fees when I order online so any types of technology that can reduce the cost of providing a delivery service are very attractive to me," Cusson added.When the CargoPod arrived, a container lit up and was opened at the push of a button, technology that Ocado said could be rolled out globally to traditional retailers within a decade.READ: Waymo teams with Avis to keep self-driving cars goingThe vehicle included cameras and LiDAR sensors - which measured the distance to a target by illuminating it with a pulsed laser light - to detect any obstacles.For the trials, a safety driver and Ocado delivery person were on also on board, but Ocado s Chief Technology Officer Paul Clarke said the technology would be in place to roll out driverless deliveries by 2021."It's not going to become ubiquitous but there are certain areas where it makes sense to do this," Clarke said, adding that Ocado would need to see how potential barriers in legislation and insurance developed.Last month, the UK government outlined plans for an Automated and Electrical Vehicles Bill which was aimed at boosting the self-driving industry, which it said would be worth $36.3-billion (about R480-billion) by 2035.Reuters

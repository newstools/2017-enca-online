That relationship that we were describing will apply whether its Indian or whatever other categories you can think about," Netshitenzhe said. Netshitenzhe: The ANC's relationship with monopoly is of cooperation and contestation.

If the ANC does not experience the turnaround it will not be able to construct that national democratic society that it aspires to." #ANCNPC Febe: The powers of the ANC Integrity Committee must be strengthened. Ppl should also be suspended while facing disciplinary action. eNCA

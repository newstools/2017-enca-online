JOHANNESBURG â€“ Gupta-linked Trillian Capital has responded to claims by McKinsey over an apparent deal with Eskom. Trillian says it was a supplier development partner for business consultants McKinsey. The company says it also sat in meetings with McKinsey and Eskom as required by a service agreement. McKinsey has denied that it subcontracted a turnaround strategy project at the parastatal to Trillian. READ: Eskom's lies, lies, and more lies But Trillian says it has documents that prove Mckinsey was aware of and endorsed its work. The company claims that as part of an agreement with McKinsey, it sent a team to the Majuba power station in Mpumalanga. Earlier this week Eskom admitted that it had paid Trillian almost R500-million in consultancy fees. Media reports last week said leaked emails suggested that McKinsey had authorised Eskom to pay Trillian as a subcontractor, in a bid to win a contract with the power utility. eNCA

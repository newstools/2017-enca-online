JOHANNESBURG - Lobby group Black First Land First (BLF) says it won't back down from threats against what it calls defenders of white monopoly capital.The group has issued a target list of journalists it accuses of racism and promoting a white agenda.Editor-at-large for Tiso Blackstar Media Group Peter Bruce, Business Day editor Tim Cohen News-24 editor Addriaan Basson, and EWN's Barry Bateman are just some of the journalists who have been accused by BLF of pushing a white agenda, peddling fake news and covering up white corruption.On Thursday, the organisation picketed outside Bruce's house in Johannesburg and even came to blows with some journalists.But the organisation insists it has made no threats.Black First Land First Spokesperson Zanele Lwama said, "As the Black First Land Land First movement we have not threatened any journalist, we have not made any death threats."What we have said is we are not going to tolerate any white journalists who are in cahoots with white settler monopoly capital in this country who continue to write fake news and peddle lies in this country and tell lies about black people in this country. In doing so they ignore the corruption that happens in white businesses in this country."Despite a South African National Editor's Forum ultimatum to stop harassing and intimidating journalists or face legal action by midday on Saturday, BLF has refused to retract threats against journalists it accuses of being agents of white monopoly capital, but instead vowed to intensify protests against those it says are against transformation."It is our constitutional right as a movement to protest. We are not going to be intimidated by the SA editors forum in to legal lynching process. If they want to go to court they can go ahead, we are going to intensify our action in this week going forward," said Lwama.One of the journalists on the organisation s list says the group is confusing the national agenda.Political Analyst Karima Brown said, "I think the Black First Land First organisation isn't a political movement. It's a group of hired thugs for the Zuma faction and I think they're also in the employ of the Gupta family.READ: BLF attacks peaceful protesters outside Gupta event: JAI"When they spoke with eNCA about why they went to intimidate Peter Bruce, the former editor of Business Day a couple of days ago, they said they were there to protect the president because he's Black and to protect the Gupta's because they're Black."So what you have here is a right-wing ultra nationalist organisation that is race baiting journalists and opponents that they believe are servicing this phony narrative that they're trying to put into the SA political agenda, white monopoly capital." Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo also criticised the attacks. She said, It's a reflection of the type of intolerance that we experience in SA today. But it also speaks to the high levels of violence that we see in our society today. One would love to see a society where journalists are able to go and dig for stories without feeling unsafe .BLF has also issued veiled threats against black journalists it believes are agents of white capital.eNCA

DETROIT, Michigan - Baidu Inc, the top Chinese internet search firm, had formed a broad alliance to promote self-driving cars, pitting its Apollo platform against Alphabet Inc's system, it said on Wednesday, in hopes of getting the vehicles on the road in China by 2019.The alliance included partnerships with automakers, suppliers, startups, universities and local governments and was built around Baidu's Apollo self-driving platform, which was developed at its tech centre in California's Silicon Valley. Apollo was aimed at Alphabet's Waymo self-driving package.Among the key development partners on Apollo were Nvidia Corp, which specialised in microprocessors and artificial intelligence, and mapping expert TomTom NV.Ford Motor Co and Daimler AG also were partners, Baidu said, as well as supplier Delphi Automotive and chipmaker Intel Corp.READ: Could Apple's next big thing be a carBaidu said at a briefing in Beijing it was partnering with five Chinese vehicle manufacturers, including Chery Automobile, BAIC Motor, FAW Group Corp, Chongqing Changan Automobile and Great Wall Motor. All but Great Wall were state-owned.German suppliers Robert Bosch, Continental Automotive and ZF Friedrichshafen were also part of the alliance.Baidu had said its goal was to get self-driving vehicles on the road in China, possibly by 2019, and eventually in other markets, including the United States.Baidu was an investor in Nio, a Silicon Valley electric vehicle start-up also backed by China's Tencent Holdings and Lenovo. Nio hoped to put its first self-driving cars on US roads in 2020.Two weeks ago, top officials from Baidu and Chery met in Silicon Valley to sign an agreement to collaborate on the development of intelligent, internet-connected vehicles, according to a source familiar with the companies' plans.Chery had installed Baidu's self-driving software in several prototype cars in China and they could further deepen their relationship to include manufacturing.Reuters

 JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday afternoon addressed the media on the outcomes of the African National Congress (ANC) National Policy Conference (NPC) 2017.Zuma said that the movement had emerged from the conference more united than before. We emerge out of this policy conference much wiser and better in the understanding of our strengths and weaknesses. We have a keen understanding of our challenges and how to overcome them."We also emerge out of this conference more united in purpose than when we came here. We are much clearer and remain committed to the fact what that unites us is more important than what divides us, he said. President Zuma said that the policy conference had shown that it was okay to disagree about issues. This conference strengthened the culture of robust internal debate in the ANC, anchored on the principle that we can disagree without being disagreeable. After all we are not enemies, we are comrades," said Zuma. The president also railed against the factionalism in the organisation. He said the party needed to find a better way to choose leaders. He suggested that if two people contest for the presidency, that the losing candidate becomes deputy-president. If we have 2 comrades, and one wins, let us not get rid of the one who did not win. Let us make the one who didn t win become deputy of the one who is leading. This will have the effect that both factions will come together and work together... In other words, we move away from where we say this comrade has lost... It s a destructive system which doesn t help the ANC . Earlier, National Executive Committee (NEC) member, Lindiwe Sisulu said social transformation was as important as economic transformation. Sisulu also said legislation against hate crime must be prioritised."We would like to ensure that we legislate against hate crime, legislated as a priority legislation....its new manifestation."Read - ANC in Gauteng pushes to decriminalise prostitution eNCA

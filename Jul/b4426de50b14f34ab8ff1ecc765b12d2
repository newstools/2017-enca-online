*To view the ANC stalwarts new appeal to the party, as well as their original appeal to the leadership on 25 October, 2016, go to the bottom of the article.JOHANNESBURG - The ANC stalwarts and veterans on 1 July published on their Facebook page the document they presented to the President and the ANC's top five officials on October 25, 2016.At the same time, the stalwarts and veterans released a new plea to be empowered to convene and facilitate a National Consultative Conference in order to effect the renewal of the organisation.Included among the stalwarts are all the remaining members of the Rivonia Treason Trial. Ahmed Kathrada was the documents first signatory.The stalwarts noted that they remain loyal members of the ANC, and wish to "continue to serve all the people of South Africa and ensure the historical values and principlesof the ANC are restored."They noted their shock at being attacked by President Zuma at the ANC NEC and reject his assertions with regards to their motivations as patently untrue. The ANC Stalwarts and Veterans Facebook page presented the stalwarts 27 point document, detailing their commitment to the organisation, and to "the principles that have been the hallmark of the ANC for over one hundred years."GALLERY: Liberation stalwarts out in force for Kathrada memorialThey noted the challenges, divisions and splits that had occurred during the ANC's history and noted that on all occasions, "Its leadership, cadres and members rose to the occasion - protecting, defending and upholding the core values of the ANC." The stalwarts noted that they had spoken out about "departures from the ANC s values, and (had) counselled a process of introspection."They had "recently watched as the ANC abdicated its historically earned position as the leader of society to opposition parties and other civil society entities... (had) observed the ill-begotten wealth among some of our leaders at all levels and the resulting ruinous effects on the organisation s moral and political fabric and on society as a whole, (and had) watched as the leadership of the ANC became mired in a cycle of in-fighting occasioned not by any ideological or political difference but personal interest."They noted that these factors had contributed significantly to the increase in political assassinations and had noted that the NEC had accepted collective responsibility for recent electoral defeats.But they cautioned "against the constant refrain that the ANC has the inherent ability to self-correct." They said this led to complacency and disinclined the party from taking the necessary corrective measures. The stalwarts noted that the ANC leadership had failed the people of South Africa by presiding "over the downward spiral of the organisation and... defending... the personal interests of some leaders at the expense of the public good and the credibility of the organisation."LETTER: ANC has drifted from ideals of struggle stalwartsThe veterans said action was required. The stated that they "must be empowered to convene and facilitate a National Consultative Conference, similar in structure to the historic Morogoro Consultative Conference. The Consultative Conference must reflect on all aspects of the state of the organisation and prepare for the 2017 National Conference."The Conference will also need to discuss the selection and election of credible leaders free of blemishes, factionalism and corruption based on the precepts expounded in the ANC document Through the eye of the Needle . The deliberations and resolutions of the Conference should contribute to the leadership that leads the ANC to the next national election."Their objectives and next steps, they stated, would be to call for the consultative conference prior to the 2017 elective conference; to create a credible ANC platform; To call for all genuine members of the ANC from all walks of life and structures, to return to the branches of the ANC; To ensure that elected leaders are not products of manipulated elections; to ensure that the elective conference would begin the process of renewal for the ANC and also mark the beginning of the process to win back the confidence of the people ; to work with the ANC Youth League in order to motivate young people to support the ANC; to build worker unity; to protect and defend state entities; and to rid the organisation of corruption, ill-discipline, factionalism, arrogance, abuse of state power and resources.READ: Zuma must go - ANC stalwarts throw down the gauntletThe stalwarts noted that their "collective political and organisational experience... as cadres committed to improving the quality of discourse in the ANC and to promote purposeful dialogue with all sectors of South African society" was at the disposal of the ANC in realising these objectives.The document below was released by the stalwarts on 1 July, 2017.For the Sake of Our Future by eNCA.com on Scribd The document below was delivered to the leadership of the ANC on 25 October, 2016.The Anc Stalwarts Document Presented to the President and the Top Five Officials of the ANC by eNCA.com on Scribd eNCA

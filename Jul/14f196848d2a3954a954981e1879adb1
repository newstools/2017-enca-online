JOHANNESBURG A 51-year-old Randfontein man, who was found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting his stepdaughters, was sentenced to life behind bars.In February, Johannesburg High Court Judge Cassim Moosa found the man guilty of rape and indecent assault of his two stepdaughters, over a period of seven years.The man cannot be named to protect the identity of the victims.Moosa said the man chose to shatter the trust of his stepdaughters, despite them loving him as their father.The rapes were only discovered when the sisters confided in their school counsellor after their mother would not help them. The mother's defence in court was that she was not a confrontational person and did not know how to address the matter with her husband.The mother had witnessed the man putting his hands in the underwear of one of her daughters, but failed to question him about his misconduct.READ: The horrors women and children faced over the past 15 years The accused has shown no remorse during the trial and turned his stepdaughters into his wives and had regular sexual intercourse with them, the judge found.During the trial, the sisters told the court that they initially kept quiet about what was happening because they thought all young girls experienced the same thing at their homes.The girls only found the courage to speak out after a friend of theirs, who was experiencing the same abuse, told them that it was wrong. He failed dismally as a father and has left his family destitute, Moosa said.Moosa found the effects of the continued assault and rape on one of the girls resulted in her having anxiety, fear, trust issues, suicidal tendencies and promiscuous behaviour at a young age. Hardly a day passes without a report in the media about a woman or child being raped and abused, Moosa said. I m of the view that no compelling circumstances have been provided to deviate from the minimum prescribed sentence of life imprisonment.

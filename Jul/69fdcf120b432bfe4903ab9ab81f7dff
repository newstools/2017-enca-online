JOHANNESBURG – The songs sung by various groups of ANC delegates were yet another indication of the divisions within the party. On Friday, party members used music to show how they felt about the issues that would be discussed at the party’s National Policy Conference (NPC), taking place in Nasrec. Song and dance were an integral part of ANC events, even as the organisation morphed from a liberation movement to a governing party. Some delegates sang songs in praise of the party and its leader President Jacob Zuma, while others expressed a desire for a change in leadership. One group of attendees sang ANC kuzolawul’ wena, which means “ANC you will rule.” The ANC had been besieged by disunity and factional battles, reflected by the ANC's North West delegation which sang Silamulel’ Tambo meaning “Intervene Tambo.” North West delegates #ANCNPC pic.twitter.com/qJNHKiin0o Delegates from the Eastern Cape performed Usheshe washo, Zinsiwa zilelekule dawo.

Just before proceedings got underway, a group belted out Asiphelelanga, kushoda umnotho, translated into “We aren't satisfied, we need economic liberation.” Asiphelelanga, kushoda umnotho - #ANCNCP delegates sing. #ANCPolicy17 pic.twitter.com/zm5DVm53cL eNCA

CAPE TOWN The government s latest bailout of South African Airways (SAA) makes no difference to the cash crisis at the airline, the Democratic Alliance (DA) says. This emergency funding for SAA indicates the serious crisis that it has been mismanaged into," said DA spokesman Alf Lees."SAA is losing in the region of R370-million every month and is apparently scratching for cash to pay salaries.READ: Ailing SAA gets R2.3-billion financial bailoutIt was deeply ironic that it had been necessary to announce a R2.3-billion bailout for the national airline in the middle of the ANC s national policy conference, which was heavily focused on economic policy, including stabilising zombie state-owned enterprises such as South African Airways , Lees said. [Saturday's] announcement that SAA has been bailed out from the National Revenue Fund [NRF] to pay Standard Chartered Bank the loan amount of R 2.207-billion is a blow to the credibility of both the SAA board and to National Treasury. Only three days ago when I asked National Treasury whether they were ready to meet the guarantee obligations both SAA and National Treasury reassured the parliamentary standing committee on finance that the plans were in place to meet the R9-billion SAA loan payments by 30 June 2017. This was clearly not the case, he said.READ: SAA board faces criminal charges Standard Chartered Bank evidently has no faith in the leadership, management, and strategy of SAA," Lees said.He noted that the payment to Standard Chartered had been made in terms of section 16 of the Public Finance Management Act, which required that such a payment be reported to Parliament within 14 days and be included in an adjustments budget within 120 days of the minister authorising the expenditure. We look forward to the minister s report to Parliament within 14 days. This report must give details of why this expenditure was authorised as being an emergency situation, Lees said.African News Agency

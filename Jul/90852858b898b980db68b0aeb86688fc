LONDON Moeen Ali took six wickets as England beat South Africa by 211 runs to win the first Test at Lord's with more than a day to spare on Sunday.The Proteas, set 331 to win, collapsed to 119 all out inside 37 overs.The result meant Joe Root, who made 190 in the hosts' first innings 458, enjoyed a resounding victory in his first Test as England captain, with his side now 1-0 up in this four-match series.READ: Morkel strikes twice to lead Proteas fightbackOff-spinner Ali, the man-of-the-match, finished with Test-best figures of six for 53 in 15 overs -- including a burst of five for 20 in 25 balls -- on a pitch offering sharp turn.No South Africa batsman made more in the innings than Temba Bavuma's 21. YEEEESSS! ENGLAND WIN by 211 runs! #ENGvSAhttps://t.co/aoH97zJNWp pic.twitter.com/w7XQqQNO87 England collapseThe day started well for South Africa as England, who resumed on 119 for one in their second innings, lost seven wickets before lunch in a dramatic collapse.But in the midst of the clatter of wickets, Vernon Philander dropped a routine catch at long-off when Jonny Bairstow, mistiming a drive off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, was on seven.Bairstow punished the Proteas by making 51 before he was last man out in a total of 233, stumped by opposing wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock off Maharaj.The scale of South Africa's task could be seen from the fact that only once, when the West Indies posted 344 for one against England in 1984, had a side made more than 300 in the fourth innings to win a Lord's Test.Bairstow, the son of late former England wicket-keeper David Bairstow, has often been criticised for the quality of his glovework. WICKET! Stop it, @MoeenAli! TEN in the match and six in the innings!

All over at Lord's where Morkel is the last man out, dismissed by Dawson for 14. SA go down 1-0 in the 4-match series #ENGvSA pic.twitter.com/za6PtREhQ3 Former England captain Alastair Cook was 59 not out overnight and Gary Ballance unbeaten on 34.The pair found runs hard to come by against a South Africa attack now back to full strength with Philander returning having been unable to bowl Saturday having been hit on the hand while batting.When Rabada had Ben Stokes plumb lbw he jokingly put a finger to his lips -- a reference to his ban from Friday's second Test at Trent Bridge for swearing at the all-rounder after dismissing him in England's first innings.But it was England who had the last laugh on a remarkable day at Lord's that saw 19 wickets fall in total. WICKET! FIVE wickets for @MoeenAli brilliant bowling! Live: https://t.co/aoH97zJNWp pic.twitter.com/cPPLBhbqL4 AFP

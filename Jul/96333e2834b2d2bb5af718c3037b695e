JOHANNESBURG EFF leader Julius Malema labelled Ntsiki Mazwai a failed poet and she said she would "pass on the EFF" if the party was dominated by Malema.In a heated Twitter argument on Sunday night the EFF commander-in-chief retorted that he did not need the endorsement of any failed poet to succeed.Malema said he was good at politics unlike Mazwai in her career endeavours. I think this tweet by @ntsikimazwai started it all. Julius will drag her for days------ pic.twitter.com/mtNofAvlHY I don't need an endorsement of any failed poet to succeed, politics is my game & I know it. At least I'm good at what I'm doing unlike you Tweeting about Juju all the time & not about your work or profession, as if Julius is your job description. I don't need you or ur friends Wa mphaphela moloi But why dm me about my performance and explaining yourself if I'm so wack? Gtfoh pic.twitter.com/xrSq3gtOuk eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel threw his weight behind calls to slash high data costs in South Africa.South Africa s data costs were reportedly over 10 times higher than in neighbouring countries.The minister made the comments on Monday, while addressing the Progressive Business Forum at the ANC s policy conference. We know we are a data-driven society," Patel told the audience. "That the 21st century is the century of data."What the oil and steel was to the 20th century, our cellphones, laptops, and information technologies that we use will be the critical fuel. Data costs must come down. I think all South Africans will agree to that. "The cause was championed in September last year by CEO of Touch Central and former MetroFM presenter Thabo Tbo Touch Molefe.He took to Twitter using the hashtag #DataMustfall, to call for lower prices from cellphone networks.Last month, Twitter users called for a day's social media blackout to try and force cellular providers to drop their data fees.Now, Patel was eager for government to play a role in investigating the market."We have launched a market enquiry and I can see both here, and among the attendees at the breakfast and I m sure all South Africans sitting at home, want to pay less for data on their cellphones and laptops."So we are going to have a market enquiry where the competition authorities will lift the lid, find out what is happening to prices, how do we compare with international players, how can we bring data costs down? What are the recommendations we need to look at? eNCA

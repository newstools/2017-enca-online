"From 31 August, existing uncapped customers will automatically be upgraded to the new Unlimited Home Plans at higher speeds. Customers will be upgraded from 2Mbps to 4Mbps and from 4Mbps to 8Mbps or 10Mbps respectively," read an excerpt of the company's press release. Maqetuka told Memeburn that capped accounts will still be available to purchase from Telkom, but that the new packages represented a "journey to move them [capped account-holders - ed] to uncapped". The move comes roughly a year after Telkom's mobile arm revealed its FreeMe packages, starting at R99 for 1GB of mobile data and zero-rated on-network calls. Memeburn

JOHANNESBURG - Disciplinary proceedings against suspended SABC acting Chief Executive, James Aguma will resume on Tuesday. Aguma is accused of providing false information under oath, during the disciplinary hearing of former Chief Operating Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng.Motsoeneng was nonetheless found guilty of bringing the public broadcaster into disrepute and was subsequently fired. READ: SABC board chair says employees have been to hell and backThe SABC's interim board suspended Aguma in May, pending a probe into alleged tender irregularities and wasteful expenditure under his watch.One of the allegations against Aguma is that he lied when he said the board did not resolve that Motsoeneng should be disciplined, even though he was present at the meeting where that decision was taken. Another reason is that he allegedly gave Motsoeneng permission to hold a press conference in March, even while the latter was on suspension. Aguma told Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Communications this was not true.In May, Parliament's legal advisor said the process of identifying witnesses, who allegedly lied during a Parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of the SABC was well under way. eNCA

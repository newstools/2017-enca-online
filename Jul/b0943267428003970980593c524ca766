Rest in peace to legendary Cape Town jazz maestro Errol Dyers :( We will always remember you with music in our hearts pic.twitter.com/K3GxYmhDQ5</a> "It was the height of apartheid so here was a coloured group playing the best in the world and I think that was that moment that really twisted you," said music journalist, Gary van Dyk.Scores of jazz musicians, including his brother and fellow jazz guitarist Alivn Dyers, paid tribute to their fallen maestro."I feel like the music industry has been robbed, totally. Big time. He's leaving. There's such a huge gap that is now left. He was the only guy who was just staying true to the music and keeping it going you know, especially the Ghoema stuff," he said.Several benefit concerts have been held in the past to raise funds for Dyers' treatment and medical bills.His death has, again, raised concerns about an apparent lack of support for local musicians from the government."I'm hoping that government will come on board and that they will support the music and the creative arts in the future because this is Errol, the very same thing happened with Robbie Jansen and we needed funding," said Glenn Robertson from African Music Trust.Dyers will be laid to rest on Saturday. eNCA

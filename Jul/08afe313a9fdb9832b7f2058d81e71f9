JOHANNESBURG - Absa bank has been granted an urgent interdict against the Gupta-linked Black First Land First (BLF) group after its branch in the Johannesburg CBD was stoned. At least one customer was confirmed injured in the incident, suffering a broken hand. On Thursday, the BLF vowed to continue protesting against any journalists it deems racist. READ - Judge to rule on Sanef application on Friday The BLF appeared in court on Thursday over allegations that it was threatening journalists reporting on the Gupta family. The South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) applied for an urgent interdict against the group in a bid to prevent protests at the homes of journalists. A ruling on this matter is to be made on Friday. BLF is accusing Sanef of protecting white corruption. Political analyst Karima Brown and Business Day editor Tim Cohen were assaulted, allegedly by BLF members, outside the home of Tiso Blackstar editor-at-large Peter Bruce where the BLF went to protest. BLF said Sanef should have approached the police before coming to court. “We are going to continue protesting against any racist journalists, we are not going to stop,” said Andile Mngxitama, BLF President. Mngxitama is representing BLF in court in opposing Absa's interdict request. eNCA

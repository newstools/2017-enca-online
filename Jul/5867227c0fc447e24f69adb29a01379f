JOHANNESBURG - The Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa (BCCSA) has reprimanded radio station 702 for contravening clause 13 of the Broadcasting Code. The BCCSA was particularly damning of the role played by 702 host Eusebius McKaiser in creating "a hostile environment" on his programme focusing on former President De Klerk, which the commission considered to be a matter of public importance.

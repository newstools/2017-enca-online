JOHANNESBURG – The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has laid charges of treason against former Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi. Outa said Muthambi, now the minister of Public Service and Administration is involved in “state capture and has been “captured” by the Guptas.” WATCH: OUTA reveals dossier on state capture “Her transgressions are so serious that this merits treason charges. Charges were laid at the Brixton police station in Johannesburg,”Outa said in a statement. “When the court finds Faith Muthambi guilty, this should mean a sentence of life imprisonment,” said Dominique Msibi, Outa’s Portfolio Director for Special Projects. In 2015, the Western Cape High Court found that Muthambi acted irrationally and unlawfully in her appointment of Hlaudi Motsoeneng as Chief Operating Officer of the SABC because of the Public Protector’s findings against him of abuses of power, fraud and maladministration. READ: 'I do not run SABC': Faith Muthambi Outa said Muthambi’s abuse of power led to the SABC’s current financial crisis. It said the #GuptaLeaks emails reveal further evidence of disgraceful and illegal behaviour by Muthambi. “Faith Muthambi knowingly and deliberately shared three confidential Cabinet memoranda, through emails with Tony Gupta, Duduzane Zuma and Sahara’s CEO Ashu Chawla. These people should never have been privy to any ministerial communication and policy discussions,” said Msibi. A series of emails which Muthambi sent to Tony Gupta on matters of executive policy and the scope of her ministerial powers is alarming.

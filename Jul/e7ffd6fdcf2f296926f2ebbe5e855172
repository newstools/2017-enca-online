JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says a breakdown in wage negotiations with employers in the metal and engineering sector has led to threats of strike action. The union represents over a hundred-and-forty-thousand workers. According to Phakamile Hlubi, acting Numsa spoesperson, "We really find ourselves pretty much at the point of no return." READ - Numsa, engineering sector deadlocked on wage agreements "Wage talks between ourselves and the employer began in early June. We deadlocked already by the middle of June and since then we've been engaged with four wage talks that have failed. Essentially, we're very far apart on the demands that have been placed on the table. First of all, Numsa has made a demand of 15% across the board. There's also proposals which the employer has placed on the table which for us we really can't accept because they would result in workers' conditions worsening and not improving," says Hlubi. Numsa  says discussions around a minimum wage in the industry also contributed to a threatened strike. "It's created a real problem for us and this is precisely the issue that we'd raised initially when discussions around the establishment of a national minimum wage we'd already raised these issues. In engineering Numsa has worked really hard to secure a minimum rate of R40 an hour and what's happening now is that employers are actually trying to erode that benefit and all of that hard work. And what they've put on the table is that they want workers who are coming into the sector, young new workers, to earn half of that which is R20 an hour. That is effectively what has brought us to the point where we are now on the verge of a national shut down.," says Hlubi.

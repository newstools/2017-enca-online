SUN CITY, SOUTH AFRICA - A tension-fuelled weigh-in took place at Sun City on Friday, ahead of EFC 61 on Saturday night.Heavyweight champion Andrew van Zyl defends his title against undefeated challenger Wessel Mostert. Van Zyl is the most decorated athlete on the EFC roster and let his opponent know it. He s a young, hungry lion, said Van Zyl. But I am better than him in every aspect of the game. #EFC61: "I'm better than him in any facet of the game." - @Andrew_vanzyl1 #"I'm fitter, stronger and faster than I have ever been. The belt will be mine," replied Mostert.The DRC s ChampionDalcha defends his light heavyweight title. Activity in the arena screeched to a standstill when Dalcha emerged and his men from the Congo began chanting."I'm so excited to be back in the hexagon. I'm ready to keep my belt." - @lungiambula #EFC61Hailing from France and having stepped onto African shores for the first time only one week ago, Alan Baudot seemed visibly surprised at the intense adulation Dalcha enjoys, an almost mystical bond with his supporters. I m ready to keep my belt and put on a show, said Dalcha. It s not about the words. It s about what you do in the Hexagon. Surveying the baying crowd Badout replied quietly, but confidently. My hands talk more than my mouth does, we ll see tomorrow night. #TheClinch: "My hands talk more than my mouth does, we'll see." - @AlanBaudot #EFC61 He raised one fist to the crowd. It seemed a sign of respect to the men from the Congo, as well as a warning.Another African newcomer, Englishman Stuart Austin, stepped out to face-off against former all African boxing champion Elvis Moyo(Zimbabwe).The youthful Austin has absorbed a ton of teasing from the Zimbabwean in the build up, and taken it in his good-natured stride. But all fun left the eyes of both when it came time to face-off. This is the match you want to watch, said Austin during the week s build-up. The crowd seemed to agree. A record three different athletes broke their composure and pushed their opponent during their face-off, such was the intensity of the event. One of these was Kanyeba Anicet vs former bantamweight title challenger Alain Ilunga. Their bout has a long history of on and off, and with it growing bad blood. It spilled over. They jumped at each other, security diving in to separate them. Due to a late fight cancellation relative EFC newcomers Faeez Jacobs and Kevin Pheko receive a dream bump-up to the main card. Both were super-charged at weigh-in, both are thrilling strike specialists, each is motivated to deliver a beautiful fight tomorrow night. One athlete failed to make weight. Tresor Boluwa opted for a financial penalty.The official EFC 61 weigh-in results are as follows:Fight 1: FeatherweightLuthando Biko 65.75kgClaude Ntumba 65.90kgFight 2: WelterweightGunther Kalunda 76.15kgFrancois Cundari 76.65kgFight 3: WelterweightTresor Boluwa 79.05kgPietie Coxen 76.80kgFight 4: FlyweightRadley De Vries 56.75kgJosemar Octavio 56.55kgFight 5: LightweightTshilumba Mikixi 68.90kgRodrique Kena 67.90kgFight 6: Light HeavyweightRoelof Scheepers 91.80kgWarren Allison 92.45kgFight 7: CatchweightRegis Muyambo 67.45kgOumpie Sebeko 67.95kg Fight 8: BantamweightKevin Pheko 60.85kgFaeez Jacobs 59.95kgFight 9: CatchweightAnicet Kanyeba 71.60kgAlain Ilunga 72.65kgFight 10: HeavyweightStuart Austin 103.95kgElvis Moyo 118.45kgFight 11: Light Heavyweight Title FightAlan Baudot 93.05kgChampion Dalcha 92.30kgFight 12: Heavyweight Title FightWessel Mostert 119.65kgAndrew van Zyl 118.65kg - Contributor EFC WorldwideeNCA

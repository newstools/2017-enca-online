THE HAGUE, Netherlands - European and Japanese scientists on Thursday proudly unveiled the BepiColombo spacecraft ahead of its seven-year journey to Mercury, to explore one of the Solar System's most enigmatic planets.Set for launch in 2018, BepiColombo would be the European Space Agency's (ESA) first mission to the closest rock to the Sun.The craft had an unusual design, comprising a "stacked aircraft" carrying two orbiters - one European, the other Japanese - which would separate on arrival to go into different, but complementary orbits around Mercury.BepiColombo aimed to "follow up on many of the intriguing results of NASA's Messenger mission, probing deeper into Mercury's mysteries than ever before," the ESA said.The joint project with the Japanese agency JAXA, which had cost more than 1.3 billion euros (R19.8-billion), involved some 33 companies from 12 EU nations, as well as firms from the US and Japan.It had been delayed several times, but the mission chiefs were now confident that it was on track to launch in October next year.READ: The seven most extreme planets ever discoveredMercury was the "most peculiar of all rocky planets," Alvaro Gimenez, ESA's director of science told reporters at the agency's centre in the Dutch coastal town of Noordwijk.Its surface was wracked by extreme temperatures, ranging from -180 to 450 degrees Celsius."Entering a pizza oven"It also had a magnetic field, the only rocky planet besides Earth to have one.But Mercury was so weak that the field did not provide a shield against solar radiation.It orbited just 58 million kilometres from the Sun, and its surface was blasted by radiation levels that would destroy earthly lifeforms.Its proximity to the Sun also made Mercury hard to study from Earth because the brightness impeded the view. The Sun's huge gravity also made it difficult to put a craft into steady orbit around the planet.READ: NASA discovers 10 new Earth-size exoplanetsThe high temperatures presented tricky challenges for the engineers, which included the European aircraft designer Airbus, and added to project delays, mission chiefs said.Airbus said it had covered the European orbiter with specially-designed "high-temperature multi-layered insulation" which is "made up of 50 layers of ceramics and aluminium," while the antennae were "made of heat-resistant titanium, covered by a newly-developed coating.""We are flying into a pizza oven which is why we had to test materials at a very high and different temperature rates. Sometimes with very unwanted results," said Ulrich Reininghaus, the ESA BepiColombo project manager."Most complicated ever"So far only two NASA missions had visited Mercury - Mariner 10 in the 1970s and Messenger, which orbited the planet from 2011 until it ran out of fuel in April 2015.BepiColombo would study the peculiarities of Mercury's internal structure and magnetic field generation, and how it interacted with the Sun and solar wind.The Mercury mission was Europe's "most complicated ever," said Gimenez."It's difficult to get there, it's difficult to work there."READ: NASA spacecraft survives plunge between Saturn's ringsThe orbiters would seek to get as close as possible to the planet's surface, which was blasted by radiation levels 10 times higher than on the Sun and by temperatures hot enough to melt metal.The European orbiter was carrying 11 specially-designed instruments and the Japanese counterpart had five, which were set to explore Mercury's crater-pocked surface, enigmatic magnetism and tenuous, vestigial atmosphere.They planned to stay in orbit for at least one to two years, but scientists said it was possible the orbiters could last longer before crashing onto the planet's surface.Scientists would first seek to launch what they termed "a technological masterpiece" on October 5, 2018 from Kourou in French Guiana on the back of an Ariane rocket, with an eight-week launch window if there were any difficulties."Arrival at Mercury is first foreseen... on December 5, 2025," added Reininghaus.AFP

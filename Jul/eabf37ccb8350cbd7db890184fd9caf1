GBARI, Uganda Men wearing South Sudanese military uniforms launched two raids on a hamlet over the border in Uganda in recent weeks, residents said, stealing cattle and raising fears that a near four-year-old conflict was spreading.The gunmen also tried to seize refugees from Gbari, in the first reported attacks on Ugandan soil since the start of South Sudan's civil war, locals told Reuters."I am afraid, they may come... and burn all the houses," said Martin Koma (44) from the village.South Sudan's army denied any involvement.But the reports would alarm regional and world powers, struggling to contain ethnically-charged killings and atrocities that the UN warned could lead to genocide.South Sudanese gunmen had already killed and kidnapped hundreds in cross-border raids in Ethiopia.READ: Kiir opens South Sudan dialogue with unilateral ceasefireKoma said about 26 gunmen attacked Gbari on the morning of June 17, identifying themselves as South Sudanese military and taking 108 cattle.Three days later, a second group attacked and arrested two South Sudanese refugees living in the village."One ran away, the second one because... he looks like Dinka, they left him," Koma said. The military was dominated by the Dinka, the president's ethnic group.Koma said the gunmen were very hostile to the first man, from South Sudan's minority Kuku tribe, before he got away.Ugandan military spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire confirmed the raids on Gbari, without commenting on who carried them out.South Sudan's military denied involvement, saying it had received no complaint from Uganda and that the gunmen could have been anyone wearing South Sudanese uniforms."This is untrue," military spokesman Colonel Santo Domic Chol told Reuters. "This is completely negative propaganda by somebody... trying to tarnish the image of the (military)."AtrocitiesUN bodies and rights groups accused both Sudan's army and the rebel groups it was fighting of atrocities in the conflict that erupted just two years after South Sudan declared independence from Sudan.Fighting started spreading in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, fired his vice president and long-term rival, Riek Machar, a Nuer.READ: UN declares South Sudan, Africa's largest refugee crisisThe explosion of ethnic violence that followed uprooted nearly a quarter of the country's population of 12 million, creating the biggest refugee crisis since the genocide in Rwanda, another of Uganda's neighbours.Nearly a million South Sudanese fled to neighbouring Uganda, many from minority tribes. Ugandan authorities tightened security at refugee camps in recent days, fearing armed groups could try and abduct refugees from rival ethnic groups, police said."We have increased our intelligence and security alertness... because of signs some bad elements could want to cause insecurity in the camps," said Musiho Abubakar, the police commander in Uganda's northwestern Yumbe district.Last month, Ugandan soldiers shot a South Sudanese man they suspected of plotting to harm refugees, a security source in Yumbe said.

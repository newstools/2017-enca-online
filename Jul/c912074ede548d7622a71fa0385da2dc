JOHANNESBURG - Good food, good wine and good conversation. That's what life is about.I was fortunate enough to be part of an intimate group of foodies to experience a selection of Tsogo Sun's wines paired with winter tapas.Meeting at Southern Sun Hyde Park s Luc restaurant on a crisp winter afternoon, the foodies were ready to put their tastebuds to work.Gareth Jordaan, executive chef of Luc , paired winter tapas dishes with the six auction wines.To be honest, I have little knowledge of wines.Luckily Miguel Chan, Group Sommelier of Tsogo Sun, was on hand to explain how he and Gareth drew inspiration from the wines to create these special dishes."The objective was to showcase a diversity of styles in both white and red wines, covering the full spectrum of flavours," said Miguel.Each glass of wine tells its own story and Gareth excitedly explained how the two found, tested and tasted specific ingredients to build dishes around the wines.First on the menu was panco-crusted prawn with a ginger dipping sauce paired with Stellenrust Chenin Blanc 2012.First course: Panco-crusted prawn with a ginger dipping sauce paired with Stellenrust Chenin Blanc 2012 #tsogowineA post shared by Estelle Bronkhorst (@estellebronk) onMiguel explained that the Stellenrust Chenin Blanc 2012 goes well with crustaceans, thus the pairing with prawns.The ginger dipping sauce was de-li-cious and I saw many fellow diners trying to get the last bit of sauce from the shot glass.The second course was duck liver pat , cinnamon and Merlot jelly, coffee foam and pickled walnut paired with Nederburg Private Bin Merlot 2006.Second course: duck liver pate,cinnamon and Merlot jelly, coffee foam and pickled walnut paired with Nederburg Private Bin Merlot 2006 #tsogowineA post shared by Estelle Bronkhorst (@estellebronk) onMiguel said that with wine and food, you need something to constantly refresh your palate.And this is where the merlot comes in.It cleverly balanced out the richness of the pat .The coffee foam was a definite favourite!Gareth found his inspiration for the third dish while he was travelling in the USA.My favourite dish off the menu is the ultimate comfort food: Macaroni and cheese croquette with crisp pancetta, emental and rosemary bechamel paired with Groot Constantia CWG Chardonnay 2015.Third dish: the ultimate comfort food.

The simplicity in this pairing makes you think of mom's home-cooked meals.The fourth course can be described in three words: Flavour, flavour, flavour!Fourth course is flavour, flavour, flavour. Deboned stick pork rib with lentil salsa paired with Strydom The Expatriate Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz 2013. #tsogowineA post shared by Estelle Bronkhorst (@estellebronk) onThe deboned stick pork rib with lentil salsa was paired with Strydom The Expatriate Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz 2013.The younger red wine was spicy but rich and had an earthy element to it, packing the sweetness of the pork with oemf.Last but not least, Gareth's interpretation of a home-cooked meal.He paired sous vide chicken, ratatouille, squash pur e, walnut broccoli, basil with Nederburg Private Bin D 252 Sauvignon Blanc Semillon 2011.The melt-in-your-mouth chicken and elegant wine made for the perfect way to end the day.* Tsogo Sun has over 90 wines in their collection which have been accumulated over three years at the Nederburg and Cape Winemakers Guild auctions, and which are available at key properties within the group.eNCA

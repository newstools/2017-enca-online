The German has also been plagued recently by a hamstring injury and was beaten by Johanna Konta in the Eastbourne quarter-finals. Opponent Irina Falconi of the US is ranked 247 in the world and has lost all of her four previous first round matches at the All England Club.Del Potro, Kokkinakis in battle of woundedInteresting match-up between Argentine 29th seed Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion, and Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis.Both men have had injury-blighted careers with del Potro pushed to the brink of retirement through a wrist injury while Kokkinakis has battled a long-standing shoulder problem. The 21-year-old Australian is down at 486 in the rankings and lost on his debut appearance at Wimbledon in 2015.Jabeur eyes more historyQualifier Ons Jabeur of Tunisia is making her Wimbledon debut after becoming the first Arab woman to reach the third round of a Slam at Roland Garros in June having also had to qualify.Svetlana Kuznetsova is a two-time Grand Slam champion, lifting the trophy at the 2004 US Open and 2009 French Open. However, the Russian has never made it beyond the quarter-finals at Wimbledon with her most recent last-eight appearance coming 10 years ago.AFP

BAMAKO, Mali A new video, released by Al-Qaeda's Mali branch, provided proof-of-life of South African Stephen McGown and five other foreign hostages held by the group. The 16 minute-long video, by Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, also known as the Group to Support Islam and Muslims, was released on Telegram on Saturday, US-based monitoring group SITE said.The other hostages shown were elderly Australian surgeon Arthur Kenneth Elliott, Frenchwoman Sophie Petronin, Romanian Iulian Ghergut, Swiss missionary Beatrice Stockly and Colombian nun Gloria Cecilia Narvaez Argoti.No group had previously claimed responsibility for kidnapping Petronin, who was abducted in late 2016 by armed men in the northern Malian town of Gao, where she ran an organisation for malnourished children.READ: Mother of SA hostage held in Mali dies After a video clip showing Petronin, the narrator of the footage said she was hoping the French president would help return her to her family, according to SITE.The footage was released just before French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Mali on Sunday to consolidate Western backing for a regional anti-jihadist force.In the video, the hostages were separately introduced by a narrator, who said that so far there had been no negotiations for their release. The first hostage shown was McGown, who was abducted in Timbuktu, northern Mali, in November 2011.Al-Qaeda: Terror group in Mali releases video showing six foreign hostages alive https://t.co/Qb15RUCP6I pic.twitter.com/mBL0PyyVwr"It's a long time to be away... Until when do you think this will come to an end? Now we're making a new video, but I don't know what to say. It's all been said in the past. It's all been said in previous videos I've made," McGown said, according to a transcription by SITE.He was followed by Elliott, in his 80s, who, along with his wife Jocelyn, was abducted in January 2015 in Djibo, Burkina Faso, where the couple had run the sole medical clinic since 1972. Jocelyn was released in February last year.Next in the video was Romanian mineworker Ghergut, who said he was captured in Burkina Faso on April 4, 2015. The women were then shown, including Swiss missionary Stockly, who was kidnapped in Mali in January 2016.READ: Gift of the givers hopeful for Christmas release of hostages Colombian nun Argoti was seized by armed men in the Mali village of Karangasso close to the Burkina Faso border in February this year.At the end of the undated video, while not spelling out any demands, the narrator told the hostages' families "no genuine negotiations have begun" for their release but then added that negotiations are "still active".Last week, Swedish citizen, Johan Gustafsson, who was captured with McGown was released and told the McGown family he was alive and well.In 2012, Mali's north fell under the control of jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda who exploited an ethnic Tuareg-led rebel uprising, though the Islamists were largely ousted by a French-led military operation in January 2013.Since then, jihadists continued to mount numerous attacks on civilians and the army, as well as on French and UN forces stationed there.AFP

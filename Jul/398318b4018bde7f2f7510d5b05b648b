SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook was clamping on those spreading fake news on its platform.The social media giant said on Friday that it was changing the computer algorithm behind its News Feed, to limit the reach of people known to frequently blast out links to clickbait stories, sensationalist websites and misinformation.The move was another step by the world's largest social network to weed out spam, a battle Facebook had been fighting for years but that gained urgency after hoax news stories spread widely during last year's US presidential campaign.Facebook said the change would reduce the influence of a "tiny group" of people it had identified who shared vast amounts of low-quality public posts daily. Only about 0.1 percent of people who shared more than 50 posts a day fell into that category, the company said.The change would affect only links shared by those people, not their photos or other posts, the company said.READ: Tech giants join forces against terror content"Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively spamming people's feeds," said Adam Mosseri, Facebook's vice president for the News Feed, in a blog post.Ahead of the November 8 US presidential election, Facebook users saw false news reports saying Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead.The algorithm behind the News Feed determined which posts people saw from friends, advertisers and other sources, and the order in which they appeared, depending on how users responded to previous posts.Facebook, which had two billion monthly active users, frequently tweaked the computer code behind the News Feed.READ: Facebook takes aim at 'low quality' websitesThe latest tweak would have a negligible effect, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who monitored social media, adding that Facebook needed to hire more content moderators."Communications platforms used to employ a whole lot more humans, but what we've been led to believe now is that technology will solve everything," Grygiel said.In May, Facebook announced a change that gave lower prominence to links that led to pages full of deceptive or annoying ads.A change in August was designed to de-emphasise stories with clickbait-style headlines.Friday's change would de-prioritise links from specific spammers, Mosseri said.Reuters

JOHANNESBURG - Black First Land First (BLF) said on Thursday that the application by the SA National Editors Forum (Sanef) for an interdict against them was brought because journalists did not trust the police to do their job. Journalists running to court is abuse of the law, they are clearly saying they will go to court because they don t trust the South African Police Service (SAPS), Brandon Shabangu, the lawyer for BLF said in the South Gauteng High Court.Sanef's urgent application against Black First Land First was being heard by Judge Corrie van der Westhuizen.Tweets about #SANEF AND(FROM:@KhayaJames since:2017-07-06 until:2017-07-07) Sanef wants the court to interdict BLF and its founder, Andile Mngxitama, from harassing, intimidating and threatening journalists.READ: Sanef files urgent application against BLFSanef has asked the court to interdict BLF & Mngxitama from gathering outside the homes of these journalistsSanef asks the court to interdict the respondents from threatening these journalists with violence on social media...and from inciting harm against the journalists in any public interviews.On Thursday, the group BLF protested outside the home of Tiso Blackstar editor-at-large Peter Bruce, objecting to his columns critical of President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta family.It then issued a statement in which it listed a number of other journalists it was targeting, accusing them of protecting white corporate corruption.Shabangu told the court the application was not urgent as there had been only one protest and no other violent acts following that.We win the first round. Court rules that case is urgent & affirms the standing of @SAEditorsForum. Now we deal with merits. #SanefvsBLFHe said he failed to see what threat there was in people saying they would protest against white journalists who they felt were biased. No such outrage was seen when racist DA & Save SA thugs protested at home & the place of worship of the Gupta family. #BLFvsWhiteMediaStandard of acceptable protest was set by same racists who r now howling like hyenas when they taste their own medicine.#BLFvsWhiteMedia#SANEFvsBLF Judge Westhuizen states categorically you can't go to somebody's home, it's a private space.#SANEFvsBLF Westhuizen says it's one thing to criticise, once you have an intention that may involve act of criminality,thats different.eNCA

PRETORIA - President Jacob Zuma ordered the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to probe the Gauteng Health Department's handling of the Life Esidimeni tragedy, the Presidency said on Tuesday. The SIU would investigate the department's decision to procure and pay for the services of 28 unregistered non-governmental organisations, where over 100 mentally-ill patients died after the department decided to move them from a private healthcare facility. The probe came five months after Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba recommended that all the NGOs be shut down and that police investigate the patients deaths.READ: Esidimeni tragedy: Review board officials suspendedHe had also ordered that hundreds of patients who remained in the NGOs' care be moved to other facilities. The SIU investigation would look into allegations that the payments made to move these patients were not done in a manner that was fair, transparent and lawful, as well as the non-performance of the NGOs.The SIU was also tasked with looking into any unauthorised, irregular or fruitless and wasteful expenditure incurred by the department, serious maladministration, improper or unlawful conduct by officials or employees of the department, and unlawful, irregular or unapproved acquisitions and transactions that had a bearing on state property. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Weekend Wake-up's big interview on Sunday is with a man known for being outspoken, outrageous and highly entertaining. He found fame in the early 1990’s, performing in the musical Sarafina at age of 13. Nowadays Somizi Mhlongo is a household name.
	
	The Idols judge, choreographer and reality TV star has just released his book Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit; and it’s already a best seller. WATCH: Somizi's hilarious water campaign video Ayanda Allie-payne caught up with a more reflective and serious Somizi a little earlier this week. eNCA

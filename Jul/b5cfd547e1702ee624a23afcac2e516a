NEW YORK - Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) shares were up three percent in pre-market trading on Monday after the luxury electric-car maker said it would deliver its mass-market Model 3 sedan to the first 30 customers on July 28.The Model 3 sedan passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule, Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted late on Sunday.The announcement allayed worries about Tesla's ability to meet its production goals as earlier launches of its Model S sedan and Model X sports utility vehicle were plagued by delays and initial quality issues.READ: McLaren's All-New 720S Supercar lands in SA"Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500," Musk tweeted. bit.ly/2tBqMWbThe Palo Alto, California-based company planned to ramp up Model 3 production to reach a target 500,000 cars per year in 2018.

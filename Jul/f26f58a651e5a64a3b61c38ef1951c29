JOHANNESBURG Police Minister Fikile Mbalula holds a media briefing at OR Tambo International airport on Sunday after the return home of Princess Mahlangu, who fell victim to a human trafficking scam. The minister, head of the Hawks and the woman's family were at the airport to welcome her home from Malaysia. Mbalula learnt on Wednesday evening that the  24-year-old woman from Bloemfontein had been duped in an internet scam into going to Malaysia. She thought she was taking part in a modelling competition. The minister then enlisted the police, the Hawks and Interpol and the release of 14 women from various countries was effected. A suspect was arrested on Friday night. eNCA

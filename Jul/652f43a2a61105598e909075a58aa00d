CAPE TOWN - President Zuma told the ANCYL's Dullah Omar Region on Monday that Nelson Mandela was one of South Africa's greatest sons. He was addressing their inaugural Nelson Mandela Memorial Lecture. The address, which was expected to begin at 4pm, eventually kicked off at 8pm. The president said that young people can learn and be inspired by Madiba's life. "Indeed Madiba was one of the greatest sons of our country and our continent, from whose life we must continue to draw lessons and inspiration. His entire adult life was dedicated to the struggle for freedom, justice and equality. In him we see what we seek in ourselves," said President Zuma. "As South Africans we are truly proud to have produced this remarkable international statesman.Â  South Africa will join the world tomorrow to celebrate Mandela Day in his honour. "Madiba directed us, all of us to do something good on this day. And contribute to making the world a better place for all of us." President Zuma said it was high time the country tackled issues around land and the economy. "Should we remain landless forever? Should we remain in an economy that is dominated by a few? Those are the tasks that face us today. "And if we talk about that you are turned almost to an abnormal person because we are told you shouldn't say so. If you say that you are messing up things," said President Zuma. eNCA

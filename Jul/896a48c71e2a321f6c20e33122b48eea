"Seventy percent of the world's cocoa comes from the African continent but less than 1% of the world's chocolate is made on the African continent."The father of three may have hung up his engineering hard hat, but that experience has helped him in other ways."Not having the money that is necessary to buy this equipment, I ended up going around scrap heaps and looking for old washing machine drums, ovens and vacuum cleaners and various other things," he says. "Like for example you say earlier, we've got our conche machine that still running to this day and that was built out of recycled washing machine drums and old 50 litre Hart pots where we got granite stone cut to do the actual grinding etc. Being one of Africa's first bean-to-bar chocolate makers, De Villiers is very passionate about the process, and how it s helping everyone involved.I have the sweetest job in the world --------#WorldChocolateDay #localchocolatiers #proudlySA #enca pic.twitter.com/zioizOdBnl"One of the initiatives that's occurred over the last four years - and it s not just us but other chocolate companies that bought cocoa from this Bundibugyo region has for example - contributed to a community library being built where people could be educated, also educated further in what cocoa means for them and improve their lives"Just full of beans today-- These are original cocoa beans from Uganda----Happy World Chocolate day-- we share all the delight on @eNCA soon. -- pic.twitter.com/XGkXW2kj8BAnd while everyone may be celebrating World Chocolate Day, for De Villliers, every day is a celebration of the sweet stuff.eNCA

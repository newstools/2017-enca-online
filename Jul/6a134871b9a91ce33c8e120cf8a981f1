DURBAN Police in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday arrested two suspects including the alleged leader of a mall robbery gang and recovered a number of expensive items which had reportedly been taken in recent robberies.Police spokesperson, Jay Naicker, said an intelligence-driven operation by various police units had led to the arrest of the suspected leader of one of the gangs responsible for numerous mall robberies in the province. Detectives from the Provincial Mall Robbery Task Team had been tracking the movements of the suspect who remained very elusive and was possibly aware that police were looking for him, Naicker said. Last night, police launched an operation after identifying two residences at AA section and BB section in Umlazi, used as hideouts by these criminals. During the operation, two suspects were arrested, including the leader of a mall robbery gang."It is believed that this gang targeted shops that sold jewellery and wrist watches. Police were able to recover wrist watches and expensive perfumes that were taken in some of the robberies.WATCH: 23 undocumented foreign nationals arrested during raids in Johannesburg"The main suspect is positively linked to at least three mall robberies, whilst the second suspect was found in possession of goods taken during a fourth robbery. The two men, who were both in their early thirties, would appear in court soon. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner, Bheki Langa, welcomed the arrests. The Provincial Mall Robbery Task Team has been working around the clock to trace many of the suspects identified during their investigations," he said."It is only a matter of time before we reel in other suspects involved in various mall robberies. We once again appeal to the community not to buy stolen goods and support these criminal gangs. African News Agency

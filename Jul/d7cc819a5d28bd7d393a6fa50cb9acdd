PRETORIA The North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday declared two sections of the Firearms Control Act of 2000 unconstitutional.The sections required firearm owners to renew their licences every five years.Failure to do so meant an owner was in the illegal possession of a firearm.The court gave Parliament 18 months to amend the Act.Until this was done, it would neither be possible nor necessary to renew firearms licences, meaning all licences that were due in terms of FCA of 2000 remained valid. WATCH: SAPS destroy illegal firearmsThe case was brought to the court by the South African Hunters Association.The Gun Owners of South Africa (GOSA) welcomed the ruling. "This is a significant victory for the entire firearm-owning community in South Africa, and it is strangely apt that it should occur on the 4th of July. This event is a significant step forward in our collective struggle against unworkable, arbitrary, inefficient, and unreasonable regulation," GOSA said in a statement. "Those of you who have handed firearms in to the SAPS because your licences have expired would do well to go and retrieve your lawful property as soon as possible," it said. eNCA

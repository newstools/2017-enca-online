Any attempt to threaten or intimidate the media is an attack on our democracy and is a violation of our Constitution, the commission said. Further, section 15 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, belief and opinion. "As such, threats by BFLF to protest at places of worship of members of the media, is an infringement of this right. The SAHRC called on BLF to respect the media s right to operate without fear or favour, and to immediately stop intimidating and harassing journalists." African News Agency

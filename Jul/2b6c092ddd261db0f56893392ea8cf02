LONDON "Hope" the blue whale takes over from "Dippy" the dinosaur as the centrepiece of the revamped atrium of London's Natural History Museum on Thursday despite a spirited campaign to keep the much-loved attraction.The towering replica skeleton had been in the museum for more than 100 years and news of its impending demise in 2015 sparked an outcry from dinosaur fans who sent the hashtag #savedippy trending on Twitter.Some 14,000 people signed a petition to stop the move. Our countdown to #HintzeHall is nearly over so it s time to unveil Hope the #BlueWhale as the latest member of the global #MuseumWhales pod! pic.twitter.com/1kv0cbxvBc But the museum said the skeleton of the blue whale, the largest animal to have lived on Earth and which has been hunted to near extinction, would better raise awareness of mankind's impact on nature.The 25.2-metre (83-foot) real skeleton suspended from the ceiling "is a powerful reminder of the fragility of life and the responsibility we have towards our planet," museum director Michael Dixon said.The whale was previously in the mammals section but was not fully in view and will now take centre stage in the diving lunge feeding position in Hintze Hall, a cathedral-like space built in the late 19th century.Fans of "Dippy" need not despair as the replica will in any case be preserved for posterity in a bronze cast to be placed outside the museum. #ICYMI: Hope is just one of the #MuseumWhales on display globally.

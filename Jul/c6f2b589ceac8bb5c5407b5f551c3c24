JOHANNESBURG Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi says dismissing links between the burglaries at the Office of the Chief Justice and the Hawks would be a mistake.He said that lawlessness was driving these crimes, including the fires at the offices of two different premiers.READ: Two judicial break-in suspects not charged with burglary We are very very much concerned, and I don t believe to dismiss the links would be a solution. If there are links, we must try to get all those links in order for us to be able to resolve this particular matter. Other people can link this also to the burning and arson at the premier s offices, both in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape. What is this lawlessness that undermines the authority of the state? said Mkongi.The burglary at Hawks offices all they needed those thief's was data information about officers same as with Chief Justice officeTen computers containing the personal information of Hawks officials were stolen from the unit s headquarters in the early hours of Wednesday and the unit says early investigations suggest it's an inside job.If criminals can break into hawks and office of chief justice then it means ordinary citizens are in worse state Preliminary investigations have shown us that there was no sign of forced entry and hence we are of the view that there should be something amiss with this break-in, said Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi.WATCH: Should SA be worried about the burglary at the Office of the Chief Justice? In other words, the Hawks have suspicions that this may have been an inside job. The unit has denied that the break-in shows it is incompetent and unable to protect even itself.eNCA

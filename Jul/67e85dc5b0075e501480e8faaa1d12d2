JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma’s son Edward has lashed out at the Human Rights Commission, calling it a vile dog that is mauling black South Africans. Zuma jnr is accusing the commission of muzzling his right to speak about black pain, but the commission says it is he who is violating the right to freedom of expression. READ: Zuma's son given 5 days to apologise over letter The CEO of the commission, Tseliso Thipanyane, said: ”In terms of our Act it is a criminal offence to insult and defame the human rights commission and its dignity. If that's what Edward Zuma is doing then it’s a clear violation of the Human Rights Act. It's also a violation of the constitution ... If we are doing anything wrong, he has every right to take us to the public protector or to court, but he cannot just insult us”. The commission is investigating the president's son for his open letter to former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and former Tourism Minister, Derek Hanekom. Zuma labelled Hanekom a white Afrikaner askari and called Gordhan a sell-out. The commission says it finds the statements offensive and disturbing, and that they promote racial hatred. It has given Zuma jnr five days to retract his letter. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG Supersport United and Horoya AC played to a goalless draw in their CAF Confederation Cup Group D match played at the Stade 28 Septembre Stadium in Conakry in Guinea on Saturday afternoon.The point on the road would have pleased the injury-plagued Supersport squad, who took to the field with a more defensive look to their playing pattern, with defensive midfielders Dean Furman and Michael Morton anchoring the middle of the park.READ: SuperSport sail into next round of Confed CupWithout several key players including Bradley Grobler and attacking midfielder Teboho Mokoena, plus with regular right back defender Michael Boxhall with the New Zealand national team on FIFA Confederation Cup duty, Supersport did well to see off the challenge from the more physical Horoya line up.In a match which produced few quality shots on goal, Ronwen Williams had a quiet match despite his defence being made to work hard, with Ocansey Mandela proving to be a thorn in his opponent s flesh with his powerful and speedy running.FT Score: @horoyaac 0-0 @SuperSportFC #CAFCCChaos nearly erupted in the 80th minute when Mandela seemed to take a dive in the penalty area and the referee initially pointed to the penalty spot for a penalty kick to the home side, before changing his decision to a free kick to Supersport.The match became scrappy after that, with Morton forced to receive medical attention after being covered in blood after an off-the-ball incident.Not even the introduction of New Zealander Jeremy Brockie, who has scored seven goals in the CAF Confederation Cup competition to date, could unlock the Horoya defence, and Supersport seemed pretty pleased to leave Conakry with a well-deserved point.Supersport moved to seven points from five games and will fancy full points when they play their last group match, against Gabonese side CF Mounana on Saturday, while Horoya, with nine points from five games, will look to finish top of the table when they travel to take on TP Mazembe on July 8. The top two sides in the four team group, will qualify for the semi-finalsAfrican News Agency

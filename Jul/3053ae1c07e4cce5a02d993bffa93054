They will vote on the basis of the position of the ANC that it cannot remove itself from authority from government," says Mbete. Mbete also stated that she believes South Africa is ready for a female President. Earlier, ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize called on ANC MPs not to support a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma, saying a vote of no-confidence in the President would weaken the party. The debate on the vote of no confidence in President Zuma is scheduled to take place on 8 August. However, no ruling has been made yet on whether this vote is to take place via a secret ballot - political parties represented in Parliament have been given until 14 July to submit their views on the proposed secret ballot.ANC MP, Dr Makhosi Khoza has criticised NEC Member Fikile Mbalula's threat to MPs that they will be "disciplined" if they vote against the President."The statements that are made by honourable Mbalula that people who are voting for the motion are like suicide bombers," said Khoza."To me that sounds like a bizarre statement. If upholding the Constitution is synonymous with being a suicide bomber, that statement to me is actually frightening." eNCA

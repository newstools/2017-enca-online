JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in Gauteng is pushing for prostitution to be decriminalised. While briefing the media on outcomes of the ANC policy conference, national executive committee (NEC) member, Lindiwe Sisulu said the motion was tabled without notice and would have to be considered at the party's December conference. The Gauteng ANC proposed that paying for sex be criminalised, rather than prostitution itself, where sex workers face the legal consequences. Justice Minister Michael Masutha recently released a long-awaited report by the South African Law Reform Commission for public comment. Two policy proposals are currently on the table regarding adult prostitution keeping the practice totally criminalised or partially criminalising the world s oldest profession.

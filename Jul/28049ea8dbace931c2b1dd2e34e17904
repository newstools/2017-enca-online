JOHANNESBURG - Doctor Vejay Ramlakan, author of the controversial book Mandela's Last Years, could face charges from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and the Health Professions Council (HPC).Retired Constitutional Court Justice Dikgang Moseneke, who is also one of the executors of Madiba's estate, says Ramlakan's book describing Mandela's final years is both legally and ethically unacceptable.The publisher announced yesterday that it has withdrawn the book from circulation out of respect for Mandela's family.READ - Defence department distances itself from new Mandela bookHowever, the executor's of Mandela's estate say more action needs to be taken. "(The ) obvious thing to do is to have this matter reported....to the Medical Professional Council who must inquire into the conduct of Mr Ramlakan... remember when he looked after our deceased president he was acting as a member of the SANDF and he wasn't just a private doctor, he was an employee and should be held to account by the SANDF... and that is precisely what we will be doing as executors... hold to account for disclosures of details of Mandela state of health and the treatment administered in those circumstances ...all of those details are plainly are matters of confidentiality between a doctor and patient ... and true of Mandela and Ramluckan," says Moseneke.

Machel threatened legal action when the book was published, and the executors say they will seek urgent advise on what legal recourse is open to her. eNCA

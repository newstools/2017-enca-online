JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema says his party will go to court if National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete does not allow a secret vote on the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. The vote is to take place on 8 August. Malema says that, having spoken to no fewer than 60 MPs, he is confident that Zuma will be ousted if the ballot is secret.

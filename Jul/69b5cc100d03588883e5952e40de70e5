Ace Magashule, the Free State premier, grabbed attention when he wanted to know why his son was being singled out for working for the controversial Gupta family. 3. The Speaker of Parliament's announcement in the middle of the NPC that the debate on the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma is to take place on 8 August caused a storm.READ: #SecretBallot: SA politicians react to Secret Ballot ruling on TwitterThe Speaker, Baeka Mbete, is yet to rule on whether the vote will take place via a secret ballot, and political parties represented in Parliament have until 14 July to submit their input on the matter to her office.

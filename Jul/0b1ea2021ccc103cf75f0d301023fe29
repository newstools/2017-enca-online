JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) member, Lindiwe Sisulu says social transformation is as important as economic transformation.The party was reporting back on its social transformation policy discussion document on the last day of the ANC National Policy Conference (NPC). "Ours is a social transformation issue - it's not as vibrant as the other commissions because we are all in agreement about what should be done to transform our society," said Sisulu."What we wanted to put across early in the session is that when we talk about social transformation it's almost like its secondary to economic transformation when in fact it is a first-generation right. It's the underbelly of our freedom charter and its also part of what we are wanting to drive to ensure that we change from what we found in this country to the country we want to have."We would like at all times that our people understand that it's radical socio-economic transformation that we agreed to at the 53rd congress of the ANC."Sisulu also says legislation against hate crime must be prioritised. eNCA

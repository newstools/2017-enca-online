NEW YORK - Paul McCartney reached a confidential settlement of his lawsuit against Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, to reclaim copyrights to songs by the Beatles.The accord disclosed on Thursday in filings with the US District Court in Manhattan ended the 75-year-old McCartney's pre-emptive effort to ensure that the copyrights, once owned by Michael Jackson, would go to him starting in October 2018.US District Judge Edgardo Ramos signed an order dismissing the case, but agreed to revisit it if a dispute arose.The dismissal request had been made by Michael Jacobs, a lawyer for McCartney, on behalf of the singer and Sony/ATV.It was unclear how the accord affected McCartney's copyright claims. The singer's representatives could not immediately be reached on Friday for comment.READ: Lennon's Beatles Sgt.

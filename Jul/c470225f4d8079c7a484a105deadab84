KHARTOUM - Sudan insisted on Saturday that it respected media and religious freedoms after the United States said it was "very concerned" about Khartoum's human rights record.Washington raised its concerns just two weeks before President Donald Trump was due to decide whether to permanently lift a 20-year-old US trade embargo on Khartoum."The United States remains very concerned about Sudan's human rights record, including the continued closing of political space, and restrictions on religious freedom, freedom of expression, including press freedom," the US embassy said in a statement on Thursday."Sudan enjoys freedom of press with more than 30 newspapers supporting government as well as opposition views published daily," the foreign ministry said in a statement."Sudan also enjoys religious freedom, which is exemplified with several churches existing adjacent to mosques."READ: US 'concerned' over Sudan human rights record: embassyThe ministry said the fact that Sudan hosted hundreds of thousands of refugees showed there was "no religious discrimination" in the country.The UN refugee agency UNHCR said about 400,000 South Sudanese refugees, most of them Christian, had taken refuge in Sudan since a brutal civil war erupted in their country in late 2013."The government of Sudan is further ready for positive engagement over human rights issues which are internal and sovereign," the ministry said.Some think tanks had urged the Trump administration to delay permanently lifting the trade embargo, accusing Khartoum of widespread human rights violations.Sudan regularly ranked near the bottom of international press freedom rankings.READ: US envoy assesses Darfur ahead of UN force drawdownSudan's National Intelligence and Security Service often confiscated the entire print runs of newspapers without giving any reason.Washington imposed sanctions on Khartoum in 1997 for its alleged support for Islamist militant groups. Now-slain Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was based in Khartoum from 1992 to 1996.Although Washington believed Khartoum's terror ties had ebbed, it kept sanctions in place because of the scorched-earth tactics Sudan used against ethnic minority rebels in Darfur.The United Nations said at least 300,000 people had been killed and 2.5 million displaced in the western region since the conflict erupted in 2003.

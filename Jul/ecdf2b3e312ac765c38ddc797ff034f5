PRETORIA - AgriSA said hydraulic fracturing for shale gas or fracking should not be considered in South Africa given uncertainties around water supply and contamination.The agricultural industry association said fracking would have far-reaching consequences for food security and the country's farming communities.Government was contemplating fracking in areas across the country particularly in the Karoo Basin.The issue was a controversial one because concerns about environmental damage were being weighed up against potential economic benefits.Fracking was the process of injecting liquid at high pressure into subterranean rocks or boreholes so as to force open existing crevices and extract oil or gas.READ: SA lacks infrastructure, technology for effective fracking"In terms of the volumes of water between 10-25 million litres of water is required per fracking event. Fracking can take place more than once per well," said water researcher, Gregory Smith."Contamination can take place via surface spillage or ground water resources. In terms of the flowback, the amount of flowback produced can be between zero percent and 120 percent if they reach pockets of groundwater underground." The concern was over the impact fracking would have on the agricultural sector and on communities living nearby.Experts said not enough research had been done to know exactly how much water was needed and how the available water would be properly managed.READ: Karoo shale would create fewer jobs than farming or tourismDespite the concerns, government had said fracking would be part of the country s energy mix within the next 10 to 15 years."A lot needs to take place from a regulatory perspective, impact studies, social assessments, infrastructure constrains, planning," said AgriSA's Janse Rabie."Government seems to be onboard with shale gas being part of the energy mix. It s part of the draft energy mix plan, as well as energy resource plan. Should the industry prove to be viable government will be a partner with the petrochemical companies."The moratorium on permitting new shale gas exploration permits remained in place, and permits approved for previous applicants Shell, Bundu and Falcon did not allow for hydraulic fracking, only for seismic and exploratory drilling. eNCA

LONDON Toby Roland-Jones saw his dream debut continue as he completed a five-wicket haul to end South Africa's belated resistance and ensure England maintained their domination of the third test at The Oval on Saturday.Yet the home side's push for victory to move them 2-1 ahead in the four-test series was again threatened by the south London weather as rain in the afternoon brought a long stoppage with England 74-1 in their second innings at tea, 252 runs ahead.Roland-Jones had spearheaded the dismissal of South Africa for 175 on the third morning of the 100th Oval test to give England a 178-run first innings lead before another newcomer Tom Westley then helped hammer home the advantage. What a debut! 5/57 for @tobyrj21 https://t.co/a0qhO1GEI8 pic.twitter.com/OxRyVZskeY The Essex new boy Westley, just as in his first innings 25, looked perfectly at home on 28 not out as he and the under-pressure Keaton Jennings, who rode his luck to reach 34, both fought impressively to secure their England futures.Earlier, Temba Bavuma's fine half-century had led a spirited rearguard action from the South African tail but Roland-Jones eventually dismissed him for 52 to finish off the innings and boast remarkable debut figures of 5-57 off 16.4 overs.LIVE UPDATES: SA v ENG 3rd Test Day 3Roland-Jones, the 29-year-old Middlesex seamer who had ripped through the Proteas' top four on Friday in his first 33 balls, became the first England bowler since Graham Onions against West Indies at Lord's in 2009 to take a five-wicket haul in a test debut first innings.Little Bavuma, who came in with the South Africans in disarray at 47-4 on Friday, demonstrated considerable calmness and real spirit to ensure they made a decent recovery from their worst plight when 61-7 on Friday evening. FIVE! @tobyrj21 s wraps up the South Africa innings to complete his five-for on debut!

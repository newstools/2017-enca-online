JOHANNESBURG – It is well known that Pretoria's black residents have perfected the art of speaking their own language. Twitter users have taken to the social media platform to school those that are not from the city on 'sepitori' using the hashtag #learnpitori. The 'language' is a combination of SeTswana and SePedi, as well as some other South African languages. These residents of the City of Tshwane still prefer to call it Pretoria. These are some of the tweets that caught our eye: English: He is from ZCC

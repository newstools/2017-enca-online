JOHANNESBURG – ANC MP Makhosi Khoza has called for President Jacob Zuma's resignation. She made the call at a gathering of more than a 130 civil society organisations. Khoza has come out in favour of a secret ballot in the vote of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. WATCH: Civil society unites against state capture “I am here to defend the ANC commission and not a dishonourable and disgraceful leader. As an African feminist, I find the patriarchal system oppressive. I find being led by a man who harasses women extremely intolerable. He [Zuma] promised to stay for one term, he never did, to know that it is not my pain but the pain of all South Africans. This is a president who promotes tribalism,” she said. “This is a president, when Black intellectuals express their views he calls them clever Blacks. I am Black, I am clever, I am smart, I am educated and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. This is a president who has made us feel awkward for being Black and smart. You are haunting the South African Nation please Mr President step down,” Khoza added. eNCA

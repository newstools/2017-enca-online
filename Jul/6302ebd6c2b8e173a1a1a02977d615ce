PRETORIA - One suspect was shot dead after law enforcement officials foiled an armed robbery at the OR Tambo International Airport's cargo terminal on Saturday morning. In a statement, police said a group of approximately eight suspects, some of whom were wearing security company reflector jackets, entered the cargo terminal in two cars. Some suspects took control of the main gate, while the others proceeded to a Swiss-port warehouse and stole a truck carrying cellphones. The group scattered when police, metro police and security were alerted. Two suspects fled on foot across the R21 highway. One of them was killed in a shoot-out with a Gauteng K9 member while the second was arrested. Another section of the group fled in the hijacked truck, which was later abandoned on the R24 before the suspects fled on foot.

The abandoned vehicle was later recovered in Alexandra. Police said they would continue discussions with the management of the warehouse security about the easy access to security clothing and equipment. "The easy accessibility, or the lack of protection thereof is exacerbating the efforts by police to prevent these robberies from taking place," said police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo. "Inside involvement in this robbery cannot be ruled out at this stage." The case was being investigated by the recently established multi-disciplinary team comprising specialised investigators, Crime Intelligence and forensic experts. "Both the dead suspect, as well as the arrested suspect and the recovered firearms will be profiled to determine if they were involved in other similar crimes," said Naidoo. This robbery came after a brazen heist at OR Tambo Airport in March. eNCA

P KIN, China - China was preparing to launch a powerful rocket on Sunday as the country pressed on with its ambitious space program.Designed to lift space station components, deep-space probes and communication satellites into orbit, the Long March-5 Y2 was Beijing's second heavy-lift rocket able to carry up to 25 tonnes - or around the same weight as 16 cars.It would take off from the Wenchang launch center in the tropical island province of Hainan, carrying the new Shijian-18 experimental communications satellite, state broadcaster CGTN reported on Saturday.It said the satellite would operate on geosynchronous orbit and provide communications services over China's territory - boosting internet access and providing access to more television channels.The process of filling propellant into fuel tanks began Saturday afternoon, CGTN said.READ: Successful SpaceX launch delivers satellites into orbitXinhua state news agency reported last week that the Long March-5 Y2 would be fuelled by liquid hydrogen, kerosene and liquid oxygen.Beijing viewed its multi-billion-dollar space programme as a symbol of its rise and of the Communist Party's success in turning around the fortunes of the once poverty-stricken nation.Last month, it successfully launched the Long March-4B, its first X-ray space telescope to study black holes, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts.And in April, the country's first cargo spacecraft completed its docking with an orbiting space lab - a key development toward China's goal of having its own crewed space station by 2022.AFP

JOHANNESBURG- Spur's acquisition of RocoMamas is proving profitable.RocoMamas' sales growth was boosted by the opening of new restaurants as the brand expanded its footprint to 50 outlets.This is despite middle-class customers reducing their spending on takeaways as a result of the slow economy.Spur said this had made the trading environment difficult.Higher income consumers remained resilient, though, as reflected in the robust performance of the group's Hussar Grill.Spur plans to expand its business internationally, opening outlets in New Zealand, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia.The company is due to release its full financial results in September. eNCA

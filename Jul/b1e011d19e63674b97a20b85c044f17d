Officials of the ANC have gone to Harry Gwala [region] to meet with all councillors and all branches of Harry Gwala and try to calm the situation and try to understand what is happening as well and I believe that all members of the ANC also work linked with the police so that we get to know what is happening, Zikalala said.READ: Let's differ with leaders in proper platforms: ANC KZN chair ZikalalaMagaqa is tipped to become the ANC s regional secretary and political analyst Lukhona Mnguni believes this proves there is a serious battle for power within the ANC. There is an upcoming regional elective congress and that means there is a power contestation, said Mnguni. It's not only a local power contestation but also it's probably a power contestation even on the question around who should lead the ANC nationally. Mnguni is concerned that these incidents will become more common ahead of the ANC's national elective conference in December.eNCA

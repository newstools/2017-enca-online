JOHANNESBURG - Paseka Motsoeneng, popularly known as Pastor Mboro, has explained why he is suing the cultural and religious rights commission. The commission -- whose full name is the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities  -- released a report on Tuesday asking churches to reveal their annual finances. For some time now the commission has been concerned about donations to churches, including Mboro's the Incredible Happenings Ministry. READ: Mboro says will shut down church if members don’t pay legal costs However, Mboro says his church is not accountable to the commission. “(The) commission is not a commission for the people. It has its own mission to divide the church [and] destroy the body of Christ,” Mboro said in an interview on eNCA. “There are many religions in this country with so many wrongs. They bring this grass issues and snakes while sangomas are doing that, selling snake skins and feeding people muti." When queried about who would pay his legal fees, Pastor Mboro issued a veiled threat to his congregants that if they have not come forward to pay for his legal fees in the next nine weeks, he would pay the fees, but he would go on strike and refuse to pray for them. "I pray for them when they’re sick. I’m in all this mess because of them. There’s a child - I said I’m not going to pray for people anymore – who had a rotten operation, it wouldn’t heal for three weeks. I said I’m not gonna do it, but Gods power that’s in me touched that girl; god though me ,through this blessed water spray and the name of Jesus, they (the child's wounds) are sealed and there is medical proof of that and the pictures. "All those people who need services from me, after this nine weeks, if they don’t pay for it, I will pay for it. I’m going on strike."

It was lifted the following year.Lungu said the fire, which destroyed the southern part of City Market in the capital, Lusaka, on Tuesday, "bordered on economic sabotage" and was aimed at making the country ungovernable.Nobody was killed or injured in the blaze."I have issued a statutory instrument proclaiming that a situation exists in this country which if allowed to continue may lead to a state of public emergency. This proclamation will be tabled in the national assembly," Lungu said in a televised address."There is no doubt in my mind that the intention of these perpetrators is to make the country ungovernable and as president of this country it is my responsibility to respond to forestall chaos."READ: Maimane prevented from entering ZambiaPolice have said some people were planning to vandalise vital installations, including bridges and power stations, after the blaze.They said one person had been taken into custody for trying to torch a bus station and they were seeking those who vandalised electricity transmission lines to a suburb near the capital last month.Hichilema, leader of the United Party for National Development, was arrested in April when police raided his home and charged him with trying to overthrow the government.An economist and businessman widely known by his initials "HH", Hichilema was defeated in August last year by Lungu in an election that the opposition politician denounced as fraudulent. His attempts to mount a legal challenge have been unsuccessful.Reuters

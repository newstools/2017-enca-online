JOHANNESBURG Minister of State Security David Mahlobo s statement that he knew about impending violence in Vuwani a year before it happened hasn t gone unnoticed on social media.Journalists covering the ANC National Policy Conference media briefing on peace and stability laughed in shock when Mahlobo admitted that he and his intelligence services were aware that there would be violent protests in the Limpopo town. Vuwani became a bedrock of protests after the area was incorporated into the Malamulele municipality by the demarcation board.Strangely, law enforcement services failed to prevent the violent carnage during which schools and other public property was destroyed by angry residents.More than 20 schools were either torched or damaged, bringing classes to a standstill.Twitter users found it amusing that Mahlobo failed to prevent and manage the protests before they escalated. #Mahlobo trying to do the damage control on #vuwani slip up pic.twitter.com/b110rmTLVv #Mahlobo reaction after his #Vuwani slip pic.twitter.com/FlSI9LZ06W But Mahlobo really doesn't respect us. So basically he just let schools burn in Vuwani. No pro-active action. He is lying, he didn't know. #countryDuty #ANCNCP Mahlobo says they knew about Vuwani & Malamulele last year. Why wasn't it prevented? pic.twitter.com/x2jdgg5F2d According to Incompetent David Mahlobo, State Security knew a year prior that Vuwani unrest and burning of schools would happen. #ANCNPC pic.twitter.com/NrYbHyLUNq Meanwhile #Mahlobo via #Vuwani situation: Baba, can we talk?

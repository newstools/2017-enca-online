Chug! Chug!" as the crowd cheered -- so the 50-year-old Oscar winner stood up and finished off her drink in one go."'Kingsman' and Fox films would like to remind you to drink responsibly, not like Halle Berry. She's a professional, she can handle it," quipped Ross, a British TV host and the husband of "Kingsman" screenwriter Jane Goldman.While Berry spent much of the panel with her head in her hands, thousands of fans in the San Diego Convention Center were treated to exclusive footage from the $140 million movie, which opens on September 22.READ: Adam West, star of hit TV series 'Batman', dies at 88One high-octane sequence saw Egerton's character Eggsy speeding in a taxi cab through London before careening into a lake, while in another he is beaten up by Tatum, who still has the physique he sculpted for the "Magic Mike" films.While he has clearly bulked up for his own role, Egerton admitted that he was "nothing in terms of strength" compared with his co-star."All I will say is don't get into a fight with Channing Tatum," he added.

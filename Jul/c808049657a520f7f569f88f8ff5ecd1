But the White House kept the nuclear deal alive, continuing to waive the relevant sanctions every few months as required under the agreement.It was in the midst of a 90-day review on whether to stick with the nuclear deal, although any move to abandon it would be strongly opposed by the other signatories Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia.Return to IranMonday's signing would mark Total's return to Iran, which had the second-largest gas reserves and fourth-largest oil reserves in the world."We're the first Western major to return to Iran. We're very happy," Pouyanne told AFP when the initial deal was signed in November. Iran's oil officials were keen to attract Western investment and know-how to improve the outdated energy infrastructure.Preliminary agreements were also signed in December with Shell and Russia's Gazprom to develop oil and gas projects. Such deals had not been without controversy in Iran, where the memory of exploitation by foreign firms in the early 20th century remained a highly sensitive topic.French energy giant 'Total' to sign $4.8 bn gas deal with Iran: Oil ministry - https://t.co/4bHXYDj8LC https://t.co/D1NeHPU9kZConservatives criticised the move to award tenders to foreign firms last year, forcing the oil ministry to state that domestic conglomerates, including one controlled by the elite Revolutionary Guards, would be allowed to compete.The site would eventually pump 50.9 million m of gas per day into Iran's national grid.AFP

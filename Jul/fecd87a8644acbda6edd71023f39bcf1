YOTSUKAIDO, Japan - A 67-year-old former policeman became the envy of little girls everywhere as the owner of the world's biggest Hello Kitty collection - a quarter of a million dollars' (R3.2-million) worth of moon-faced memorabilia.Masao Gunji, who spent his working life on the trail of hardened criminals, now spent his retirement tracking down pink and white soft toys to keep in a Hello Kitty-themed house, which he built specially and which had become a magnet for tourists."Kitty has been like the love of my life," he said at his one-storey property, which was surrounded by regular houses."I love Kitty," he added, calling her "adorable, especially her facial expressions."Hello Kitty, Japan's global icon of cute, was introduced in 1974 and was now one of the country's most famous exports - adorning everything from pencil cases to pyjamas.To the surprise of fans, brand owner Sanrio said in 2014 the feline-inspired character was not actually a cat but a "happy little girl", sparking uproar from internet users who spluttered: "But she's got whiskers!"READ: LGBT art through the agesThough he did not live on the property, Gunji was recognised last November by Guinness World Records for his collection, having spent around 30 million yen (R3.4-million) on thousands of items, including the house.More than 5,000 items he owned bear Kitty's iconic red bow, propelling Gunji past the previous record holder, who was also Japanese.Gunji's wife Yoshiko said she fully supported her husband's passion."I don t care how much he spends on Hello Kitty," she said."People need to make a mark on the world, and Hello Kitty is the one he lives for," she added."This is his dream."AFP

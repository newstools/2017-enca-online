She chatted to eNCA's Weekend Wakeup host Ayanda-Allie Paine on Sunday morning, giving her views on the challenges for the channel, the intensity of the political landscape and the principles that guide her decision making.Mhlangu indicated that until last week she would have considered her priority to be "to arm journalists with skills to decipher information because there is so much information out there. We need to boost our research capabilities because we expect (journalists) to be scientists today, we expect them to be economists tomorrow."However, the incidents of intimidation that occurred last week outside the home of Tiso Blackstar Editor at Large, Peter Bruce, had forced her to reprioritise.READ: Communications Minister condemns BLF's attacks on journalistsMhlangu said that when she reported at the height of political violence in the Midlands, "Companies were sending us to conflict reporting courses. We were told that you must always go in packs, you mustn t go to an area alone."But she pointed out that the situation now was different. "How do you protect journalists from people who come intimidate them at home?", she asked.Mhlangu said that journalists who covered dramatic stories were encouraged to go for counselling, but what happens if "someone is following them."How are we going to encourage young journalists with young families that this profession is still worth it?" she asked.She said media owners need to consider how to "protect journalists in an era when the enemy is unknown... (and) can use information to intimidate you."News editors need to "make sure that we create a safe environment for our young reporters to continue to report without fear or favour and to stay in this profession, because more than ever now its s become very important to tell the truth, to separate rhetoric from facts," she said.Mhlangu warned that the intimidation of Peter Bruce "was meant to send a chilling effect to the entire profession, and I wonder if they have succeeded. But I think now that s a big job for all of us news editors, to try and make sure that we reaffirm our reporters, and we tell them that you go and continue to ask those difficult questions because it is worth it." *View the attached video where eNCA's new Editor-In-Chief expounds more fully on her views.eNCA

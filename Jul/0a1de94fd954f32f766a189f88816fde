JOHANNESBURG -Â A group of former pupils is calling on the principal of St. John's College in Johannesburg to resign.
	
	A group calling itself Open Saint Johns is gunning for Principal Paul Edey and the Chairperson of the school council. They say the pair failed to lead during a racism row that engulfed the school this week. READ: St John's teacher leaves school with immediate effect This culminated in the firing of a racist teacher on Friday. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi ordered the school to reverse its decision to allow geography teacher Keith Arlow to continue with his duties. An independent hearing found that Arlow victimised pupils based on their race. He was given a final written warning and a pay cut, but Lesufi overruled this. eNCA

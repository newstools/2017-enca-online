JOHANNESBURG - Poor students won't have to pay for tertiary education from next year. That's what the ANC is promising after it's weekend legotla. ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe said the party wants government to convert student loans into grants from next year. Mantashe said only students from poor families should benefit from the scheme. He also said that growing youth unemployment topped the agenda. "An issue that came out quite sharply is the growing number of unemployed graduates as well as measures to protect local labours and jobs," he said. eNCA

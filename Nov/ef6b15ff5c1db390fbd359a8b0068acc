CAPE TOWN - Triple murder-accused Henri van Breda spent the weekend at Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic, a private hospital in Cape Town, where he was diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after a series of medical tests. On Monday, defence lawyer Piet Botha told the Western Cape High Court that his 23-year-old client had a seizure on Wednesday last week and was hospitalised on Thursday and was seen by neurologist Dr James Butler. The defence was due to call a psychologist on Monday, but proceedings were postponed to give her time to amend her report if she deemed it necessary, as she has not yet had sight of the neurologist’s report. Judge Siraj Desai said ethical issues may arise, however, as the neurologist -- Dr Butler -- had been a potential state witness whom they ultimately did not call, but had consulted. WATCH: Van Breda murder trial postponed Judge Desai will have to decide, after listening to arguments from both sides, whether he can be called. Botha urged the court to call him if the defence’s request is turned down, as the doctor’s testimony is “relevant to the 2 hours 40 minutes”, a time lapse that has been highlighted in the trial. Van Breda has pleaded not guilty to murdering his father, Martin, brother Rudi and mother Teresa. His sister Marli, who was 16 at the time of the January 2015 attacks, survived but suffered severe head injuries and has retrograde amnesia. The psychologist who will take the stand on Tuesday is expected to explain his inaction to the court. Senior state prosecutor Susan Galloway said she did not object to the psychologist’s testimony, but would argue what weight should be attached to it. Court proceedings will resume on Tuesday.

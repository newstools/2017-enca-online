JOHANNESBURG - Four houses burnt down and roads were closed to traffic on Tuesday afternoon as a fire raged on the mountain slopes of Sir Lowry's Pass and Gordon's Bay. Some 200 firefighters using 33 fire vehicles were fighting the fire, which was burning along the N2 all the way from Gordon's Bay to the Steenbras River Mouth, Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Theo Layne said. Layne said the fire was posing a serious smoke hazard. Both Sir Lowry's Pass and the Sir Lowry's Pass Roads were expected to remain closed for the rest of Tuesday. It was not expected that the fire would be contained before Wednesday, at the earliest, he said. Layne said gale-force southeasterly wind was fuelling the blaze and making it impossible to fight it from the air. Farm animals had been evacuated from the area by animal welfare organisations. eNCA

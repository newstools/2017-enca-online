JOHANNESBURG – Justice lobby group Oxfam has warned that governments need to put in place measures to curb the movement of money into tax havens. The group says there doesn’t seem to be sufficient political will to deal with tax avoidance. The so-called paradise paper leaks contain 13, 4 million documents, mainly from elite law firm Appleby, which help clients set up companies or trusts in countries with low or zero tax rates. Standard Bank, the Shanduka Group, and Glencore are mentioned in the papers. So are well-known people like Queen Elizabeth and Formula One race driver Lewis Hamilton among others.

The group says governments need to put in place five measures to stop tax avoidance. It has since listed the measures as follows.  "The global international community has a responsibility in reforming the international tax system to put an end to those loopholes. Legal or illegal we need to put solutions in the interest of developing countries," said Ruiz.

JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's axed vice president Emmerson Mnagagwa is expected back in that country soon to resume talks with President Robert Mugabe, the head of the country's military Constantino Chiwenga said on Monday night. During a short media briefing, Chiwenga said he was encouraged by the contact between Mnagagwa, whom the army wants to succeed Mugabe, and the president. Chiwenga said he has had further consultations with Mugabe to agree on a roadmap forward, after the president failed to resign as expected during a national address on Sunday.

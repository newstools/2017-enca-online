LONDON - South Africa’s Kwagga Smith and Adriaan Strauss have cracked run-on berths in the Barbarians teams to play the All Blacks on Saturday at Twickenham in London. There is a strong SA presence on the bench that includes Akker van der Merwe, Ruan Smith (Brumbies), Willie Britz, Ruan Ackermann and Robert du Preez. READ: All Blacks to face Springboks in World Cup opener Normally jam-packed with Northern Hemisphere talent, the Barbarians are stacked with 13 New Zealand players. Ten of the Kiwi players are in the starting lineup with the headline act undoubtedly being Julian Savea on the right wing. With 46 Test tries to his credit from 54 Tests, Savea will be eager to make a statement against the All Blacks and get one over his younger brother Ardie.  The clash between pivots Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo’unga will also be fascinating while Luke Whitelock and Jerome Kaino are sure to wage a big battle at the back of the scrum. The Barbarians will be inspired by their last clash against the All Blacks in 2009. On that day the Barbarians stunned the All Blacks to win 25-18 at Twickenham. Springboks flyer Bryan Habana was the hero with three tries for the Barbarians while Ben Smith and Anthony Boric crossed for the All Blacks. It remains the All Blacks only loss to the Barbarians in their 10-match history stretching back to 1954.

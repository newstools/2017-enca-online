JOHANNESBURG - Unmissable 28-year-old lawyer and activist Thando Hopa recently made headlines for having received an invite to be a part of the prestigious Pirelli calendar for 2018. Hopa spoke about juggling a busy prosecuting career and utilising the modeling platform to advocate for underrepresented people, especially those living with albinism. Although on a sabbatical, she planned  to give herself more time to explore modeling and to carve a way through the industry, while still leaving herself time to practice her activism. Last year, Pirelli received accolades after shifting the focus of their calendar towards a more feminist-friendly perspective. The modest but passionate Hopa gave eNCA.com an inside look into the three-day long photoshoot with photographer Tim Walker.  eNCA

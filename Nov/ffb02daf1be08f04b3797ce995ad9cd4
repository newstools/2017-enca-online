JOHANNESBURG - eNCA's OG Molefe was named Sports Journalist of the Year at the 2017 South African Sports Awards held in Kempton Park on Gauteng’s East Rand on Sunday. Molefe, who is sports editor at eNCA, said it was a huge honour to scoop the award and says the journey to get the accolade has been truly amazing. “I dedicate the award to all the great journalists who were my mentors when I first started out with no knowledge of how to even cover a sports story. They have since become my brothers.” “My story is testament to the fact that anything is possible in life if you put your heart and mind into it and just work hard,” Molefe said. “I am also grateful for the opportunity given to me to me by e.TV a decade ago, even though I had zero television experience.” Long jumper Luvo Manyonga was named Sportsman of the Year with 800m women’s Olympic gold medallist and IAAF World Champ Caster Semenya bagging two awards. Semenya picked up the Sportswoman of the Year and People’s Choice Sports Star of the Year. eNCA

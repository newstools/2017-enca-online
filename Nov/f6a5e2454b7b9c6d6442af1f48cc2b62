JOHANNESBURG – South Africans were pulling out umbrellas, jerseys and blankets on Wednesday, as cold and wet weather swept across various parts of the country.  In KwaZulu-Natal, a warning was issued for flooding due to heavy rains. There is also a possibility of gale force winds.  MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube urged residents in the province to be extra cautious. “Disaster Management teams in the province are ready to deal with any incidences that may occur as a result of bad weather. We have activated all disaster centres across all districts for teams to be on standby to assist and work together with law enforcement agencies to ensure that human lives are protected. The heavy rains that our province experiences cause a lot of damage to vital public infrastructure like roads and bridges,” said Dube-Ncube. KZN was lashed by severe storms in October and earlier in November. The drought-stricken Western Cape received some much-needed rain.  At the same time, snow was observed over the Matroosberg mountains near Ceres.  Residents in Gauteng, the Free State and Mpumalanga can expect a sharp drop in temperatures from Thursday.  Johannesburg is expected to drop to a minimum of 5°C reaching a high of 19°C while Pretoria will drop to 7°C, reaching a maximum of 22°C. The weather is expected to clear up over the weekend. - Additional reporting by African News Agency eNCA

JOHANNESBURG –Most Zimbabweans have made South Africa their home but some are returning to celebrate the resignation of former President Robert Mugabe. South African Airways (SAA) said it was monitoring the situation to ensure that there are enough flights to meet the demand. The airline, however, said it had not experienced any disruptions since the developments in Zimbabwe. The 93-year-old resigned on Tuesday as state president following his removal as Zanu PF leader. He led the nation for 37-years.

At the moment, we operate three flights per day from Johannesburg to Harare vice versa. This is one of the highest daily frequencies in the SADC region,” he said.

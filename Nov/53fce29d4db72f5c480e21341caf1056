VIENNA - World-famous Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky died on Wednesday aged 55 in London following a long illness, according to announcements on his Facebook page and by the Vienna State Opera. "This is a very, very sad day for all of us... With Dmitri Hvorostovsky, we lost an outstanding singer and a real friend," Vienna State Opera director Dominique Meyer said. Hvorostovsky, tall and striking with a shock of silver hair and famous for his interpretations of Italian and Russian repertoire in particular, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2015, but continued to perform.

"After a two-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer, he died peacefully this morning, 22 November, surrounded by family near his home in London, UK. May the warmth of his voice and his spirit always be with us," the message said. Born in Siberia in 1962, Hvorostovsky sang in a heavy metal band before making his opera debut in Verdi's RigolettoÂ in Russia. He burst onto the international scene in 1989 when he won the Cardiff Singer of the World competition and went on to wow audiences in all the world's major opera houses. Meyer said that he remembered his many memorable performances in Vienna, in particular his last one in November 2016 in La Traviata.

"I especially admire the wonderful way in which he carried himself during this terrible illness," he added. The Vienna State Opera has hissed the black flag in mourning and will dedicate Hvorostovsky a minute of silence before Wednesday's performance of "Salome" by Richard Strauss. AFP

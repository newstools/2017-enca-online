READ: Henri van Breda diagnosed with epilepsy The defence was due to call a psychologist on Monday, but proceedings were postponed to give her time to amend her report if she deemed it necessary, as she has not yet had sight of the neurologist’s report. Judge Siraj Desai said ethical issues may arise, however, as the neurologist -- Dr James Butler -- had been a potential State witness whom they ultimately did not call, but had consulted. Van Breda has pleaded not guilty to murdering his father, Martin, brother Rudi and mother Teresa. His sister Marli, who was 16 at the time of the January 2015 attacks, survived but suffered severe head injuries and has retrograde amnesia. He claims that an intruder, armed with an axe and knife, and wearing dark clothing, a balaclava and gloves was behind the attacks. He said, in his plea explanation, that during the pursuit of the attacker he lost his footing and fell down the stairs. African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) and Constitutional Court (Concourt) are fulfilling their mandates and respecting the separation of powers. That’s according to the Department of Justice after it conducted a study into the way the apex courts are affecting socioeconomic transformation. The report notes the two courts keep government on its toes in ensuring it fulfills its constitutional mandates. But the study points out that poor skills and capacity constraints affect the implementation of judgments. Minister Michael Masutha said conflict over the separation of powers is normal in democratic societies. According to Masutha, “The executive may feel that it is being squeezed to a point where it becomes almost impossible for us. And the judiciary may feel there is still room for improvement.” eNCA

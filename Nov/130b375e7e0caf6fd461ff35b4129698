JOHANNESBURG - State prosecutors are adamant that Oscar Pistorius deserves a 15 year murder sentence. The state is arguing that Pistorius's six-year prison sentence is far too lenient and trivialises his crime. They insist he’s shown no real remorse for killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. WATCH: Judgment reserved in Oscar Pistorius appeal Oscar Pistorius's advocate, Barry Roux tried to punch holes in the state's argument that the blade runner hadn't shown remorse.  Roux argues that Judge Tokozile Masipa had considered all factors when handing down the six-year sentence. Masipa had noted that Pistorius was vulnerable, on his stumps, and extremely anxious when he fired his weapon.  Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) Judge, Willie Seriti has defended Judge Thokozile Masipa's handling of the Oscar Pistorius trial in 2009.  Legal Expert, Kelly Phelps denies Pistorius is receiving special treatment because of his disability.  eNCA

LONDON - Uber's secret $100,000 (R1.3-million) pay-off to hackers to cover up a massive breach of customer and driver data at the ride-hailing firm raises "huge concerns" about its data policies and ethics, Britain's data protection regulator said on Wednesday. "Deliberately concealing breaches from regulators and citizens could attract higher fines for companies," James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of the UK Information Commissioner's Office, said in a statement.

Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who replaced co-founder Travis Kalanick as CEO in August, said the company had fired two senior security officials involved in the cover-up. Uber said it was in the process of notifying various regulatory authoriies but declined to comment further. Reuters

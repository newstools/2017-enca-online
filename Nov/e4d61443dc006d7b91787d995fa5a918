The book alleges hundreds of millions of rand disappeared from a slush fund, set up for State Security’s Principal Agent Network (PAN). The President's Keepers: Arthur Fraser's family considering legal action Fraser apparently oversaw the programme between 2007 and 2009. According to John Steenhuisen, DA chief whip, "we believe it’s high time now that those responsible for committing this fraud and corruption are brought to book.

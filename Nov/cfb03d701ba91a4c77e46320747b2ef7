NEW YORK - Late prolific designer Lee Alexander McQueen was responsible for iconic moments in fashion history, especially during the course of his collaboration with designer Shaun Leane. Having worked closely with Givenchy from 1996 to 2001, the late fashion designer is still being remembered for his incredibly eccentric designs. Sotheby's in association with Kerry Taylor Auctions, is excited to offer Couture Fashion Jewellery: The Personal Archive of Shaun Leane on 4 December. Leane, the award winning British designer, decided to have an evening sale that will feature 45 bespoke pieces that he designed during his merger with McQueen. The auction is said to feature some of Leaneâ€™s classic items, including a skeleton corset from SS98 and the crown of thorns from the AW96 'Dante' collection. The items will range from R27,576 to R5 million. eNCA

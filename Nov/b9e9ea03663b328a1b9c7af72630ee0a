PARYS, Free State - Controversy surrounds the Provincial General Council (PGC) meeting of the ANC in the Free State.  Some supporters of presidential hopeful, Cyril Ramaphosa are boycotting the PEC, calling it a sham. Members are supposed to be deciding who the province's preferred candidates will be ahead of the ANC's December elective conference. Ramaphosa campaign coordinator in the region, Monnepule Ntamo, says the PEC that's underway is illegal.

The ANC in the Free State has not reached the 70% threshold for the BGM [branch general meeting]. There is no basis for the province to begin to call the provincial general council. A number of branches that still have disputes. The PGC was called by the current illegal PEC of the FS. The Court has not yet ruled on the matter. Judgement will be handed down between tomorrow and Thursday," said Ntamo.  READ: ANC succession race: Free State ANCYL backs Dlamini-Zuma The deputy secretary general of the ANC, Jessie Duarte, will address the Free State PGC on Tuesday afternoon.  ANC Free State chairman, Ace Magashule's term in office ended earlier this year and disgruntled members are therefore disputing the legitimacy of his leadership in the province.  eNCA

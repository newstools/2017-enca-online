JOHANNESBURG - The ANC has slammed leaders for naming their preferred running mates ahead of the 54th national elective conference in December. It said such pronouncements are unacceptable and seek to usurp the entrenched right of the branches to nominate candidates of their choosing. Speaking at an ANC rally in Limpopo, Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa named his prefered list of people to be part of his executive should he be elected ANC president.

Accordingly, in implementing this resolution, the national executive committee (NEC) had directed officials to ensure that branch nominations were not tampered with and that the will of the branches was reflected and respected. The organisation had therefore "called on all its leaders and members to desist from the practice of pronouncing on and circulating slates, which may be seen to undermine the branches' inalienable right to select candidates best placed to implement the National Democratic Revolution". eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Ten dog fighters appeared at the Lenasia Magistrate’s court on Tuesday, facing dog fighting charges. The men were arrested after ongoing investigations by the National Council of SPCA (NSPCA) Special Investigations Unit and the Provincial Organised Crime Unit. “People who get gratification from dog fighting demonstrate that they have low empathy and would likely be willing to engage in violent behaviour. This is why it is imperative for action to be taken against the violence of dog fighting, not only by the NSPCA, but by other law enforcement authorities as well,” said Senior Inspector Wendy Willson of the NSPCA Special Investigations Unit.

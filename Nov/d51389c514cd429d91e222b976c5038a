PRETORIA - President Jacob Zuma is greatly concerned by the political situation in Zimbabwe. In a statement issued on behalf of regional bloc SADC, Zuma called for "calm and restraint" and "expressed hope that developments in Zimbabwe would not lead to unconstitutional changes of government as that would be contrary to both SADC and African Union positions." South Africa's neighbour was on a knife's edge on Wednesday after the army took over the state broadcaster. The army insisted that President Robert Mugabe was safe and was not a target of its actions.

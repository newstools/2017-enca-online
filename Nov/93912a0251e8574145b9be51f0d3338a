JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's latest credit ratings downgrades will affect job creation, business leaders and economists warned.  On Friday, S&P Global downgraded the rand to junk status. The agency also pushed South Africa’s foreign debt further into sub-investment grade. The agency said the country’s weak economic growth has led to a deterioration in public finances. Meanwhile, Moody’s held both its local and foreign ratings just at the edge of investment grade, with a review for downgrade. On Thursday, Fitch downgraded South Africa's long-term debt to junk status. The ratings table shows South Africa lies well into junk with two of the three major agencies. READ: How will junk status affect South Africans "We saw them highlight that political uncertainty as we go forward towards the ANC political elective conference in December as one of the biggest reasons and structurally the debt burden on state-owned enterprises. The widening of the current account deficit is certainly not sustainable in this and the rating agencies have highlighted as such," said economist Sam Rolland. Economists said those looking for jobs should be worried. Alexander Forbes Chief Economist Lesiba Mothata warned that interest rates could increase as part of a ripple effect, meaning consumers will increasingly struggle to pay their debts. " And also, because you are now struggling to pay this higher interest cost your job is not secure. In fact, work hours get reduced. So your work hours are reduced, you get retrenched, you can't service the debt that you have." Reacting to the latest news, Treasury said it will use its annual budget next year to outline what it called a decisive policy to strengthen its fiscal framework. It said it aims to restore business and consumer confidence while pushing for inclusive growth.

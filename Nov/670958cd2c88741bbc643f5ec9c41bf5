PRETORIA – Gauteng police commissioner Lt-Gen Deliwe de Lange has welcomed the five life sentences handed to convicted serial rapist Charles Mthetwa in the High Court in Pretoria on Friday. De Lange hailed the sentences as an endorsement of a meticulous and thorough investigation by the investigating detectives team, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said. “The sentence comes as the South African Police Service [SAPS] has taken it upon themselves to prioritise investigation of cases against women and children in line with [Police] Minister Fikile Mbalula’s six point action plan on gender-based violence.” READ: WCape police welcome life sentences for Cameron Wilson On Friday, Mthethwa, who had been terrorising the communities of Olifantsfontein, Ivory Park, and Erasmia between 2013 and 2015, was handed five life sentences and 100 years behind bars for crimes including murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, and assault, Peters said. “We are convinced that the diligent work by members of our component specialising in cases related to family violence, child protection, and sexual offences (FCS) will go a long way in making sure that perpetrators of such offenses deservedly face the full might of the law,” De Lange said.

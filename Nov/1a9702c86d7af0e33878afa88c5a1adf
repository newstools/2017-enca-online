JOHANNESBURG - Springbok coach Alister Coetzee has made five changes to the starting line-up for the Wales match in Cardiff on Saturday. Warrick Gelant and Dan du Preez will get their first starts for the Springboks in the final Test of 2017. The inclusion of Gelant is one of five changes to the starting line-up announced by Springbok coach Allister Coetzee on Thursday for the last match of the Castle Lager Outgoing Tour. Gelant replaces Courtnall Skosan on the left wing for his first start. There are four changes amongst the forwards. Steven Kitshoff replaces the experienced Tendai Mtawarira, who is suffering from a groin injury and not available for selection.

Siya Kolisi is back in the side after missing the Italy Test and he comes in for Francois Louw on the side of the scrum, while Du Preez will also earn his first start in the No 8 jersey as replacement for Duane Vermeulen. Louw, Vermeulen and Franco Mostert (lock) are back at their overseas clubs and not available because this match falls outside the World Rugby Test window. Meanwhile, the uncapped duo of Lukhanyo Am (centre) and Louis Schreuder (scrumhalf) will join Mbonambi on the bench as two of a number of changes amongst the replacements, with Uzair Cassiem, Oupa Mohoje and Ruan Dreyer also included in the in the match day squad. Coetzee said the squad has prepared well for the contest against Wales. “We expect another gruelling contest against a strong Welsh team,” said Coetzee. IN MEMES: Boks & Bafana, same WhatsApp group “It is another opportunity for this side to develop and grow, playing at the Principality Stadium in front of a passionate crowd of more than 65,000. It will be a different challenge altogether this week – Wales are renowned for their passing game and their width on attack.” Regarding the shuffles in his team, the Bok coach said: “Dan gets the chance to start and he fits into the plan for Saturday. “Warrick is an elusive runner, he used his opportunity last week and I am looking forward to see him getting a start on Saturday. “It is great to welcome Malcolm back, however, Bongi did a superb job against Italy and I expect the same performance from him when he comes on later in the game.” The battle for lineout possession will again be a key factor on Saturday, and in this regard Coetzee said: “I decided to select two loose forwards onto the bench because Pieter-Steph du Toit can cover lock, while Oupa and Uzair each have a skills set that can fit into different roles when needed.” Eben Etzebeth will captain the Springbok team for the 11th time this season, playing in his 67 international match for South Africa.

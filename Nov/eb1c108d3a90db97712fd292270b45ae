JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows will be desperate to get back on to the winning trail when Absa Premiership action resumes on Tuesday night. The Buccaneers and second-on-the-log Arrows have both suffered reverses in their past two outings (league and Telkom Knockout) and will be on a mission to secure the three maximum points on offer at the Orlando Stadium on Tuesday evening. Log-leaders Baroka FC, with 17 points from 10 games and with a two-point advantage over Arrows, are away to third-placed Cape Town City (15 points from 9 games) with Benni McCarthy’s charges hoping to go top if they can win at home in another Tuesday fixture. Also on Tuesday, league champions but second last on-the-table Bidvest Wits who advanced to the Telkom Knockout final in beating Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend, seem to have turned the corner in terms of form but will have a tricky encounter at home to Mamelodi Sundowns (12 points from 7 games).

JOHANNESBURG - A neurologist says it’s possible that triple murder accused Henri van Breda, could have killed his parents and brother and then suffered an epileptic seizure.
	
	Defence expert, Dr James Butler, says there is compelling evidence that Van Breda had the attack, shortly after his family was axed to death. He says he’s absolutely confident in his diagnosis that Van Breda has juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

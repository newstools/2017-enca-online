METSIMAHOLO, Free State - President Jacob Zuma says the problems plaguing the alliance have to be resolved. He was addressing an alliance partner meeting ahead of the Free State's Metsimaholo Municipality by-election.

According to Zuma, voters sometimes suffer from fatigue but come back to the ANC afterwards. He says it is critical that political leaders discuss this. "I'm giving just the background as to say why I thought we should come and say: comrades, it's too late for us, we failed. We accept the blame. We should have intervened earlier. It's too late. Ok, contest, but comrades, whoever wins here, you don't know our discussion on the other side," said Zuma.  The president called for a discussion in the ANC on how the party relates to power and the way forward. eNCA

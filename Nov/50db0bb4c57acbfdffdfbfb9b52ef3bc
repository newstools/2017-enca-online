JOHANNESBURG – South Africa’s long-term credit rating remains ‘BB+', otherwise known as junk status, with a stable outlook, ratings agency Fitch confirmed on Thursday. The agency outlined low growth and sizeable government debt as the main downside risk to the rating. READ: Mini-budget disappoints Fitch Fitch said on the upside, South Africa’s weaknesses were balanced by favourable government debt structures, deep local capital markets and a flexible exchange rate. The statement largely touched on Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s mid-term budget, a big event since the last round of reviews. National Treasury welcomed the decision, saying it provided South Africa with an opportunity to address issues that could lead to a ratings improvement. Agencies S&P and Moodys will announce their decisions on Friday. It’s expected that Moodys will join other agencies who have already downgraded South Africa to junk.

JOHANNESURG – Workers at Harmony Gold’s Kusasalethu mine did not report for work on Sunday evening. The move comes in response to the dismissal of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union’s (Amcu) branch leadership, the mine said on Monday. The company issued an ultimatum to employees calling them to return to work. Harmony Gold indicated it could approach the Labour Court for an urgent interdict to halt the illegal strike. READ: Coal miners wage strike looming Mine management was said to have presided over the dismissal of Amcu branch leaders, which was apparently done after an extensive legal disciplinary process. The sackings follow a number of reported incidents of illegal industrial action dating back to the beginning of 2017. Harmony Gold said it would stand by the decision to fire union leaders. “It is important that discipline at the mine be restored to ensure the sustainability of the mine,” CEO Peter Steenkamp added. eNCA

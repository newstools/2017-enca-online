PRETORIA - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane says President Jacob Zuma's declaration of assets is severely lacking. The DA inspected the declarations on Monday after President Zuma failed to answer Parliamentary questions on payments he allegedly received from a businessman. According to Maimane, "What became very clear when viewing the record is that none of that info was declared by the president. Furthermore, in the president's declaration, he declares only in 2016 that Roy Moodley allowed him to use a Durban beach front property for use, outside of that he makes no declaration of that. "The President made no declaration of the loan he would have gotten in the upgrade on the Nkandla matter, which would be common cause. If I own a loan as an MP, part of my declaration is to make it public, so the loan wasn't declared. "It also became clear there were no trips, no donations from Schabir Schaik, which became part of the record when it came to the president's report in the court case against Schabir Schaik." Earlier, the Presidency released a statement saying it welcomed the visit to the Union Buildings by Maimane to view the public part of President Jacob Zumaâ€™s declaration of interests, in line with the provisions of the Executive Ethics Code. Zuma's declaration of interests, while incomplete, shows that several heads of state showered Zuma with gifts. eNCA

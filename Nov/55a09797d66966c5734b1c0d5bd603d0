JOHANNESBURG – Nearly 17 years after they last graced South African stages, Collective Soul will be shining their lights on Joburg and Cape Town in 2018. The multi-platinum American rock band will perform at the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg on February 2, 2018, and at the Grand Arena, GrandWest in Cape Town on February 4, 2018. The band is known for their hits “Shine”, “December”, The World I Know” and “Run”. Following the release of their 2015 album, See What You Started by Continuing (which went to #1 on the US Billboard’s Alternative Album Chart), the band decided to embark on a 160-show world tour over the following two years. The band remains unpretentious and true to their roots. “We’re an honest rock ‘n’ roll band,” said frontman Ed Roland. “We’re not going to pretend like we’re something else. We’re not chasing anything. We are proud of our accomplishments and what we do. We pride ourselves on playing rock ‘n’ roll. So, let’s f***ing rock.” Collective Soul will be supported by LA rockers Lifehouse, who are best known for the song “Hanging by a Moment”, which went to #2 on the Modern Rock-turned-Hot 100 Chart. Their other radio hits include “You and Me”, “First Time”, “Whatever It Takes” and “Halfway Gone”. Tickets go on sale on Friday, November 3, 2017, from 9am on www.bigconcerts.co.za. eNCA

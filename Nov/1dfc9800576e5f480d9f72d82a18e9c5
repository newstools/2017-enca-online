CAPE TOWN - The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) on Friday warned of rip currents along the South African coastline due to a full moon spring tide this weekend. In a statement, spokesperson Craig Lambinon said the NSRI was urging the public to be extra cautious around the coast during at the weekend and into the first half of the coming week, with peaks set to be on Saturday with the November full moon. “This Full Moon Spring Tide causes stronger than normal rip currents around the coast and higher than normal high tides and lower than normal low tides,” he said. “At all times bathers, anglers, paddlers, sailboarders and boaters should be aware of high tide, low tide and rip-currents but extreme caution is advised during the full moon Spring Tide. Rip currents are one of the greatest causes of drowning accidents around the South African coastline. “Bathers, people walking along the coastline and shoreline anglers are most at risk during a Spring Tide and extreme caution is advised.” The NSRI urged people to only go to beaches where and when lifeguards are on duty and to swim in safe demarcated swimming zones posted by the lifeguards using their red and yellow flags.

JOHANNESBURG - Social media users were feeling the love for Prince Harry and his bride-to-be, Meghan Markle on Monday, notably supportive of the new future royal's mixed-race status.  Markle (36) is a US actress, notably known for her leading role in the popular series Suit, now in its seventh season.  She has been outspoken about the challenges she faces as a biracial actress.  In 2015, she was named the UN Women's Advocate for Political Participation and Leadership.  In 2016, she became a global ambassador for World Vision and travelled to Rwanda to see the impact of the charity's clean water initiatives. Markle was married to film producer Trevor Engelson, but divorced him in 2013 - three years before she met Prince Harry through mutual friends.  Markle's mother is black and her father white - something Twitter has embraced.  A year ago Prince Harry released a very strong worded statement calling on some sections of British and international media to tone down their coverage on his relationship. Some social media users picked up on this sentiment on Monday, warning that the royal wedding should be celebrated regardless of the bride's race.  Prince Harry and Markle made their first public appearance since their engagement on Monday afternoon.   (Pic: Reuters.) Reports indicated that the massive diamond ring on Markle's ring finger was designed by Harry and contains stones from Princess Diana's collection. Prince Harry said on Monday that he knew he wanted to marry Meghan Markle "the very first time we met", as they appeared together shortly after announcing their engagement. The suited prince said he was "thrilled" as he held hands with the US actress, wearing a white coat, and posed for photographers in the gardens of Kensington Palace in London. Additional reporting AFP

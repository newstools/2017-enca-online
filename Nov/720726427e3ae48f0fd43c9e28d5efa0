LONDON - Deontay Wilder has accused Anthony Joshua's management of "ducking" him and says he is prepared to come to the United Kingdom to make the heavyweight mega-fight happen. American Wilder, 32, defended his WBC title with a first-round knockout of Bermane Stiverne last weekend and has set his sights on Joshua's WBA and IBF belts. But he believes the Briton's promoter, Eddie Hearn, is stalling. READ: Unbeaten Wilder to defend title against Stiverne "I think Eddie is ducking me more so than Joshua," Wilder told BBC Sport. "If Joshua's a strong champion, a true champion, you guys in England should smoke him out, make him fight. "You should see if he's the best. My heart says I'm the best. If I'm not, I want someone to show me."  Joshua, 28, defended his belts by beating Carlos Takam in Cardiff and Wilder says he is willing to cross the Atlantic to face the former Olympic champion. "Packing out stadiums looks good, but the money and Mecca of boxing is in America," Wilder said. "But if you want to stay at home like a little girl, this king has no problem travelling to knock out the champion." AFP

JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula will be speaking about his executive authority interventions at SAPS in addressing policing challenges in South Africa. In a media release, the police department said that to battle South Africa's crime, the minister had focused on instilling an intelligence-led policing approach on prevention and fighting of crime. This entailed strengthening the Division of Crime Intelligence. Media reports on Monday suggested that Mbalula had taken control of the police's Crime Intelligence unit by issuing a ministerial directive that sidelines acting National Commissioner Lesetja Mothiba. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Actress Lupita Nyongo has expressed her disappointment in UK magazine Grazia for smoothing out her kinky coiled her. Since Solange released her track ‘Don’t touch my hair’ the hashtag #dtmh has been used by women of colour to speak out against the 'white-washing' of their African features. Nyongo first made waves in the media circuit by appearing at award shows with her striking dark skin and closely shaved head. When she accepts awards, she highlights the pride she has for her ethnicity in her speeches. In 2016 she called out Vogue for assuming that she was emulating Audrey Hepburn when she wore sculpted updo to the Met Gala, which she clarified was inspired by Nina Simone.  In the most recent case the Oscar-winning actor called out Grazia UK for digitally smoothing her coiled hair and removing her entire ponytail on their cover.

She further elaborates that she was not consulted about the airbrushing of her images and had she been asked she would have condemned the editorial decision. She says that being featured on magazine covers gives her the opportunity to show dark-skinned girls with kinky hair, especially children, that they ‘are beautiful just the way they are’. She ended her post with the hashtag #dtmh. Conventional beauty standards were also challenged by Solange a month ago using the same hashtag when Evening Standard Magazine edited her ethnic hairstyle. Solange posted the original version of the image on Instagram. Grazia UK has since issued an apology to the actress saying they "did not make any request to the photographer for Lupita Nyong'o's hair to be altered”. (See the statement below) eNCA

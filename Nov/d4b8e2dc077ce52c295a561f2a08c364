JOHANNESBURG – With ratings agency Fitch having kept South Africa's credit rating stable, investors are waiting on Moody's and S&P's verdicts. The key aspects that ratings agencies factor in when making their decisions are governance, political reform and the implementation of prudent economic policy. Present-day South Africa is hamstrung by an under-performing economy which is held back by, among other factors, uncertainty, lack of cohesion and policy mistakes. Some economists believe it is a certainty the country will get a credit rating downgrade from at least one of the agencies.  "Despite earlier successes post-1994 where we were able to stabilise the economy more recently we've been unable to effect the essential structural change that would deal with structural inequality, we came to the conclusion that we need to get on a developmental drive and you need an effective state for that but our state institutions have weakened,” said former Trade and Industry minister Alec Erwin.

Their departure was closely followed by that of Director-General Lungile Fuzile. More recently, it was Head of Budget Michael Sachs and he may not be the last to go. Each departure has resulted in a further weakening of the department's credibility, and has made apparent the very close relationship between domestic politics and global ratings. eNCA

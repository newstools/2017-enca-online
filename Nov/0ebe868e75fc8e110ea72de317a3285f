JOHANNESBURG - The poor will be hardest hit by water cuts planned for over 30 defaulting municipalities. Water and Sanitation Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane has appealed to defaulting municipalities to make payment arrangements or face reduced water supply. The Municipalities have been given until the 8th of December to meet their financial obligations. According to Mokonyane, "It is like we are becoming hardened but we are taking this step because we care about the end user. We can't go and generate new water without money coming in and without us paying the loans. That is what we are faced with. Already we have been given notice of our budget and we know that we don't have new money for next year."  NAMED: Water department owed over R10bn by municipalities  According to the water and Sanitation Department's spokesperson, Mlimandlela Ndamase, “Our failure to be able to recover this money limits our ability to extend universal access to water to those citizens of our country who still don’t have access."  He explains: "It’s very important that we are able to recoup these money’s because it’s important for us to build new infrastructure, maintain the infrastructure we have, critical to maintain water quality, and pollution control. Most importantly, our water boards mainly rely on bonds and loans that assist them in maintaining and delivering new infrastructure. So we must be able to have enough money to be able to repay such loans and be able to maintain a positive balance sheet for us to access more resources to be able to deliver on what our mandates require of us.” eNCA

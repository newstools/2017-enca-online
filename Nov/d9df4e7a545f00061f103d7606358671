MOSCOW - FIFA President Gianno Infantino vowed on Monday to crack down hard on racist incidents when Russia hosts the World Cup next year. "This is a very high priority and we will make sure no incidents will happen," Infantino said in a video statement. "It is absolutely not tolerable and we will be very, very firm on that, so we can expect fair play in Russia."

Brazilian striker Hulk said he heard monkey chants at "almost every match" when he led Zenit Saint Petersburg to a title and two second-place finishes between 2012 and 2016. Infantino said the 2018 World Cup will be the first at which referees will be allowed to halt or even abandon matches should anything similar happen during matches. "We expect fair play in Russia," he said.

Infantino did not address British media reports of Russian national football team players also allegedly being involved in the scandal, a charge Moscow firmly denies. But he stressed that all players on every team knew in advance that they would be tested "in competition and out of competition" in Russia. Infantino also pushed ahead with his campaign to employ virtual assistance refereeing technology at the World Cup for the first time. READ: FIFA World Cup: What's lurking beyond the usual suspects?

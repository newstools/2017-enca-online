JOHANNESBURG – The South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) has warned beneficiaries of an SMS scam asking them to give pin or card numbers. The agency has since posted on its official Twitter page that beneficiaries have been receiving an SMS from people claiming to be Sassa officials. "These fraudsters claim that there is a Christmas draw and request beneficiaries to send their ID nr, PIN and SASSA card number in order to win R1500," reads the post.  eNCA

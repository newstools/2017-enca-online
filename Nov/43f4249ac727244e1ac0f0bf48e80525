JOHANNESBURG - VOOV TV, South Africa's first social media streaming television channel, was an immediate hit and trended on Twitter as soon as it launched on Friday.  VOOV is a social live streaming mobile application launched in South Africa in July of this year, which allows users the opportunity to live stream themselves to others using the VOOV app. On Friday, VOOV TV launched on DStv channel 196. This channel started off broadcasting live streams of VOOV ambassadors, in 10-minute segments, from 5pm to 8pm every day. DStv customers have the opportunity to interact with these celebrities as the featured VJ via the VOOV app and see their comments and virtual gifts appear on TV. Outside of these three hours, the channel will play a repeat loop of the live streams. Over time, VOOV TV aims to evolve to allow ordinary South Africans to live stream themselves. THE REVOLUTION IS BEING TELEVISED. #VOOV #VOOTV While the Twittersphere was excited by the launch of VOV TV, the cost of data in South Africa and poor connectivity remain a challenge for many.  eNCA

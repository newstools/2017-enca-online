JOHASNNESBURG – Women abuse activist are not impressed with the sentence handed to former deputy higher education minister Mduduzi Manana. Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy ruled Manana either pay a R100,000 fine or face a one-year prison term for an assault on women at a Fourways nightclub in August 2017. WATCH: Manana handed R100,000 fine The decision was handed down in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in northern Johannesburg on Monday afternoon. In addition, Manana will have to undergo an anger management programme and 500 hours of community service, starting on Tuesday morning. He must also compensate one of the women he attacked, amounting to more than R20,000 in total. Activists say the R100,000 fine is simply not enough. READ: Victims reject Manana's apology, demand justice Not In My Name South Africa chairperson Siyabulela Jentile says that while he is disappointed, Monday’s ruling isn't entirely surprising. "I'd be lying if I say we are surprised. This was just a slap on the hand for us, as a movement.” Outside court, dozens of other activists also showed their dissatisfaction at the ruling. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed Monday’s sentence. "As the NPA, we are satisfied with the sentence, no one is above the law. Violence against women will not be tolerated,” prosecuting body spokesperson Phindi Louw said. eNCA

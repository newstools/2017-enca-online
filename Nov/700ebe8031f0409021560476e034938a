JOHANNESBURG - Safa boss Danny Jordaan has for the first time broken his silence about allegedly raping former ANC MP and singer Jennifer Ferguson. In a statement released by his attorney, Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi, Jordaan denies he raped Ferguson in a Port Elizabeth hotel 24 years ago. "Ms Ferguson has alleged that Dr Jordaan raped her 24 years ago. Dr Jordaan denies that he raped Ms Ferguson," the statement reads. Ferguson made the allegations over two weeks ago, following the #MeToo social media campaign. Jordaan tried to explain why he has been silent up until now.  "In light of the scourge of gender-based violence in this country and Dr Jordaan’s sensitivity toward the issue he had to consider carefully his response, if any, in public to the allegations made by Ms Ferguson. Dr Jordaan’s perceived silence in the face of such serious allegations is because of his empathy with the victims of gender-based violence. "Dr Jordaan has, however, after careful consideration decided to assert his innocence. Whilst Dr Jordaan supports public debate as an essential tool to highlight the issue of gender-based violence, however, in this case, there are two opposing versions that cannot be resolved in the media, or elsewhere, in substitution for a court of law.  Jordaan rejected Ferguson's suggestion of mediation. "Mediation, as suggested by Ms Ferguson, runs the risk that the public will perceive that there is a cover-up away from the glare of public scrutiny; and that there is one law for the powerful and another for the masses. "We have accordingly, as his attorneys, advised Dr Jordaan that he must not participate in a public discourse of the allegation made against him by Ms Ferguson. "From a legal viewpoint, serious allegations of the kind made by Ms Ferguson can only be ventilated in a court of law, where the rights of all parties are protected." eNCA

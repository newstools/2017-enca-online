HARARE - Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party said on Sunday that former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa would be its candidate for president in the 2018 general elections. Mnangagwa’s sacking sparked a military takeover in the southern African country on Tuesday. He also replaced Mugabe as party president with Mugabe receiving an ultimatum to resign as Zimbabwean president by noon, failing which he would be removed. "Mnangagwa was elected as president and first secretary of Zanu-PF... and was nominated as the party's presidential candidate for the 2018 general elections," said a party official at a meeting in Harare.

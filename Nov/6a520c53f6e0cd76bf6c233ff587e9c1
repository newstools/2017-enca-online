JOHANNESBURG - It seems the State Security Agency may have inadvertently spiked the sales of a controversial book. Jacques Pauw's "The President's Keepers" has been flying off the shelves since news broke of the agency's cease and desist letter to the investigative journalist and his publisher. The state security agency wants the book withdrawn from stores. It also wants sections of the publication retracted, claiming they're in violation of the Intelligence Services Act. WATCH: SSA, SARS to take legal action over Zuma book The state security agency has joined SARS in threatening legal action. The revenue service said it’s concerned about the publication of confidential taxpayer information. Corruption Watch has condemned both SARS and the state security agency's threatened actions "as those of highly compromised and captured state institutions intent on protecting the president." NGO Right2Know also rejected the threatened legal action, saying it "views these as crude acts of censorship, aimed to intimidate investigative journalists and protect the corrupt and powerful." Pauw says he is not surprised that state agencies are opposing the book's publication, but he stands by what he wrote and published.  "SARS and the state security agency can bring it on, we are ready for them," says Pauw, saying his lawyers are already working on their legal response.   eNCA

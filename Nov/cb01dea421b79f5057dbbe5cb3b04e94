JOHANNESBURG – Security officers at the OR Tambo International Airport have found three bricks of cocaine. The cocaine is believed to be linked to Friday’s arrest of a woman who was bound for the Seychelles. “After detaining the suspect with the cocaine concealment on Friday, security staff searched her three travelling companions and offloaded their checked-in luggage for further scrutiny. No drugs were found and the three were allowed to board their flight,” said airports spokesperson Leigh Gunkel-Keuler.

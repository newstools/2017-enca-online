JOHANNESBURG – South Africa’s Chad le Clos laid one hand on the men’s crown in the 200m butterfly in Tokyo leg of the FINA/airweave Swimming World Cup, on Wednesday. History made - 4 years undefeated in 50 fly 27 wins in row on World Cup @fina1908 and 29 with World champs #humbled #CleC #andstill thanks for all the support --❤️ Le Clos set a breakneck pace in the 200m fly, clocking 0.25 and 0.26 below world record standard at the 50m and 100m, before dropping off to touch home in 1:50.71, only 0.66 ahead of Nao Horomura (CLB). He then had to play second fiddle to Cameron McEvoy (AUS) in the 200m freestyle. “I really wanted to go for it tonight, but it felt weird. Cameron attacked and good luck to him. I’d love to win them all, but that was a good race. I’ve got to do a bit better now in Singapore and be a bit more consistent in that middle 75 — it’s a bit of a grey area. It’s the toughest night in a while, but it’s been a good two days,” said Le Clos.

JOHANNESBURG - Former Finance Minister, Trevor Manuel discussed Leadership, Ethics, and Change at the Eric Molobi memorial lecture at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) on Thursday evening. This was the second annual Eric Molobi Memorial Lecture. #Manuel: If the #ANC are incapable of leading they will simply have to follow. Right now it appears too self serving to think of the ppl of South Africa. I can't tell you how painful this self-realisation is for me. #Manuel: What is #Zuma on about [re #nuclear] when the big challenge is how do we provide good quality service to the people? How can we look people in the eye and tell them that tomorrow will be better than today? #Manuel: There is a belief that if they [the NEC] act within the #ANC there will be another breakaway. They are prisoners of their own inaction now. #Manuel: The old [#ANC] hasn't died and the new isn't born yet. The movement is paying the price. It's history, it's traditions are paying the price. There is walking over the sacrifice of so many. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The health ombudsman has welcomed the dismissal of Dr Makgabo Manamela's appeal of Life Esidimeni report. In the report, Health Ombudsman says the health department was negligent in its treatment of mental health patients. READ: Life Esidimeni death toll continues to rise "The decision actually advances the process that I have started about what lies behind the death of so many people at Life Esidimeni. My findings were that there were three key players that were involved in the decision making and the implementation of all the activities," says Malegapuru Makgoba, Health Ombudsman.  He says those three key players were the former MEC Qedani Mahlangu, the head of the department Tiego BarneySelebane and the then Director of Mental health Dr Mokgabe Johanna. "I felt that their activities were really littered all over the project. It was important for them to be identified as the ring players or the king makers or as Shakespeare call them, the dramatis personae," Makgoba says. eNCA

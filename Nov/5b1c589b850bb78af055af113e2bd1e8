JOHANNESBURG – The Nigerian government has started to fly citizens home from Libya following media footage of sub-Saharan Africans being auctioned as farm hands for as little as $400 (R5,467). Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari confirmed on Wednesday that his government was taking stranded citizens home from the North African country before they could be auctioned off as slaves. The UN International Organisation for Migration confirmed that 239 Nigerians were flown home from the Libyan capital Tripoli on Tuesday.

JOHANNESBURG â€“ It's been a month since Mduduzi Manana pleaded guilty to three assault charges. The former deputy minister of higher education will know his fate on Monday. Mitigation of sentence kicked off with two key witnesses at the Randburg magistrate's court. A probation officer tabled a report recommending community service and R100,000 fine for the accused. UPDATE: Manana admits to stealing Coke, no cameras in case The second witness, a correctional services officer, presented a report exploring house arrest as an option, which would restrict Manana. But the state was clear and said community service was not sufficient punishment. Prosecutors also rebutted the proposed fine and said the minister could easily afford it. The victims have asked for about R100,000 compensation each. This amount does not include the medical bills each incurred after the August assault. eNCA

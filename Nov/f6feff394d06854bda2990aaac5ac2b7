Helen Zille tweeted herself into more trouble. US President Donald Trump has done the same.  South Africans destroyed Bell Pottinger while the #GuptaLeaks continue to reveal serious corruption in government departments and state-owned enterprises.  Zapiro spoke to Weekend Wake Up's Ayanda-Allie Paine.

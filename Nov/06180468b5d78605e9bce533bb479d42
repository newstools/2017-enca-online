JOHANNESBURG - A strike has been averted in the coal sector after the National Union of Mineworkers and the Chamber of Mines signed a 3-year wage agreement. The Chamber of Mines represented Anglo American Coal, Exxaro and Glencore. “After months of negotiations, we have reached an agreement which not only represents a reasonably balanced outcome, but will also secure stability in the industry for a three-year period,” said Motsamai Motlhamme from the Chamber of Mines. “This is in the best interests of employees, the industry and the country as a whole.” READ: Harmony Gold’s Kusasalethu miners end strike The lowest-paid workers at five of the six companies will get an increase of R850 to R1,100 this year.

JOHANNESBURG - Hip-hop artist Cassper Nyovest was in eNCA anchor Shahan Ramkissoon's firing line on Friday. I just had to ask @CassperNyovest abt #AKA just for fun yazi #CassperNyovest #CassperOnTheLead #FillupFNB https://t.co/4P1hCWh44U Nyovest is hoping to attract a capacity crowd to the FNB stadium in December, having already filled The Dome and Orlando Stadium. He said he was successful because his music appeals to a wide range of South Africans. “The one thing that stirred the crossover was that I’m so South African, I’m so authentic. And I don’t mean just South African like I’m hood but in all aspects. "I’ve hung out with black, white, coloured as friends as a kid. So I know how everyone speaks and because of that when I make music it’s not only to appeal to the average hip-hop listener.” eNCA

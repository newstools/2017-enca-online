JOHANNESBURG - South African government bonds weakened on Monday after S&P Global ratings on Friday downgraded the country’s local currency debt to sub-investment grade, while Moody’s placed the country on review for downgrade. The rand, which had tumbled 2 percent on Friday, recovered in early trade on Monday at 14.0750 per dollar, as of 0645 GMT, 0.65 percent firmer than its New York close on Friday.

Both S&P and Moody’s cited deterioration in South Africa’s economic growth prospects and public finances. Moody’s said the review will allow it to assess the South African authorities’ willingness and ability to respond to the rising pressures through growth-supportive fiscal adjustments that raise revenues and contain expenditures. “The review period may not conclude until the size and the composition of the 2018 budget is known next February,” Moody’s senior analyst for South Africa, Zuzana Brixiova, said in a statement.

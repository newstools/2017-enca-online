CAPE TOWN – Parliament’s inquiry into the mismanagement of funds at state-owned enterprises continued in Cape Town on Tuesday. Former Eskom CEO Tshediso Matona said his time at the power giant was plagued by infighting among board members. WATCH: Suspended Eskom CEO says the public has a right to know "By the time I arrived at Eskom, there was significant tension and infighting within the board over a range of issues, largely to do with procurement. I think there was the issue of the R43-million that the acting CEO had signed off to the New Age (newspaper), so there were a few of these things that divided the board and rendered the board dysfunctional in many ways," Matona said. Members of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises have been hearing witnesses give evidence into allegations of state capture at Eskom.

JOHANNESBURG - A move by the motorcade of North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, to force the motorcade of Botswana's President, Ian Khama off the road in that country has led to some diplomatic bluelight embarrassment.  According to a statement released by Jeff Ramsay for Government Communications, "There was indeed an incident that took place in the afternoon of Wednesday in which a convoy carrying the South African North West province’s Premier Supra Mahumapelo back to South Africa resulted in vehicles escorting H.E. the President Lt. General Dr. Seretse Khama Ian Khama, among others, to move off the road. "H.E. the President's life was not under any threat during the incident." According to Ramsay, the government of Botswana expressed its concern to the South African government "about the unfortunate incident through the appropriate diplomatic channels." He says the matter is being resolved "in an amicable matter." Mahumapelo was in Botswana attending the Global Expo Botswana 2017 Trade Exhibition.

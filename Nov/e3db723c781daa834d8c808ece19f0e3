JOHANNESBURG - During Tuesday's episode of The Wendy Williams Show, the 53-year-old talk show host fainted in her Halloween costume, later coming back and telling the audience she "overheated." She took some time out from Wednesday's episode to set the record straight. "A lot of people thought it was a joke, me fainting on my set. No, that was not a joke," she explained. "No, I don’t want to fall. I’m a tall woman and it’s a long way down. I’m also a woman of a particular age and not trying to break anything. I also don’t do jokes and stunts, I don’t need that," Williams added.  Twitter was meanwhile unforgiving as users took to the Twitter streets to poke fun at her fainting. The #WendyWilliamsChallange has been trending since Tuesday.    YouTube

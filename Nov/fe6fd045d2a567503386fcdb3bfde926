JOHANNESBURG - The JSE all share opened higher on Wednesday‚ crossing the 59‚000-point level in convincing fashion‚ on surging Asian markets and after the Dow closed up on Tuesday as the market was driven higher by tech stocks.

The Dow ended Tuesday 0.12% higher at 23‚377.24 points‚ partly driven by a strong performance from Apple‚ which closed more than 2% up. The Dow ended October in positive territory for the seventh consecutive month. The Nikkei jumped 1.86% to a 21-year high‚ boosted by a strong performance from Sony. This followed on the decision by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to continue with its monetary stimulus policy. Chinese shares gained in response‚ with the Hang Seng up 0.85%. The positive global sentiment supported widespread gains on the JSE‚ with locally focused sectors such as retailers‚ banks and property cashing in. A steady rand — trading at R14.12/$ — also helped.

The Fed had raised rates twice since January and currently forecasts one more hike by the end of the year as part of a tightening cycle that began in late 2015. The Fed was expected to leave interest rates unchanged at this week’s meeting‚ but the markets would be looking for any new indications that the Fed would‚ as expected‚ increase rates in December‚ FxPro said.

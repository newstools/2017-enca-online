HANGZHOU – Azmeraw Bekele and Muluhabt Tsega achieved an Ethiopian double victory at the 31st edition of the Hangzhou Marathon, an IAAF Bronze Label Road Race on Sunday, breaking both course records in the process. Running under cloudy and cool conditions, the first seven finishers in the women’s race broke the course record of 2:31:21 set by Anne Cheptanui Bererwe of Kenya last year.  Tsega enjoyed a comfortable solo lead in the final five kilometres and improved the record by more than three minutes to win with a personal best of 2:28:08. It is the fourth race of the year for the 28-year-old Tsega. She clocked 2:30:38 to finish eighth in Osaka in January and finished fourth at the Warsaw Marathon in April with a 2:30:16 clocking. Last month she competed in the Toronto Waterfront Marathon but had to withdraw after 20 kilometres due to a stomach problem. Pre-race favourite Bekele lived up to expectations to win the men’s title in 2:10:33, breaking the course record of 2:11:22 set by his countryman Bejigan Regasa Mndaye in 2016. It is the first time in the 31-year history of Hangzhou Marathon for both titles to be claimed by Ethiopians. It was the second victory for Bekele in two months, following his 2:12:49 win in Taiyuan in September which was also his first title over the classic distance. African News Agency

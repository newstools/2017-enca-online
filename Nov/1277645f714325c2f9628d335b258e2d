CAPE TOWN - South Africa has not yet identified a potential equity partner for troubled national carrier South African Airways (SAA), National Treasury said on Friday. In responding to questions in Parliament in Cape Town on Friday morning, officials revealed the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) will not invest in the troubled airline either. There has been speculation about whether the state pension fund manager would assist cash-strapped SAA after Treasury raised the idea.

SAA was issued with another bailout from National Treasury in September. In a statement released by the finance ministry at the time, it said the payment was done in terms of section 16 of the Public Finance Management Act and a default on the R3-billion owed would have triggered a call on the guarantee exposure totalling R16.4-billion. National Treasury director general Dondo Mogajane warmed the airline that the loan didn't amount to "free money". READ: SAA bailout 'not free money': Treasury SAA’s woes come at a time when the fiscus is under tremendous strain, with Treasury anticipating a big budget shortfall. During Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s mid-term budget speech in late October, it was revealed that government would temporarily sell its stake in Telkom to help both the Post Office and SAA.

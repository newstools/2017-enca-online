JOHANNESBURG - ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says the party is ready for its December conference. The party met the 70-percent threshold of branch general meetings (BGMs) across the country, according to Mantashe. WATCH: ANC briefing on elective conference readiness By Tuesday, the Eastern Cape still has to convene 71 BGMs, the Free State 29, Gauteng 41, KwaZulu-Natal  22, Mpumalanga 3, Limpopo 69, the Northern Cape none, North West 40 and the Western Cape 48, he said. Mantashe added 90.04-percent of the branches have held their BGMs. "In the last briefing when you asked me about the 70 percent as a threshold, I said our intention is to get 100 percent of our branches to that conference so that delegates from the branches participate and save the future of the ANC.” The secretary general said the deadline was extended by another week on Tuesday. eNCA

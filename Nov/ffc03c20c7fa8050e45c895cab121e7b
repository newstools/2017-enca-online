JOHANNESBURG – Residents around the greater parts of the northern suburbs in Johannesburg will experience water disruptions on Wednesday, the City of Johannesburg said on Wednesday. This is due to a leakage identified on the main water pipeline that runs through Linbro Park landfill site. The city has since described the leak as a largest repair Job it has ever done, the bust being 35-meter deep and on an unstable landfill making it difficult for workers.

We hope to flush the system around 17:00 and simultaneously open the reservoirs as well. Reservoirs shut down with 1 meter of water left so that they will have time to refill,” Joburg Isaac Dhludhlu said. Affected areas include Morningside Clinic, Tara Hospital, Alexander, Bryanston all up to Lonenhill among others. An additional 16 tankers will be rolled out on the day to assist residents. eNCA

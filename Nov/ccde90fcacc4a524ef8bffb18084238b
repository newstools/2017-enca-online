JOHANNESBURG - An intensely pink diamond, described by experts as the world’s largest, is expected to fetch up to $30 million next week in Geneva. The precious stone weighs just over 37 carats and was mined in 2015. The seller remains anonymous.   (Pics: Reuters.) Previous sales for smaller pink diamonds have yielded just over a million dollars per carat. The auctioneers say the rarity of the stone is attracting plenty of interest. According to David Bennett of Sotheby’s International Jewellery, only a fraction of all the diamonds mined in the world have any tint of pink and to have one this colour is phenomenally rare.   eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Bafana Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu will miss the first 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifier against Senegal in Polokwane on Friday, November 10, but he will be available for the return leg against the same Senegal in Dakar four days later. READ: Bafana Bafana, Senegal replay on November 10 The France-based player was red-carded in South Africa’s World Cup qualifier against Burkina Faso last month at the FNB Stadium. The matter was taken up by the Fifa Disciplinary Committee who decided against imposing a further ban on the midfielder – except to fine him. “The player Bongani Zungu is regarded as having breached art. 48 par.1 c) of the FIFA Disciplinary Code in the match played between South Africa and Burkina Faso. “The player is suspended for one match, including automatic suspension, which will be served in the match between South Africa and Senegal of November 10,” said Fifa in a statement. Zungu has also been ordered to pay the cost of the sitting, which took place on Thursday.

PARLIAMENT – Members of the controversial Gupta family must be invited to testify, Parliament’s portfolio committee on Public Enterprises heard on Wednesday. The request was made by members of Parliament (MP’s) in Cape Town. Former Eskom board chairperson Zola Tsotsi on Wednesday told the hearing that Tony Gupta threatened to fire him during a meeting. He said the Guptas’s threat followed Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown's warning against interfering in management issues. Tsotsi said he resisted pressure from Brown and one of the Gupta brothers. “I was approached by Tony Gupta, who requested that we meet,” he said. “At the meeting, Tony told me that you are not helping us with anything. We are the ones who put you in the position you are in and we are the ones who can take you out. “My response was do what you have to do and let me carry on with the job that Cabinet appointed me to do,” he added. READ: Minister Brown testifies at Parliamentary inquiry on Eskom Tsotsi revealed how the Guptas influenced the appointment of board members at the parastatal. The latest revelations prompted MPs to ask for the Guptas to be subpoenaed to testify before the inquiry. The ANC's Mondli Gungubele said the Gupta family must be called to the hearings, with Steven Swart from the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) suggesting President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, Gupta business associate Salim Essa and Eric Wood be called as well. The IFP’s Narend Singh even proposed that Zuma himself appear before the committee. eNCA

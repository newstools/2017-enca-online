JOHANNESBURG -Â ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe is rejecting claims he's in the firing line.
	
	Sources say NEC member Fikile Mbalula has been asked to lead a task team looking at Mantashe's role, as well as the leadership crisis in the Eastern Cape. Mantashe is on Cyril Ramaphosa's leadership list, should he be elected party president. UPDATE: Mantashe removal claims 'false, malicious' On Monday, sources said the NEC meeting was discussing Mantashe's possible removal. The ANC later dismissed the claim, saying it was designed to sow division and confusion. The party will divulge the outcomes of its meeting later on Tuesday. * eNCA will bring you that ANC briefing live at midday. eNCA

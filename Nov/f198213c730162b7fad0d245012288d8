PORT SHEPSTONE - Residents across KwaZulu-Natal (KZN)’s South Coast have been without water for two weeks. The Ugu District Municipal workers have been striking over employee benefits.  Now officials are accusing them of sabotaging infrastructure. But the South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu( says there’s no proof any of its members are behind the vandalism. About 600 municipal workers have been striking for two weeks. Water supplies in the South Coast area have been shut down and even contingency plans are not working - tanker drivers and contractors are being intimidated. Dphanpalan Naidoo, Ugu Municipal Manager says: "The situation is getting worse and we’re trying our level best with the limited resources to just try and keep our heads above water but we don’t know  how much longer that’s going to take place because as each day goes by the level of intimidation and threats are increasing and more and more people are withdrawing and pulling away." Businesses in the area have also been hard-hit, with establishments battling to serve customers. And the municipality could be facing more trouble, if the situation isn't fixed soon. The police and private security companies are being called in to protect contractors while negotiations with the union continue.

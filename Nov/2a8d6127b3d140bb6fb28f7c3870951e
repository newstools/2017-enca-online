JOHANNESBURG – Over 3,000 people packed the Bishop Lavis Sports Ground in Cape Town to support local Idol, Paxton Fielies, who was crowned South African Idols season 13 winner. Outside her home in Bishop Lavis, scores of supporters came in numbers to show their love for the 17-year-old who last night walked away R1-million richer the proud owner of a brand new Ford Focus, and other extras. The young songbird claimed the majority of the 30 million votes cast. She was a firm favourite throughout the season. The grade 11 pupil promised to complete her schooling while working on her career in the entertainment industry.

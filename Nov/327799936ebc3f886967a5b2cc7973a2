JOHANNESBURG - While the owner of ANN7 and The New Age newspaper, Mzwanele Manyi, boasted on Twitter about his invite to Friday night's state dinner with President Jacob Zuma and Angolan President João Lourenço, tweeps were unimpressed.  Lourenço was in the country to sign several agreements related to agriculture, health, energy, arts and culture, education, immigration, defence and security, immigration, trade and industry, transport and housing. Manyi is seen as being close to the Gupta family. The Guptas sold their media company TNA to Manyi in August for R450-million. However, at the same time, they helped him finance the deal. Following Manyi's tweet about the dinner with the two presidents, Twitter users were cynical, with some wondering in what capacity he was attending.  Its quite obvious you are part of the same society #ZuptaInc Mguptile Manyi. Dining at thexpense of the poor and destitute of SA =French revolution 'feed them cake" Where's Dudu Myeni and the son of ubaba How was the curry thou Who are you fooling you always meet each other Saxonworld And how did that make you feel Abuti Jimmy? Was anyone not captured in attendance? https://t.co/UryheP4JUF eNCA

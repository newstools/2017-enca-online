JOHANNESBURG – South Africans who vape have been asked to lend their voices and be heard, the Vapour Products Association of South Africa (VPA) said on Monday. It is expected that e-cigarettes could face a range of possible regulations in 2018. The VPA will work with government to look at what legislation makes sense for e-cigarettes and try to avoid having them regulated under tobacco laws. For the organisation to do this effectively, they need the help of the vaping community and as with all things, there is strength in numbers. The VPA is collecting as many testimonials as possible from the community with the aim to present these testimonials to the health ministry next year during consultations on the proposed bill. We urge everyone to share their stories online at www.vpasa.org.za/index.php/vaping-testimonials/ and engage on the VPA social media platforms. Studies show that vaping reduces health risks. The VPA is committed to educating people across the board, be they smokers, non-smokers, vapers, anti-tobacco lobbyists, health authorities and regulators. By engaging, educating and promoting vaping, the organisation wants to proactively shape the ongoing debate. Ultimately, with the vaping community’s help, it can influence the regulatory future of the vaping industry in South Africa. Facebook: Vapour Product Association

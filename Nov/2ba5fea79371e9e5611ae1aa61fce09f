JOHANNESBURG â€“ Video footage of Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe's sons, living it up has emerged on social media. The video purportedly shows Mugabe's youngest son, Chatunga pouring champagne on his watch. In the video, the sons are seen partying with expensive bottles of champagne in what appears to be in a nightclub. There have been reports that the sons live a lavish life and receive handsome allowances. In August, 21-year-old Johannesburg model Gabriella Engels opened a case of assault against Grace Mugabe. She said the first lady attacked her on Sunday, August 13, after she had gone to see the Mugabe sons Robert and Chatunga at a hotel in Sandton. When Mugabe saw Engels in the company of her sons, she allegedly attacked the young woman using an extension cord. Engels suffered lacerations and bruises. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) on Wednesday announced the reopening of the online admission system for late applications for school places. “The department has plans to ensure that all applicants that applied on time are placed. We cannot thank enough the people of Gauteng for their overwhelming response to our call to utilise the online application system,” GDE MEC Panyaza Lesufi said in a statement. “Parents that have already applied and are awaiting placement must not reapply. These parents must approach the district offices for assistance.” The GDE said that the system was running smoothly and urged late parents to make use of the opportunity to avoid disappointments next year. “A total of 285,834 learners needed placement in our schools … to date a total of 222,378 representing 77 percent of all applicants have been placed. This figure is a sum total of 123,450 for grade one and 98,928 for grade eight learners,” the department said. The GDE added that parents needed to be aware that several schools were full and could not accept any more learners. “There are 2,017 public ordinary schools that offer grade one and eight, it must be noted that 402 of these schools received applications beyond their school capacity and will not be available to parents to submit late applications.”

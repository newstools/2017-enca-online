JOHANNESBURG – Three “important” ANC branches in KwaZulu-Natal have missed the party’s deadline to nominate a new leadership. Two of them apparently support presidential hopeful, Cyril Ramaphosa, while the third branch remains hotly contested. The three branches are said to be Umlazi’s Ward 79, eThekwini’s Ward 32, and Ward 2 in St Faiths in the Lower South Coast. None of them will be allowed to vote at the elective congress in December. READ: Deadline for ANC branches to nominate leaders The branches in Umlazi and eThekwini claim to have been sabotaged, largely because they are in support of Cyril Ramaphosa’s presidential campaign. Presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is a former member at the eThekwini branch. The two candidates are believed to be neck and neck in the Lower South Coast region. The missed deadlines is not expected to scupper the ANC elective congress next month, unless it misses the 70-percent threshold for branch meetings. eNCA

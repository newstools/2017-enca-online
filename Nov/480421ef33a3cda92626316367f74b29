JOHANNESBURG –The South African Human Rights Commission is instituting its own investigation into Emfuleni Mayor, Simon Mofokeng. He's accused of sexually grooming a 14-year-old girl. The politician's relationship with the girl became public after he’d apparently accidentally shared semi-nude photos of her on a WhatsApp group. Mofokeng is on special leave, while investigations continue.

It says if Mofokeng is found guilty, he must be imprisoned and registered as a child sex offender. He's expected to appear in the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate's Court later this month. eNCA

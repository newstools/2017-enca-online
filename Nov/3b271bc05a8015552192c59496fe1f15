JOHANNESBURG - Sixty percent of 330 ANC voters polled in Limpopo say the government there hasn't done very well in fighting poverty.  This is revealed in a Markdata survey, commissioned by eTV. Limpopo is the country's fifth largest province in terms of population size. About 30 percent of the ANC voters polled do think their ANC government is doing well, while 7 percent has no opinion on the matter. A number of questions are raised about the continued pursuit of policies that fail to bring about change. The Race: Economy a key issue ahead of ANC conference Statistics South Africa's poverty report for 2017 shows this is the very reason 32 percent of households in this province rely on social grants. That means subsidised housing and access to free basic services such as water and electricity. Schools in the province are also not in good shape, making it much more difficult to reverse the cycle of poverty. Limpopo loses over R2,7-billion a year to corruption, and this analyst suggests government tightens that up. Political analyst Karima Brown said: "If you look at the nature of corruption in a place like Limpopo, you often have entire families involved. A value chain of corruption which involves entire villages." The provincial government has plans to reduce poverty by 2019 through the Limpopo Development Plan, a version of the National Development Plan. In 2016, the number of poor people increased in all district municipalities, except in Vhembe. eNCA

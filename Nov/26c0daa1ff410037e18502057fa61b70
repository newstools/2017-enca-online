MOSCOW - Russian authorities said Monday they would improve Luzhniki stadium before next year's World Cup after fans at the Russia v Argentina friendly complained it took two hours to walk to the nearest metro station after jams at exits. Spectators said that after the final whistle on Saturday they were forced to stay in the stands for 30 minutes in the stadium that will host next year's final.

The number of shuttles from the stadium to the station would be increased in the near future, he said. "Security of the spectators was adequately managed," Chernikov said. The newly renovated 81,000-seater stadium is also set to host the opening match of the World Cup.  Russia's deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who is also president of the country's football federation, said the match had been a key test for the World Cup organisers and lessons would be learned. "We need to analyse all the organisational aspects of Saturday's match and make the necessary corrections to ensure full comfort and security for football fans in the future."

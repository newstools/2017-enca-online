JOHANNESBURG - ANC treasurer general, Zweli Mkhize says harsh action must be taken against those who manipulate party membership numbers. The ANC has been plagued by allegations that enrollment numbers are being manipulated ahead of its elective conference next month. The party has extended the nomination deadline to this coming weekend. Mkhize is a recent victim of exclusion. His name and that of his wife, May Mashego Mkhize, did not appear on the roll for the branch meeting at his own ward in Willowfontein, Pietermaritzburg. They’ve been members of the branch for years.

Mkhize says he'll accept whatever position he's elected to. “The conference will determine what we must do and I will accept what the conference decides.” He says the governing party must end slate politics urgently to ensure inclusive and capable leadership. eNCA

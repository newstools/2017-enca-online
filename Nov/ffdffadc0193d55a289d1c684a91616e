JOHANNESBURG - Author Jacques Pauw says he's been inundated with requests from people wanting to pay him for free copies of The President's Keepers, which they received via social media. In a Facebook post, Pauw says he's not accepting money for the bootleg copies. He's urged people to buy an electronic version, or wait for the fresh print run. Pauw says those who genuinely cannot afford to buy the book can read the free PDF with his blessing. The book sold out countrywide within a week of its release.

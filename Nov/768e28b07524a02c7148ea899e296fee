JOHANNESBURG - The rand steadied on Tuesday morning‚ a day after staging a U-turn that caught many off guard. The rand rallied to a five-week high to the dollar‚ just days after S&P Global Ratings lowered SA’s rand-denominated debt to subinvestment grade.

Markets were also pinning their hopes in Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa‚ who is campaigning to be next ANC leader when the ruling party holds its elective conference in December. WATCH: The Race: Research underestimates support for Ramaphosa “The rand would strengthen far beyond current levels if Ramaphosa wins. Our formal target is R13.50/$ but based on current starting levels‚ figures below R13.00/$ become possible‚” Rand Merchant Bank currency strategist John Cairns said in an e-mailed note. “But hold your horses: while Ramaphosa’s odds have risen‚ he is certainly not a certain victor.” Ramphosa will slug it out with ANC MP Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma and several other candidates. But a Ramphosa victory is wildly seen as the representing economic reforms that could boost business confidence‚ which is vital to economic growth. The weaker dollar environment also helped the rand‚ which gained as much as 3.4% on Monday‚ far outpacing its emerging-market peers. At 9.53am‚ the rand was at R13.7555 to the dollar from R13.7563‚ at R16.3565 to the euro from R16.3680 and at R18.3295 to the pound from R18.3220. The euro was at $1.1892 from $1.1897. iNet Bridge

JOHANNESBURG – The ANC held a media briefing on the outcome of its NEC meeting that was held on the weekend. The ANC also commented on the release of the Heher Commission report into the feasibility of fee-free higher education and training. The party has rejected certain recommendations from the fees commission report. It says the suggested cost-sharing model will increase student debt. According to Gwede Mantashe, ANC secretary general, "The ANC calls on government to reject the proposal of (a) cost-sharing model, which will further indebt students and different classifications of students. "The ANC will further study the report and engage on how practical and urgent we advance free higher education for the working class and poor." On Monday, rumours suggested that there was a push to have Mantashe removed. The party, however, has strongly denied this. eNCA

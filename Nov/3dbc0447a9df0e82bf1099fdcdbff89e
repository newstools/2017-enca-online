PRETORIA - Afriforum will privately prosecute deputy director of the National Prosecuting Authority Nomgcobo Jiba, on charges of fraud and perjury. During a media briefing in Centurion on Thursday, the civil rights group's Kallie Kriel said despite damning court rulings against Jiba the NPA refuses to act against her. Jiba is seen as being close to President Jacob Zuma. Kriel explains rational behind going for #Jiba saying its about her decision to prosecute Gen maj Johan Booysen on racketeering charges. pic.twitter.com/lONM3wesws Jiba was suspended and charged with fraud and perjury after the KwaZulu-Natal High Court set aside her decision to prosecute former KZN Hawks head, Johan Booysen. The judge found her decision to pursue charges against Booysen unconstitutional and found her conduct to be dishonest.  Afriforum's head of private prosecutions, Gerrie Nel, will pursue three charges against Jiba: fraud - for the decision she took to prosecute Booysen without facts; perjury - for lying to the court, and defeating ends of justice. Johan Booysen says he is thankful for #Afriforum taking up his case. #Jiba pic.twitter.com/E0Fts4nxij Earlier this year, President Jacob Zuma decided not to suspend Jiba while the National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams withdrew the decision to prosecute Jiba.  In his recent bestselling book, The President’s Keepers: Those Keeping Zuma in Power, journalist Jacques Pauw alleges both Jiba and Abrahams are Zuma's stooges, who will prevent hundreds of corruption and fraud charges being reinstated against the president. Kriel says they invisage Abrahams will continue to protect #Jiba & willing to go to court to obtain nolle prosequi certificate.#Afriforum The private prosecution against #Jiba is likely to start within 3 months . #Afriforum pic.twitter.com/Udc4BbVwkm eNCA

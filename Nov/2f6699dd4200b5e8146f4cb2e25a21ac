DURBAN - The judgment by the Bid Appeals Tribunal against the KwaZulu-Natal education department’s flawed national school nutrition programme (NSNP) tender process is to be welcomed, the Democratic Alliance said “The NSNP tender and its finalisation in July 2017 created a massive crisis in schools across the province, with children going without food for weeks. For some, this is the only meal of the day,” KwaZulu-Natal DA MPL Rishigen Viranna said. The tender process in KwaZulu-Natal had been dogged by allegations of irregularities and corruption, with reports of improper involvement from senior departmental officials. This led to numerous appeals being laid. “In light of the tribunal’s decision, the DA is vindicated in having referred this matter to the public protector for a thorough investigation into the corruption claims. "This investigation must still take place so that fairness and justice can prevail,” Viranna said. The DA supported the NSNP as a vital programme in ensuring improved learning outcomes for poor and rural children. It was critical that this programme not be “captured by corrupt individuals”. “To this end, we call on KZN education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane and his department to ensure that there are no further service disruptions to the NSNP programme and on KZN finance MEC Belinda Scott to urgently ensure a proper tender process is reinstituted,” Viranna said.

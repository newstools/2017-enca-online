NEW YORK -  The Isthunzi star, Thuso Mbedu flew the South African flag high at the 45th International Emmy Awards ceremony in the United States on Monday. Her acting role in local drama series Isthunzi scored her the nomination for best actress, which made her the youngest nominee in the category. Mbedu graced the red carpet in a breathtaking sea spray gown that was designed by local celebrity designer Gert Johan Coetzee.  Mandy South Africans stayed up to see if she nabbed the award, but she missed out to the United Kingdom's Anna Friel. "Thank you to everyone for the love and support and well wishes. You don't know how much it has meant. It's been a great and exciting journey. I'm excited for what tomorrow holds. I have great respect for all the wonderful women I was nominated with" Mbedu said shortly before the awards. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Suspended Gauteng director of mental health, Makgabo Manamela, continued her testimony at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings on Friday. If Makgabo Manamela didn't appear, a warrant of arrest was going to be issued against her. Manamela's reluctance to testify on Monday attracted the ire of arbitration chairperson Dikgang Moseneke, as well as by those in attendance. Moseneke ruled that she should immediately begin her testimony. On Tuesday, Manamela called in ill, leading to much skepticism among those present. On Wednesday, shocking details of the state of mortuaries came out at the hearings. WATCH: Manamela stirs emotions with failure to appear at Esidimeni hearing This included how a mortuary at the Cullinan Care Centre functioned without the required documentation. Families have testified that the mortuary was full when they went to collect the bodies of their loved ones. Ngwako Rasidzoge was quizzed about non-compliance of the mortuary under his care, including weeks passing without adequate maintenance.  Throughout his testimony, like previous officials before him, Rasidzoge denied any wrongdoing.

We have seen... a picture of a delegate to the BGM (Branch General Meeting) in the Free State, bleeding there. And because that picture is published widely, it creates a picture that there’s blood in the floor on all BGMs. The majority of BGMs that have been held have gone without any violence.” However, pressing issues, such as the ongoing court cases challenging the party’s leadership in various provinces, are also expected to be discussed. “We are winning almost all of them. That’s why when there was a judgment on the KZN one, we are appealing it because we are convinced that it misinterpreted the constitution of the ANC," said Mantashe. "Otherwise we are doing well with court cases, we’ll deal with those as they come, challenge them, confront them as they come, win them. If we lose it, we lose it and assess what comes out of that. But we are dealing with them, but we can’t plan the national conference on the basis of court cases.” Mantashe said that the outcomes of the meeting, which is expected to end on Monday, will be made public. He dismissed concerns about the possible collapse of the December conference, saying everything was on track.  eNCA

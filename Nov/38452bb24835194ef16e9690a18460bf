JOHANNESBURG - The ANC national conference is rapidly approaching, and the stakes in the succession race are higher than ever. At the conference, delegates will be voting for the top six positions as well as for the additional 80 elected National Executive Committee members. Voting takes place on an individual basis and is secret, but nominations may indicate support prior to the final vote. Provinces may agree beforehand which group of candidates they want to support for the different positions and expect their delegates to vote for this group. Track the provincial nominations with this map, as eNCA notes each province's official choice. eNCA

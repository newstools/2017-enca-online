JOHANNESBURG – Sales of smartphones in South Africa rose by nearly a third in the third quarter of 2017 compared with last year, helped by falling prices, according to data from an industry monitoring group. Sales rose 28 percent year-on-year to three million units during the quarter, while basic mobile phone sales were up 6 percent to 1.6 million units, according to point-of-sale tracking data from GfK South Africa. “Falling prices of smartphones, aggressive operator promotions and growing Wi-Fi/4G penetration are all helping to speed up the adoption of smartphones in South Africa,” Nikolay Dolgov, a general manager at GfK said.

JOHANNESBURG - The Higher Education Transformation Network on Friday said it expected more unrest at universities in South Africa. Students are awaiting announcements on university fees for 2018. READ: Fears that leaked fees report will spark campus unrest A leaked Fees Commission report already indicates that free higher education isn't feasible at this stage. "It has always been our policy position that the onus is on the state to release the fees commission report, and it is our view and analysis that yes, indeed, violence will continue in the sector and it is bound to get worse in the new academic year of 2018 until there is policy coherence, policy guidance by the state through the gazetting of the report, consultation with stakeholders and most importantly, that universities takes political guidance from the state,"Â Higher Education Transformation Network's Reginald Legoabe said.

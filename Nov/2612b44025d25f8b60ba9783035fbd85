LONDON - British and EU negotiators are due to resume Brexit talks in Brussels on November 9, London's Brexit ministry said on Wednesday, correcting an earlier date of November 8 given by the minister. Brexit minister David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier have agreed "that the two teams would meet for Article 50 negotiations on 9 and 10 November," the ministry said in a statement. Davis had told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that the next round of negotiations would begin on November 8 and continue until November 10.

The British government will also debate its key piece of Brexit legislation in parliament on November 14 and 15, the latest stage in what is expected to be a difficult lawmaking process that will test Prime Minister Theresa May's authority. EU leaders are scheduled to hold a summit next month to decide whether or not to begin negotiations on a transition period and future partnership agreement once Britain has left the European Union. Britain is set to leave the bloc in March 2019. AFP

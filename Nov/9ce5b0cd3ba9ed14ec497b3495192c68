JOHANNESBURG – Sale frenzy Black Friday will once again take place in South Africa and will be bigger than ever. The idea of a sale before Christmas, which originates in United States, will see local supermarkets, tech stores and clothing retailers give up to 80 percent off goods. Some of the Black Friday trends that have emerged in 2017 include more online sales rather than actual physical items going on sale as stores look to fend off the shopper madness.

HARARE - ThisFlag Pastor Evan Mawarire has called on Zimbabweans to unite. He was speaking in a Facebook video from Harare, following a reported military coup in the country. UPDATE: Mugabe says confined to home, but fine: Zuma Mawarire says it’s not a time for Zimbabweans to remain silent. Earlier this year, he was arrested after leading anti-government protests.

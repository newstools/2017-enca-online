PRETORIA - It was a sunny and hot day where artists came in their numbers to compete on the Afropunk 'Battle of the bands' stage in Pretoria. The Afropunk festival has been hosting a series of events around major cities and townships where bands were given the opportunity to earn their spot on stage at the festival in December.  The style and art festival has been running for 14 years abroad in Brooklyn, Atlanta, London, and Paris. A first of its kind on the African continent, it promises to be an even bigger celebration where South Africans will get the chance to witness Beyonce’s younger sister, Solange Knowles. Another main attraction of the festival will be US heartthrob Anderson .Paak. The local artist line-up includes Thandiswa 'Tha' Mazwai who will be performing head-to-head with the Blk Jks. Nonku Phiri, Black Motion, and Nakhane Toure are amongst many others who will be performing over two days of the festival.  Automatic Live grabbed a spot in the Soweto leg of the race and the all-female band Rainbow Abomination won a spot in the semi-finals of the band competition.  Check out the Afropunk website for further updates on the band search.  eNCA

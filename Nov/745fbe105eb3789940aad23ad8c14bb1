CAPE TOWN - The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) made history in Parliament on Tuesday afternoon when the House adopted its bill on paternity leave. The Labour Laws Amendment Bill is the first private members' bill, introduced by an ordinary MP, to be adopted by the house. The bill stresses the importance of parental leave for fathers to give them time to bond with their children. It was drawn up by the ACDP’s Cheryllyn Dudley. She says it also entitles adoptive parents to paid leave at the most critical time of a child's life. "Father's play an important role in the upbringing of their children, and the research done by the ACPD left us in no doubt that the provisions contained in this bill would facilitate early bonding between fathers and their children and that stronger and healthier families would be some of the many benefits for society as a whole," says Dudley.  The bill will also provide for adoption and surrogacy leave. eNCA

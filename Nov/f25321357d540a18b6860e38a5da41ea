JOHANNESBURG – Cyril Ramaphosa has emerged as a favourite among African National Congress (ANC) voters in the Western Cape. This is according to a survey by MarkData, where Ramaphosa scored the most support among nearly 200 ANC voters who were polled in the province.
	
	The new survey suggests Ramaphosa has plenty of fans in the Western Cape with 42 percent of the support, while ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma came in second with just 15 percent of support. eNCA commissioned MarkData to interview just under 180 ANC voters in the province. The survey found just over 36 percent of respondents want a more pro-business approach from the governing party.  READ: The Race: Dlamini-Zuma not as solid as once believed Ramaphosa has a reputation as an experienced businessman.
	
	Almost 38 percent of people said they wanted radical economic transformation and a focus on redistributing wealth.
	
	The statistics are ironic, given the low support for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is often seen as the candidate driving the radical economic transformation agenda.
	
	Political Analyst Ebrahim Fakir said many voters believed Ramaphosa had the same goal, even though he proposed a different game plan.
	
	"All Ramaphosa is saying is that first, you need to focus on reconstruction, revitalisation and self-correction within the ANC,” he said. 
	
	If Ramaphosa emerges victorious in December, he will have to manage the delicate relations between business and labour. eNCA

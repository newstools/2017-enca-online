JOHANNESBURG - SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande has used the Red October Rally in Durban to lash out at the ANC and President Jacob Zuma. He says the governing party shouldn’t forgot who helps it campaign for votes. READ: Zuma the worst leader ANC has ever had: SACP "During elections we all go out to do door-to-door campaigns to tell people to vote for the ANC. But after the election results the ANC regional chairperson decides to deploy comrades willy-nilly without consulting us as the SACP, Cosatu and Sanco who were part of the ANC election campaign," says Nzimande. He say this thing must end and they do not like it. "We do not like it. We can't have a person who just decides to change the cabinet willy-nilly as if he was campaigning alone to be a president or a premier. We campaigned for him,” he says. eNCA

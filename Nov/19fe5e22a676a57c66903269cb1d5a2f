JOHANNESBURG - Seven branch general meetings (BGMs) to decide on an African National Congress (ANC) leadership nomination in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have been disputed. It follows allegations of widespread manipulation of the nomination process and other irregularities. Pro-Cyril Ramaphosa branches in the province claim they’re being victimised. Officially, the province is backing Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for the governing party’s top job in December. KwaZulu-Natal is not only the ANC’s biggest province, it’s also the battleground for the ANC presidential hopefuls. One eThekwini branch executive committee claims it was disbanded by the regional structure because of its support for the party’s deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. The branch is home to one of the front-runners in the ANC succession race, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. According to Sibusiso Mbetho, Ward 32 Branch Chairperson, “We are being isolated deliberately because they know that we are not going to support their preference president towards to the conference…The branch executive committee resolved on the support of the Deputy President of the ANC comrade Cyril Ramaphosa to be the next president of the ANC.” But this is being denied. Bheki Ntuli, ANC eThekwini Regional Secretary, says: “The issue of ward 32 has nothing to do with the contestation that is going on for the president of the ANC. There were serious issues of division. Most of those people who were in the BEC in ward 32, we must be frank, they were anarchists. They are the ones who were threatening when we were having campaigns around ward 32 in the build-up to the local government elections.” The ruling party in the province has downplayed the seemingly increasing number of complaints and disputes relating to ongoing branch general meetings. The deadline for branches to conclude their nominations is November 15. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Health services trade union Hospersa has threatened to pull its paramedics off the roads. The threat comes after an ambulance, carrying an eight-year-old boy was ambushed and robbed in the early hours of Wednesday morning in Cape Town. The boy later died in hospital. The union said the health department has in the past refused to deal with ongoing attacks because of its criminal nature.

The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has also come out strongly against the attack saying it is "sickening." "An attack such as this on an ambulance, which is there to save lives, is reprehensible and sickening," said Dr Mzukisi Grootboom, chairperson of SAMA. eNCA

LONDON - Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah were among five nominees named for the BBC's African Footballer of the Year award on Saturday. Mane's fine form for Liverpool has carried over to the international stage as the winger helped Senegal qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 2002. Egypt winger Salah has also impressed for club and country.

Chelsea's Nigeria wing-back Victor Moses, Borussia Dortmund and Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and RB Leipzig's Guinea midfielder Naby Keita make up the rest of the shortlist.

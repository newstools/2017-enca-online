JOHANNESBURG - Five people were killed in what is believed to be a robbery in KwaDlangezwa in northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). It is believed a group of men opened fire on two security guards and three people at a Somali shop.  The suspects made off with more than R50,000 in cash. The busiest business precinct in KwaDlangezwa came to a complete standstill when criminals went on a shooting spree.                                                  The family of a victim, well-known taxi owner Mandla Mbokazi, said the incident was not linked to the taxi industry. Mandla’s brother, Bheki Mbokazi, said: “That [taxi violence] is the thing that came first into our minds but when we arrived at the scene to see… it's not what we thought before. We said no, no, no. Our brother actually came here at the wrong time,” he said.                                The Somalis believe the attack was not linked to xenophobia. Shop worker Ibrahim Mohamed said: “This thing [crime] always happens, it's a robbery. Robberies are taking place everywhere in the country. So, I'm not saying this thing is related to xenophobia, I can't say that. It's a robbery... It's year end.” KZN Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda said: “We've been assessing the area since there have been lots of reports indicating armed robberies and house robberies.” Two people are fighting for their lives in hospital. Police are investigating five counts of murder, counts of attempted murder and armed robbery. eNCA

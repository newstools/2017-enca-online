JOHANNESBURG - The safety standards of locally sold cars took centre stage on Wednesday. The Global New Car Assessment Programme - in partnership with the Automobile Association of South Africa - is releasing the results from Africa's first car crash tests. Last year, over 14,000 people were killed on South Africa's roads. The five cars chosen for the crash tests represent 65 percent of the sales volume in SA for a year. The cars chosen were the Toyota Etios, Renault Sandero, Datsun Go Plus, VW Polo Vivo, and Chery QQ3. * eNCA’s Michael Appel brings you this exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the five cars that were crash-tested in Germany.  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The African Security Congress has called off Thursday's proposed security strike. It follows a social media voice note that threatens to shut down airports, malls and kill so-called rats in the organisation. 
	
	The WhatsApp voice note has gone viral. The organisation confirms that one of its members are behind it, and has been called before the party’s disciplinary committee. The congress says calling off the strike doesn’t mean there aren't problems, but that they're merely being cautious. The Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority has declared Thursday a normal day. “Though they have confirmed that the message was actually distributed by one of their members, they have distanced themselves. So we’re here today to assure you that the alleged strike that will take place tomorrow will not happen. They have called of that strike and everyone should go back to work. There will be no airport that will be closed, there will be no malls that will be closed and all activities of the economy will be taking place as normal,” said Manabela Chauke, Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority CEO. eNCA

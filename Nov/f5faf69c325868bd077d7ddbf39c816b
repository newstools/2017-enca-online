DURBAN - Two people died and several others were injured, three seriously, when two cars collided in Durban late on Saturday night, paramedics said. “Rescue Care paramedics were called to a serious collision last night [Saturday]; on arrival, they found absolute carnage after two vehicles collided in a T-bone format,” Rescue Care spokesperson Ceron Lennox said on Sunday. One car was still in the road, while the other had left the road and ended up in a canal alongside Alpine Road. South African Police Service (SAPS) search and rescue officers were called to the scene to assist with the rescue, as the canal was about 10 metres below the road level and two people in the car had sustained serious injuries. “The car that was found on the roadway was found with one deceased male, two critically injured females, and another male with minor injuries. It was later found one of the females had been declared deceased in hospital.” Following a two-hour rescue to hoist the two seriously injured people from the car in the canal, the two patients -- one a 15-year-old boy -- were transported to hospital for the further care they needed, Lennox said.

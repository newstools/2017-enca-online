MAHIKENG – A 46-year-old man accused of shooting dead 15-year-old Spencer Tshukudu in Blydeville is due to appear in the Lichtenburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Jaco du Plooy, who is out on R20,000 bail, fatally shot Tshukudu on October 10 and injured two others. UPDATE: Farmer accused of killing Blydeville teen granted bail Du Plooy insists he was attacked by a group of eight people and he fired several shots to defend himself and his employees. The state, however, contends that Du Plooy deliberately shot at the teenager and his friends while they were diverting traffic away from a protest that was taking place further down the road, about 700m away. Investigating Officer Captain Ratati Monyai previously told the court that Tshukudu was shot in the forehead, between the eyes. African News Agency

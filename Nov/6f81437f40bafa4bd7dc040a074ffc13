STELLENBOSCH - The future of javelin throwing in SA looks safe in the hands of 18-year-old Anneke Germishuys. The Stellenbosch-based javelin thrower has been competing in the sports since 2010 and now her eyes are on the bigger prize - representing SA at the Olympic Games.

Germishuys has already represented South Africa several times. In 2015 she represented SA at the African Youth Championships in Mauritius and later that year she took part in the World Youth Championships in Cali, Colombia. FILE: Anneke Germishuys in action. The youngster, who’s currently in her first year at Stellenbosch University, has tried different disciplines before settling on javelin and since then she has been breaking records and plans to break more in the future. "I have broken my school’s records, in primary school, I broke it in grade 6 (2010) and grade 7 (2011) and then again in high school. At the African Youth Championships in 2015, I broke the record with a 49,70m throw." The youngster believes there is a huge gap in the way sports stories are reported. She says it would be great to read more about women in sports. "Even though we have athletes like Caster Semenya who wins gold, there's always news about the men in athletics and it's nice to read about them, but it would be nice to read more about women as well,” says Germishuys.

Though there aren't a lot of developmental opportunities when it comes to javelin, the 18-year-old says she has a good supporting structure that includes her family, coach, trainer and recently her agent. She says with these in her corner, her dream will come true one day. - Palesa Manaleng eNCA

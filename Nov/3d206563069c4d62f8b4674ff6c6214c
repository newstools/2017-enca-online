HARARE - Ousted Zimbabwean Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo remains behind bars after being denied bail on Monday.
	
	Chombo faces corruption and criminal abuse of office charges. The military detained him and two Zanu-PF youth leaders over two weeks ago. They have all since been expelled from the party. The magistrate said Chombo is a flight risk, and his lawyers plan to appeal the decision on Tuesday. eNCA

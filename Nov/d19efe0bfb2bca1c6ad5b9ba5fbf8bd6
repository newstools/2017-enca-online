JOHANNESBURG â€“ Zimbabwe could be on the verge of a fresh start without leader, President Robert Mugabe, after the army seized control of the country. The army seized control in Zimbabwe this week, deploying vehicles in the capital Harare and taking control of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). There has been no new information on President Mugabe or his Wife Grace Mugabe since the start of what has been called a crisis in Zimbabwe. Social media has paid more than its fair share of attention to the ongoing happenings in Zimbabwe, especially on Mrs Mugabe and of course South African President, Jacob Zuma. eNCA

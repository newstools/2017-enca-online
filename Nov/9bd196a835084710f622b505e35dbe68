CAPE TOWN - Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini, has assured social grant recipients that their cards will still be in use even after they expire next month.  Dlamini says the expiration date on the Sassa cards will be extended from December until further notice. Hundreds of Nyanga residents in Cape Town attended an imbizo held by the Social Development Department. Many of those in attendance were SASSA beneficiaries and those registering for social grants.  Dlamini says the department will inform all social grant recipients when a new card system is introduced. “We have extended the use of the card and then everyone will wait up until we say we are no longer going to use the card. But for now everyone is going to use the Sassa card and not any other card," said Dlamini.  READ: Warning issued: another grants crisis looming "We’ve signed an initial protocol with the post office and before the 8th of December we will be very clear on the areas the post office is going to do, as well as social development through Sassa. But what is important is that the experts and many other people we have been talking to are saying the technical committees are very important in doing this work.” The inter-ministerial committee (IMC) set up to look into the social grants crisis on Tuesday briefed Parliament's watchdog, Scopa, and the Social Development Portfolio Committee on the details of a deal for the payment of social grants. The IMC detailed the progress made in finalising the appointment of the Post Office when government's contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) comes to an end in March 2018. Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said that Scopa are on course to find a permanent solution to the Sassa crisis and a detailed plan would be submitted to the Inter-ministerial committee on the 6th of December. eNCA

After interrogation, he led the police to the dam where the body was found.” Forensic tests would be conducted on the recovered body to determine the cause of death, to positively confirm it as that of the reported missing woman, and to check if it was compatible to traces of blood and human flesh recovered at the neighbour`s house. The 23-year-old suspect was charged with murder and would appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Monday, Mbambo said. African News Agency

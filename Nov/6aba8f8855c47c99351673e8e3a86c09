JOHANNESBURG - Former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu denies media reports that she lied about attending university in London to escape accountability at the Life Esidimeni hearings. eNCA anchor Joanne Joseph spoke to Mahlangu's lawyer, Angelo Christophorou, who said "there was no delay whatsoever" in revealing her whereabouts. "It might not have been common knowledge but certainly it was not a secret. She moved to the UK around mid-year and registered at two institutions long before the [Esidimeni] proceeding kicked off," he said.

JOHANNESBURG - One Source Live is a creative collaboration of some of Africa's greats like hip-hop artist Khuli Chana and Osborne Macharia. The Motswako rapper teamed up with fashion icon Trevor Stuurman, Fabrice Monteiro, Sho Madjozi and photographer Macharia.

Trevor Stuurman plays 'The Explorer.' 2017 has been a blast for @ShoMadjozi tbh,as if showcasing how wavy Tsonga culture can be through rap on Gqi,Village & my personal favorite Dumi Hi Phone she also stars as the Rain Queen in the Absolut #AfricaOnFire movie pic.twitter.com/1m1XF6eBtF As a collective, they want to change how the world views Africa.  This not the first of Absolut ambassador Khuli Chana's collaborations.  In 2016, he teamed up with other Pan-African artists which brought about an album and One Source music video which featured Sarkodie from Ghana, alongside Kenya’s Victoria Kimani. The film premiered on Wednesday at the One Source Live launch at Shine Studios in Braamfontein. One Source Live officially launches in 2018. I'm proud to announce our short film, Africa's On Fire, is done & premiered last night at the One Source Live Media Launch. Check it out by clicking this link: https://t.co/IC3WtgdoBT

JOHANNESBURG - One Source Live is a creative collaboration of some of Africa's greats like hip-hop artist Khuli Chana and Osborne Macharia. The Motswako rapper teamed up with fashion icon Trevor Stuurman, Fabrice Monteiro, Sho Madjozi and photographer Macharia. In the short film, Sho Madjozi plays a superhero 'The Rain Queen,' which is styled in a Tsonga inspired ensemble. Trevor Stuurman plays 'The Explorer.' As a collective, they want to change how the world views Africa.  This not the first of Absolut ambassador Khuli Chana's collaborations.  In 2016, he teamed up with other Pan-African artists which brought about an album and One Source music video which featured Sarkodie from Ghana, alongside Kenya’s Victoria Kimani. The film premiered on Wednesday at the One Source Live launch at Shine Studios in Braamfontein. One Source Live officially launches in 2018. Watch the trailer here: eNCA

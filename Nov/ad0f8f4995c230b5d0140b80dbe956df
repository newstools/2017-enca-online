BRONKHORSTSPRUIT – A 45 year-old man accused of first raping, and then forcing his domestic worker to perform sex acts with his dog on Thursday abandoned his bail application in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate’s Court. The accused sat stone-faced when he appeared before a packed court presided over by Magistrate Ignatius du Preez. It is alleged that the suspect dragged the woman into his room on October 23, where he attacked her and forced her to perform acts of bestiality with his dog. “If you are convicted of all these charges, you will face life imprisonment,” Du Preez told the man. The accused is facing 10 charges including rape, sexual assault, and malicious damage to property. He was arrested last week for allegedly raping a 41 year-old woman. The incidents allegedly happened in Riamar Park, Bronkhorstspruit, on October 23. The man’s legal aid lawyer, Ehleketani Maluleke told the court that he was abandoning his bail bid, but did not give any reasons. The State asked for the matter to be postponed to February 5, to allow for further investigations and to wait for the DNA test results. Du Preez granted the postponement as requested, but warned that the case would continue on the next date even if the DNA test results were not available. “The defence’s concern that it will be a long wait carries no weight because it is their choice to abandon their bail application. It is not the choice of the court,” Du Preez said. Outside the court, hundreds of people, including members of the African National Congress (ANC), Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), sang and danced. African News Agency

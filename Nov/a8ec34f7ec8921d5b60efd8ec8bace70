JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has defended her controversial CIEX report.
	
	Mkhwebane says the document is aimed at reversing apartheid-era state looting. She's applied for a postponement of Treasury and Absa's application to overturn her entire report. Mkhwebane had recommended Absa pay back over a billion rand in interest on a bailout given to Bankorp. READ: Parliament files affidavit regarding public protector’s ‘CIEX report’ Absa argues it suffered significant prejudice as a result of the report. But the Public Protector says the issues raised in her report should be dealt with in a way that is fair to all parties. Mkhwebane's lawyers withdrew from the case last month. She says her team needs more time to respond to the claims made against her. eNCA

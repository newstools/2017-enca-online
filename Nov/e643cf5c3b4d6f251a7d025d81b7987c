JOHANNESBURG - Suspended Gauteng Director of Mental Health, Makgabo Manamela on Monday refused to take responsibility for the Esidimeni tragedy, saying she did not have a delegation of authority letter for her time in that role.  Manamela has blamed the Life Esidimeni tragedy on a number of factors. She says her department alone shouldn’t take the blame.  Manamela, says she still believes she was right to issue operating licences to the NGO's who received psychiatric patients from Life Esidimeni. Manamela says they did their best when moving psychiatric patients from Life Esidimeni. She was testifying at the arbitration hearings around the death of 143 of those patients. The suspended official admits some of the NGOs where psychiatric patients were transferred, were unsuitable.  On Tuesday, the Former Gauteng Head of the Department of Health (HOD), Barney Selebano is expected to lodge an urgent application at the South Gauteng High court in a bid to set aside a subpoena to testify at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings.  eNCA

ZHUHAI - Serena Williams can “absolutely” surpass Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 grand slam singles titles if the American returns to tennis after giving birth earlier this year, former world number one Steff Graf said on Sunday. Williams has not competed since winning the Australian Open in January but the 36-year-old posted several videos on social media showing her hitting balls during her pregnancy. Williams was about two months pregnant when she captured her 23rd grand slam singles title in Melbourne, one short of the all-time record held by Australian Court.

JOHANNESBURG  – South Africa’s Dylan Frittelli has rocketed to 76th in the latest world golf rankings released on Monday. Frittelli, moved up 27 places from 103rd to achieve his lofty ranking. The 27-year-old now lies two places off his career high 74th he achieved in June.

The SA player carded rounds of 70 67 66 and 64 to end on 17-under, and it was only through the phenomenal play of Rose that Frittelli was denied the victory. Frittelli notched up his maiden European Tour win in June at the Lyoness Open in Austria to break into the top-80 in the world for the first time. He is also the top-ranked South African on the Race to Dubai at 18th with 1.2m Euros (R21.2m) in earnings this season. Charl Schwartzel is the second SA player on the Race to Dubai in 28th position. Frittelli will now head to the Nedbank Golf Challenge starting at Gary Player Country Club at Sun City starting on Thursday as the form SA player – despite his debut appearance in the event.

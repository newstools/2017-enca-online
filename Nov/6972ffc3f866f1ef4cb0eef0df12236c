JOHANNESBURG – The decision by Kenya’s Supreme Court to uphold the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta, after petitions challenging his victory in the October 26 re-run elections were rejected, has been followed by violence in opposition strongholds, Kenya’s Daily Nation reported on Monday. Supporters of the National Super Alliance (NASA) party and its leader Raila Odinga took to the streets to show their anger at the judgement. Although the NASA leader was not part of the court challenge, he had called for civil disobedience.

In Kisumu, a car was set ablaze in Kondele slums moments after chaos broke out in the lakeside city in the wake of the apex court’s judgment. Burning tyres and rocks were used by youths to barricade roads leading into and exiting Kisumu central business districts. Vehicles were also being stopped by the youths for inspection and the occupants of one car were beaten and robbed before their vehicle was set alight. African News Agency

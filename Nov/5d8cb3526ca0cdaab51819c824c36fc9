DURBAN - Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans have blocked all lanes at the Marianhill toll plaza in KwaZulu-Natal causing a massive traffic backlog. The veterans say it’s in response to an Afriforum march against farm killings a few weeks ago. They have shut down Marianhill toll plaza on N3 towards Durban using blockades. The veterans said they wanted to demonstrate that they also have the power to shut down South Africa. They stated the marches that were held on Black Monday were illegal and they say state institutions allowed those marches to be held across the country. Veterans planned to continue the demonstration until 1 pm on Friday. eNCA

KWAZULU-NATAL - The Kwazulu-Natal High Court has reserved judgment in the case of ANC wanting to appeal an earlier ruling that nulllified the party's 2015 elective conference. In September, the court declared the 2015 ANC elective conference null and void, thereby invalidating the provincial executive committee. The Provincial Executive Council (PEC) however believes another court might arrive at a different conclusion, so it’s asking for leave to appeal. READ: ANC prepares to dissolve KZN PEC Supporters of former KZN ANC chairperson Senzo Mchunu are convinced these are just delaying tactics. The so-called rebels have filed an application for the court to execute the earlier judgment. They want the PEC dissolved and its members to vacate office. As divisions deepen in the party, the court's ruling has the potential to affect the outcome of the ANC’s upcoming elective conference. SOQ)) eNCA

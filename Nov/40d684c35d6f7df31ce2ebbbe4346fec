JOHANNESBURG - Justice Minister Michael Masutha refused Janusz Waluś parole for murder of Chris Hani. Masutha said Walus continues to justify "killing a communist". In August, the Supreme Court of Appeal gave Masutha 90 days to make a decision. Waluś was granted parole last year after spending 24 years in jail for killing the SACP leader. READ: No parole for Hani killer Waluś Masutha challenged that ruling. Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department revoked Waluś's citizenship in May. He's likely to be sent back to Poland if he's ever released on parole.  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Motorists are likely to feel the effects of strengthening oil prices in due course. On Monday morning, the price of crude oil hit its highest level since July 2015, trading at R62.90 per barrel. Last week, the Automobile Association warned that motorists were yet to feel the full effects of strengthening oil prices. A weaker rand is also a contributor to higher fuel costs.Â  On Wednesday, the petrol price was increased by 4c to R13.62 a litre. Reuters reports that oil jumped to its highest in more than two years on Monday as Saudi Arabia's crown prince cemented his power through a crackdown on corruption. Mohammed bin Salman's purge led to the arrest of royals, ministers and investors, including prominent billionaire investor Alwaleed bin Talal. Brent futures were up 32 cents at $62.39 a barrel, while US crude added 20 cents to 55.91. eNCA

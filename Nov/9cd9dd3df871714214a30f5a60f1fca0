CAPE TOWN - Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane is being grilled by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance. He tabled Sars' annual financial report andÂ answered questions on multi-million rand bonuses paid to staff members, despite missing targets. Monyane admitted that reinstated Sars chief officer Jonas Makwakwa, was recently paid an almost-R1 million bonus, despite having initially denied it. Makwakwa was suspended after allegations of suspicious payments into his personal bank account. Committee chairperson Yunus Carrim called him out on his evasive answers regarding Makwakwa. Carrim said it appeared as if Makwakwa was being protected. eNCA

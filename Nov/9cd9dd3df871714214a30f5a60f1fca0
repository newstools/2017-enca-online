CAPE TOWN - Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane is being grilled by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance. #SARS Comm Tom Moyane presents R1 Trillion in revenue collection annual report with great confidence.

Parliaments Finance Chair Yunus Carriem tells #SARS Comm Tom Moyane... “Like our President , we can’t tell fact from fiction these days.. you are providing fuzzy answers on Makwakwa issue. You deflect the whole time. @eNCA Monyane admitted that reinstated Sars chief officer Jonas Makwakwa, was recently paid an almost-R1 million bonus, despite having initially denied it. #SARS https://t.co/zkULAmnKfD Makwakwa was suspended after allegations of suspicious payments into his personal bank account. #SARS clarifies: Jonas Makwakwa DID receive a bonus for year of 2015-2016 prior to his suspension. @eNCA Committee chairperson Yunus Carrim called him out on his evasive answers regarding Makwakwa. Finance Port Comm Chair Yunus Carriem tells #SARS Comm Tom Moyane there is a credibility crisis at SARS that has an aspect of racism but can’t only be that...” @eNCA Carrim said it appeared as if Makwakwa was being protected. Parliaments Finance Chair tells #SARS Comm Tom Moyane his obfuscation and refusal to provide honest answers surrounding Jonas Makwakwa is not befitting of a Senior leader. “There is a sense Mr Makwakwa is being protected.” @eNCA eNCA

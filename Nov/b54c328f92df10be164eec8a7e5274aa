JOHANNESBURG - Kenya's main opposition party, the National Super Alliance, is stepping up its efforts to resist President Uhuru Kenyatta's government.
	
	It's announced the launch of its people’s assembly initiative, which it claims will restore democracy and the rule of law.

NSA leader Raila Odinga last month called for the formation of a People’s Assembly after rejecting the result of October's presidential election.
	
	"We do not recognise the October 26th Presidential election. And to declare that as per article 1 of the constitution we have not individually and collectively delagated our sovereignty to Uhuru Kenyatta. In this regard we call upon our members of parliament not to participate in vetting Uhuru Kenyatta's cabinet and other appointments," said Musalia Mudavadi, National Super Alliance. eNCA

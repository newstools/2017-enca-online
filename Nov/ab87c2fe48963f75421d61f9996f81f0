JOHANNESBURG - While Halloween is not a South African cultural event, in recent years, many locals have increasingly been taking part in the spooky affair. Cheri-Lee Mathews (28) from Alberton goes all out every year, and her zombie of choice this year was a possessed nun. Although Mathews has no professional make-up skills, she managed to create a ghastly look. "This is a very exciting time for my friends and I. We spend a considerable amount of time researching our looks and planning the make-up that we do ourselves," she said. Mathews' close friends Tayvia Fulford, Craig Warman and Kevin Brown thought this year's Halloween was their highlight. Warman came dressed as a priest and the harrowing gash on his head proved that Mathews' possessed nun was a lot harder to manage during her exorcism.   It took the group of friends about three hours to complete the make-up, which Mathew said was a daunting task. But, she was pleased with the results. Putting together the make-up for creating realistic wounds is not as complicated as it seems, she explained. There are a few essentials, though. Mathews buys liquid latex, a box of facial tissues, basic make-up foundation, eyeshadow and fake blood, which she never spends more than R200 on.  For maximum effect, she often hires a great costume and throws in some gothic contact lenses.   Here are some looks that the group tried out.     eNCA

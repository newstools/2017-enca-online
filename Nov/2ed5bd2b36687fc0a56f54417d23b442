MTHATHA - The appeal in the legal dispute over the ANC OR Tambo regional conference's been heard in the Eastern Cape High Court in Mthatha. Two disgruntled ANC members lost the case in September owing to unreasonable delays in bringing the matter to court. WATCH: Chairs fly, police shoot rubber bullets at ANC EC conference At the heart of the fight are claims of massive irregularities at the 2015 regional conference. For instance, two party members who died in 2012 and 2014 respectively, were recorded as having participated in that conference. The lawyer for the OR Tambo regional executive came under pressure from the judges for suggesting that the merits of this case were fully ventilated in the initial court hearing. That court subsequently dismissed the matter because of unreasonable delay in bringing the court application. Judgement has been reserved in this case. However, should the applicants win, it could be a spanner in the works as the governing party approaches its national elective conference. A decision favourable to them could also call into question the status of the recent Eastern Cape elective conference as the OR Tambo region is the biggest region of the ANC in the province.Â  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Chelsea must find the strength to beat Premier League rivals Manchester United on Sunday and get their season back on track, manager Antonio Conte has said. The champions are fourth after an underwhelming start to the campaign, with three defeats in their opening 10 games, and sit nine points behind leaders Manchester City and four behind second-placed United. Chelsea suffered their first loss in the Champions League this season with a 3-0 defeat at AS Roma that dropped them to second place in their group.

JOHANNESBURG - The former head of the Gauteng health department, Barney Tiego Selebano, is going to the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday to try avoid facing the Esidimeni hearings. He wants the court to set aside a subpoena instructing him to testify at the arbitration hearings into the deaths of psychiatric patients transferred from the Life Esidimeni facility to NGOs. Selebano was suspended in February for gross misconduct and incompetence. WATCH: Gauteng mental health director refuses to take the blame for Esidimeni tragedy He unsuccessfully challenged his suspension and the health ombudsman's report on the deaths. The ombudsman recommendedÂ that Selebano be suspended and investigated for negligence and gross incompetence after more than 140 mentally ill patients from Esidimeni died after the Gauteng Health Department moved them to unregistered NGOs. eNCA

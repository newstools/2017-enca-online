JOHANNESBURG – The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has weighed in on a legal dispute between rapper Boingotlo 'Fifi Cooper' Mooketsi and her previous employers Ambitiouz Entertainment. Fifi Cooper was slapped with a court interdict for contract breach on Monday but was not too upset about it - at least not on social media.  On his Twitter account, Malema posted a picture of himself, Fifi Cooper and Floyd Shivambu saying, "We are always on the side of the weak and the dejected. Wipe your tears African Girl, very soon you will sing your beautiful songs again. A proper legal team is assembled to help #FifiCooper against the powerful. #JusticeForFifiCooper A post shared by Fifi Cooper (@ke_fificoopersan) on The rapper cannot sing any of her songs, she must pay back royalties, court costs, and damages, and furthermore, she cannot claim copyright of her songs.

They called Ambitiouz 'corrupt and exploitive.' “We have seen the injustice caused on Fifi Cooper by Ambitious Entertainment which is politically associated with the corrupt North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo.

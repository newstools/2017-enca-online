JOHANNESBURG – The National Assembly has given the Standing Committee on the Auditor General the go-ahead to amend the Public Audit Act. The proposed changes will enable the auditor general to deal effectively with adverse findings in his reports. Until now the AG could only flag financial mismanagement in the public sector. If approved, the amendment could see corrupt officials held legally liable for losses to the state through mismanagement, fraud, or corruption. The proposed changes will allow the auditor general to refer matters for further investigation to the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA.) The proposals may even allow state pension funds to be accessed to settle debts caused by a particular individual. One analyst says the changes also require an amendment to the Government Pension Act. He says this is a step in the right direction.   READ: Auditor General says will continue using KPMG “This type of consequence management is just the type of game-changer we need to knock public sector back on track. Essentially, what would happen is that everyone involved, from the CFO to the junior accountant, could be impacted. If they made the wrong call and awarded a tender irregularly they could be called to account for this,” said sector analyst, Yugen Pillay of Grant Thornton. For the financial year 2016/2017, the AG audited 422 departments and state-owned entities (SOEs). It found irregular spending had shot up by 55% to R45,6-billion. “It shows us that there is a general lack of willingness in the public sector to want to comply with procedures and legislation that governs the way entities deal and procure goods and services,” Pillay said, adding that he doesn’t expect resistance to these proposals from public sector labour unions. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – In two weeks' time, the country will find out who is South Africas' next Idol. The group was culled from four to three on Sunday, with the remaining trio being rewarded with a trip to London.  The episode kicked off with the four remaining contestants being paired with former Idols hopefuls for a round of duets. Opening the show was Phindy and Musa with "We Can’t Be Friends" by Deborah Cox featuring RL. Next, we saw Paxton crying for the first time while performing alongside Kyle Deutsch as they sang "Stay" by Rihanna featuring Mikky Ekko. Mthokozisi and Thami followed with Sam Smith and John Legend’s "Lay Me Down." And closing the show was Botlhale, who paired up with Amanda Black singing "Sokwenzenjani" by Naima K featuring Robbie Malinga. Then it was time for Idols host Proverb to announce who would be leaving the show and unfortunately, Phindy just did not get enough votes to board the flight to London. So, here are your final three Idol hopefuls: 1. At 16, Paxton Fielies is the youngest contestant on Idols SA this season.   2. Mthokozisi Ndaba (25) is a true Kasi guy from KwaMashu.  3. Botlhale Phora (21) hails from Garankuwa in Pretoria and is a full-time musician who plays gigs for a living.  eNCA

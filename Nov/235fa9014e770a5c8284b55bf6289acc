JOHANNESBURG â€“ The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has re-elected John Moodey as provincial leader. Mike Moriarty was elected as chairperson, and the party's provincial deputy chairperson is Bongani Nkomo. On Saturday, the party met to elect new leaders. The two front-runners for the leadership position were Ghaleb Cachalia and John Moodey. The elective conference came amid reports of deep divisions in the party. Last week it was reported Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga demanded action against DA MP Mike Waters, who supports Cachalia. Msimanga, who supports Moody, accused Waters of leaking classified emails to the media. It relates to membership audits in Gauteng. It's alleged the leak was intended to taint Moody. eNCA

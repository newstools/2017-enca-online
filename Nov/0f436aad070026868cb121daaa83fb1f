JOHANNESBURG - State Security Agency Director General, Arthur Fraser, is considering legal action after he was named in Jacques Pauw's tell-all book, The President's Keepers.
	
	The book accuses Fraser of being complicit in the looting of hundreds of millions of rand from a slush fund. Pauw says Fraser could be guilty of treason for setting up a home computer server into which reports were fed. Fraser’s family says Pauw has allowed himself to be duped by an apartheid spy and a double agent who hides in Russia. The family says these are lies and must be retracted. They’re consulting with lawyers to set the record straight. eNCA

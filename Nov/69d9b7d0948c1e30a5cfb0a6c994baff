JOHANNESBURG – A 34-year-old former home affairs employee was arrested on Friday, for allegedly issuing fraudulent permits, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (known as the Hawks) said. Spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said she was arrested by the Hawks’ serious anti-corruption unit and was warned to appear in the Cape Town Regional Court on November 30. She faces charges related to corruption and fraud. “It is alleged that during 2015 the suspect who originates from Kensington, near Cape Town, allegedly manipulated the department’s administration system and issued permits to foreign nationals at an asking fee of just over R10,000 each permit,” Ramovha said.

CAPE TOWN – There will be three World Boxing Federation (WBF) African titles up for grabs at the Wynberg Military Base in Cape Town on November 24 when Kalakoda Promotions presents a tournament entitled ‘Rapid Fire’. Bantamweight prospect Thembani “Baby Jake” Mbangatha takes on a tough customer in an all-South African affair against Sonwabo Twatwa. The two co-feature bouts see crowd favourite Sting Gondarenda from Zimbabwe defend his WBF Africa cruiserweight title he won in Harare earlier this year against the durable Nigerian Akeem Tijani.  The third title fight features the unbeaten light heavyweight prospect Nicholas Radley from South Africa who takes on Makhasonge Zwengu for the vacant WBF Africa light heavyweight title. Another notable participant is exciting DRC heavyweight Knife Didier who is brimming with confidence after his first round KO of Kizito Ruhamnye in September at the same venue.  A former MMA fighter, Knife has made the cross-over to boxing with some success, with his only two losses coming at the hands of Ruann Visser and chalking up another win will put him in a good position to challenge some of the big heavyweights of Africa.

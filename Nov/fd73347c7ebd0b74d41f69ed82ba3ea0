JOHANNESBURG – Chief Edwin Clark, who leads Nigeria’s Pan Niger Delta Forum (Pandef), has called on militants to stop their attacks in the oil region until further negotiations with the government can proceed. The Niger Delta Avengers had warned on Friday that they would resume “brutish, brutal and bloody” attacks after stating they had lost faith in local leaders to secure their demands from the Nigerian authorities.

The organisation plans to send a delegation to meet the Avengers’ leaders in a further effort to persuade them to desist from violence. The group, like many others in the Niger Delta, complain of impoverishment, and an inequitable share of Nigeria’s energy wealth, in the oil-rich area which produces the bulk of the East African country’s oil but remains largely underdeveloped. Attacks by the group in 2016 seriously disrupted Nigeria’s oil output, slashing oil output to close to 1 million barrels per day from roughly 2.2 million bpd. Combined with low oil prices this pushed the nation into its first recession in 25 years. African News Agency

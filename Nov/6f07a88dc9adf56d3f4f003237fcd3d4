JOHANNESBURG - What does love look like in the time of social media? Social media has allowed us to connect with ease and develop relationships. We're able to express ourselves and our feelings easier than ever before. This includes declaring our love for each other and sharing couple goals pictures. But how does the use of social media impact on the psychology of relationships? To discuss this, eNCA's Ayanda-Allie Paine had a chat with clinical sexologist and couples and sex therapist, Dr Marlene Wasserman, also known as Doctor Eve. She was joined by Gregory Eccles, a counselling psychologist, and Susan Sluiter, a clinical psychologist.  You can watch the discussion in the video block above.  eNCA

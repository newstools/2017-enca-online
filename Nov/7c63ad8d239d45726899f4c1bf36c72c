JOHANNESBURG – Zimbabwean taxi drivers on Friday said having the army on the streets has been a blessing. Military vehicles descended on Harare on Tuesday just a day after army chief Constantino Chiwenga, in an unprecedented move, threatened to ‘step in’ to end a purge of supporters of fired vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. The Zimbabwean Broadcasting Corporation was taken over by troops and President Robert Mugabe was briefly placed under house arrest on Tuesday, even though the army denied a coup. READ: Mugabe's future in limbo, no deal yet Taxi drivers in the capital say now that the army is on the streets, they no longer have to pay bribes in order to operate. “These people [the military] are God, you know. They saved us. These two days when they were on the roads, they saved us because the police take our money. I would have paid eight dollars, all combis, each would have paid eight dollars to the police,” one driver said. WATCH: Mugabe makes first public appearance since military intervention Eight dollars is equivalent to around R112. Mugabe earlier on Friday appeared publically for the first time since news of the apparent coup broke. IN PICTURES: The life and times of Robert Mugabe

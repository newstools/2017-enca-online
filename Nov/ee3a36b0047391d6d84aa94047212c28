JOHANNESBURG - On World Diabetes Day, South Africans do not have much to celebrate. With 10,000 new diabetes cases diagnosed every month,Â  we are drowning in sugar - one of the most accessible, affordable and addictive of foods. This is Melanie's story of losing her leg to diabetes, narrated by Dr Luvhengo, the Head of Surgery at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. This, he says, is a health crisis worse than the HIV epidemic. Today is World Diabetes Day. This year the focus is on women and lifestyle disease. INFOGRAPHIC: Tsekeleke's death places diabetes in the spotlight The World Health Organisation (WHO) says around 199 million women worldwide are diabetic. The WHO has emphasised the risk of diabetes in pregnant women, which puts both mother and child at risk. Diabetes can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb amputations. A healthy diet, physical activity, and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, which is the most common kind. In South Africa, socioeconomic inequalities put many women at increased risk. eNCA

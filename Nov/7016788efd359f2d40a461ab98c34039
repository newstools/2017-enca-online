JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwean musician, Oliver Mtukudzi will headline the annual Hugh Masekela Heritage Festival on Saturday. The festival features Penny Penny, Riky Rick, and many more. Masekela won't be performing, because of ill health, so Mtukudzi is fusing the jazz icon's band, with his own. “The rehearsals we doing right now, we kind of have the same ideas we think of the same things and so we decided to break his band and I use half of his band and half of my band,” says Mtukudzi.  The festival is a celebration of diversity. With music ranging from hip hop to folk to reggae, Mtukudzi advises festivalgoers to put on their dancing shoes and get ready to party.  eNCA

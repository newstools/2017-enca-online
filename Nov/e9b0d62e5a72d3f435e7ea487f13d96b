JOHANNESBURG – Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows played to a goalless draw in an Absa Premiership match played at Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. Both sides went into the match off back to back cup and league losses, with second-on-the-log Arrows looking to penetrate the Pirates defence that has leaked six goals in the past two games. Pirates had the better chances to score in the first half with Arrows goalkeeper Nkosingphile Gumede forced to pull off several quality saves. Defender Thabo Matlaba tested the visitors’ gloveman with a sharp shot, while midfielder Mpho Makola tried to catch out Gumede with a chipped effort when the goalkeeper was off his goal-line.

At the other end of the park, Pirates goalkeeper Jackson Mabakgwane was forced to pull off a fine stop from Kudakwashe Mahachi, who has been linked with a possible festive season transfer to the Buccaneers. In the final quarter of the match, Gumede did well to pull off a save from an effort by Ntsikelelo Nyauza, while Justice Chabalala would have kicked himself all the way back to the change room having missed the target a minute earlier. Pirates, now on 15 points from 11 games, will travel to the Free State to take on in-form Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday, while Arrows, on 16 points from 11 games, will play against Cape Town City in Durban a day earlier.

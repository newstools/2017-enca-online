JOHANNESBURG – Disruptions on Tuesday are expected at Technical and Vocational Education and Training [TVET] and the Community Education and Training [CET] Colleges countrywide. This largely is due to a planned national day of action march against the Department of Higher Education and Training to take place in Pretoria by members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union [NEHAWU]. “The national union has been conducting general members meeting with the purposes of mobilising workers for the Day of Action. The union is satisfied with the level of mobilisation and confirms its readiness for the march to the head office of DHET,” the union said in a statement on Monday.

The union said it expect the department to act in 14 days after the handover. “The status quo cannot continue as is and thus we will give the Minister fourteen days to positively respond to our demands as contained in the memorandum to be delivered tomorrow. Failure to respond positively to our demands will leave us with no option but to render the system both unworkable and ungovernable.” eNCA

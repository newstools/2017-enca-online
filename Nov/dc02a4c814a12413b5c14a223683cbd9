PRETORIA – The ceiling in the Public Protector’s office in Pretoria has again been damaged. This is second such incident after last month’s heavy rains damaged several files at the same office. October’s incident resulted in Busisiwe Mkhwebane's office being flooded after the roof collapsed. Attempts to reach the Public Protector’s spokesperson were unsuccessful. eNCA

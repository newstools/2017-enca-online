CAPE TOWN - Wednesday was a day filled with explosive testimony at the Parliamentary inquiry into Eskom's affairs and alleged state capture. Former Eskom board chairperson Zola Tsotsi revealed how the Guptas influenced the appointment of board members. Tsotsi told the committee he was summoned to Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown's home, where he met with Gupta associate Salim Essa as well as Tony Gupta.  Tsotsi said the quick appointment of new board members was sinister.  The former Board Chair said Tony Gupta approached him to hire someone at the utility.  Tsotsi couldn't say if Brown was “captured”, but said her actions were telling.  The chair was quizzed about his claims that Brown knew the Guptas. Tsotsi says he is sure they have met.  Brown took the stand late on Wednesday afternoon and began her testimony by responding to allegations made by Tsotsi.  The minister admitted she was misinformed and in the dark about most of the dodgy dealings at Eskom. However, she vehemently denied claims by Tsotsi that her board recommendations for the parastatal were influenced by the Guptas and their associates. She did not deny allegations that the Guptas were guests at her house. Two years ago, Brown reportedly claimed she had met the Guptas 15 years ago and said doubted she would even recognise them. She also chastised Tsotsi for not consulting her over his 2015 meeting about Eskom with President Jacob Zuma, a meeting he claims he was called to, bizarrely, by SAA Chair Dudu Myeni.
	 During previous testimony, former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe said the public protector’s State of Capture Report had no substance. According to Molefe, the report made no adverse findings against him. He says the Guptas are still open to business dealings as they have not been blacklisted in South Africa. The former CEO was adamant that he did not resign but rather opted for an early retirement. eNCA

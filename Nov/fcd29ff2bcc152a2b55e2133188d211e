JOHANNESBURG â€“ The South African Students Congress (Sasco) will hold a media briefing on the fees commission report on Tuesday. This comes after President Jacob Zuma released the Heher Commission report into the feasibility of fee-free higher education and training. EXPLAINED: What the fees commission recommended Sasco, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and Democratic Alliance (DA) student organisations have rejected the report. The Ikusasa Student Financial Aid Programme (ISFAP) released a statement, saying it does not support the recommendation of replacing the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) with an income contingency loan (ICL) system. "ISFAP believes that NSFAS must continue to play a role in providing financial aid to students from poor and working class backgrounds. A partnership between government and the private sector can increase to provide financial aid to more financially deserving students." eNCA

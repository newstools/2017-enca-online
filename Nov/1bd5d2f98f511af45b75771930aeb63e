JOHANNESBURG - The leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church, Vela Shembe, died at his Umthwalume home on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast early on Friday. He reportedly had cancer. Shembe had recently won a five-year high court battle for the leadership of the church. He and his nephew Mduduzi Shembe, the son of the late leader Vimbeni Shembe, had fought to take charge of the church after the elder Shembe had died in 2011.

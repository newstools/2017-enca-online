JOHANNESBURG - The seizure of state broadcaster the Zimbabwean Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) during the early hours of 15 November and the dramatic subsequent developments took everyone by surprise. What followed must be one of the strangest coups Africa has witnessed – and there’ve been a few. After 37 years in power when all had expected him to die in office, the army gave 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe his marching orders and placed him under house arrest. Zimbabwe’s war veterans played a pivotal role in keeping Mugabe in power. In 2000, led by ‘Hitler’ Hunzvi, they conducted a reign of terror, seizing white-owned commercial farms, killing and beating up farmers and their labourers. It plunged the country into economic collapse and in subsequent elections, the war veterans helped violently suppress opposition to Mugabe’s rule. Then last year, there was a turnaround. Five war veterans, among them the association’s spokesperson Douglas Mahiya, were arrested for insulting Mugabe and urging him to leave office. The shake-up in Zimbabwe is largely the result of turmoil within the ruling party. Two factions, the so-called 'Generation 40’ linked to Grace Mugabe and ‘Team Lacoste’, aligned to former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been at loggerheads all year. Mnangagwa was accused of plotting against Mugabe and was subsequently fired. Now the troubled Zanu-PF’s tortured politics have been exposed in the most dramatic way.

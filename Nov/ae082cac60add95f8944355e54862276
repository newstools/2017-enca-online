JOHANNESBURG – The Sun PinkStig Series finale takes place from 4-6 December for a purse of R250 000 at Sun City on the Gary Player and Lost City golf courses. The tournament will be hosted by UniMedia together with the co-operation of its partners who have been promoting women’s professional golf.
	 
	UniMedia launched its first WPGA and Sunshine Ladies Tour (SLT) sanctioned ‘Sun PinkStig Series’ in October at Parkview Golf Course in Johannesburg where Nicole Garcia was the winner and Nobuhle Dlamini of Swaziland the runner-up. “Our vision with our PinkStig movement is to celebrate leading young aspiring female golfers, in both playing the game and inspiring other young female golfer amateurs to become professionals.  “It is through our competitive initiatives that we will be able to close the gap between corporate engagement and the pro players, providing accessibility and growth into a new lifestyle brand,” said UniMedia CEO Zahira Hansa.

JOHANNESBURG – Production figures show that both mining and manufacturing will make positive contributions to economic growth in the third quarter. Data from Statistics South Africa show that mining output fell 0, 9 % year-on-year in September while manufacturing dipped 1, 6% for the same period. But both are in the positive for the three months to September. Mining and manufacturing make up 20% of Gross Domestic Product. The sectors’ performance will help keep third quarter’s GDP positive.

That is where we will have to look.  But unfortunately, business confidence is too low for investment. We saw those week numbers yesterday. They were pretty low still.” eNCA

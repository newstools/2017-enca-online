LAUSANNE - The Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS) on Thursday rejected an application for urgent provisional measures by Portuguese midfielder Adrien Silva to allow him to play for Leicester City. The court could still rule in the player's favour but did not agree to allow the English Football Association to register him while it contemplates FIFA's refusal to approve Silva's transfer from Portugal. At the end of summer transfer window, the governing body of world football refused to register Silva's move to Leicester saying the documentation arrived 14 seconds after the deadline at 1 a.m., in Portugal and the UK, on September 1.  That meant Silva, who is 28, would not be able to play for his new club until the English transfer window opens again on January 1.  In early October, FIFA rejected an appeal through the English Football Association. Leicester decided not to pursue the matter, but Silva lodged an appeal with CAS in Lausanne and also sought a speedy interim order that might allow him to play. That request was turned down on Thursday. CAS did not say when it would make a final ruling.

JOHANNESBURG - Newly-appointed State Security Minister Bongani Bongo is being investigated by the Hawks for alleged corruption. City Press is reporting Bongo drafted contracts for the Human Settlements Department to buy three patches of land in 2011, when he served as a legal adviser to the Mpumalanga provincial government. READ: Minister Bongo ready to hit the ground running The Hawks will focus its investigation on the land purchases, which were reportedly done at an inflated price and without following proper procedures. The probe also covers the alleged purchase of a luxury car. Bongo reportedly bought the vehicle under his brother's name, using money from the land transactions. The relatively unknown lawmaker, who is from Mpumalanga and has been an ANC Member of Parliament (MP) since 2014, never served in the executive prior to his 17 October appointment to the executive by President Jacob Zuma. While in Parliament, Bongo served on various committees, including the one tasked with nominating a new public protector in 2016. READ: Cabinet reshuffle: Meet the new ministers eNCA

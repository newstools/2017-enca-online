JOHANNESBURG – National Treasury said on Wednesday it has appointed Ian Stuart as acting deputy director-general for the budget office. Stuart will take over from Michael Sachs who requested a lateral transfer from National Treasury to other areas of public service earlier this month. READ: Is this the final coffin in Treasury's reputation? Sachs quit earlier in the month, reportedly in protest over political interference in the national budget process. He is now part of the task team appointed to fix Gauteng's ailing health system. Former Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile quit in April after his former boss Pravin Gordhan was sacked in a cabinet reshuffle. In a statement, Treasury said Stuart joined the department in 2006 as a senior policy analyst and worked his way through the ranks to become a Chief Director for Fiscal Policy. He worked closely with Sachs. African News Agency

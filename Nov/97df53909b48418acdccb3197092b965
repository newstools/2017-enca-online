JOHANNESBURG - Thieves in the UK are using new technology to steal cars in under a minute with no keys. A video by Business Insider UK shows how the thieves can pretty much just walk up to a car parked outside someone's house and drive off with itÂ in less than a minute. Jeso!
		
		Thugs level 100!

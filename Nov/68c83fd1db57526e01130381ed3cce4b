JOHANNESBURG - Former President Thabo Mbeki addressed a three-day consultative conference at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg. Mbeki posed a challenge to the veterans who hosted the event, asking what could be done to liberate the ruling party.  ‘What do we do to liberate the ANC from the clutches of a group that isn’t in fact ANC.” - #Mbeki #ANCStalwarts @eNCA READ: ANC stalwarts go at it alone Mbeki addressed the elephant in the room. "Really, what we are dealing with is a rot that infested the organisation as a whole... It can't be ANC, it’s not." ANC NEC member Lindiwe Sisulu has criticised the current crisis within the governing party. Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, she said there is no liberation movement that has lost as much support before their 30th year of independence. "That is unacceptable. We fought very hard to get here we lost a lot of people," she said. "I don't believe in the hereafter, but if there is a hereafter they are looking down on us and wondering why they gave up their lives for us to be where we are now." ANC veteran Frank Chikane has called out corruption and state capture, saying party leaders are not doing enough to fight it. The party's National Consultative Conference, headed by veterans, ends on Sunday. "The critical issues is that the current ANC leadership is paralysed," said Chikane. "It's not able to do with the challenges we are facing about corruption, state capture, capturing the organs of the state and using them to protect individuals that even when they commit crimes they never go to jail. "That means the people get demoralised and the ordinary criminals think if the leaders do it and they not arrested we can also continue. It has a huge impact on the country and it must be stopped. "The leadership is paralysed because the state organs have captured and we don't have leadership basically I mean we are flying on auto-pilot." eNCA

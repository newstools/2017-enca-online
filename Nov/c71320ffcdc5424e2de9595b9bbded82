LONDON - England got their November international series off to a victorious but hardly glorious start on Saturday when they forced their way past Argentina 21-8 at Twickenham in a stuttering game with barely any flowing rugby. Argentina came into the match having won only one game all year – against Georgia – and, not helped by missing five of six goalkicks, they never looked remotely like avoiding a fourth loss in 13 months to England, who they will meet again in the pool stage of the 2019 World Cup. READ: Coetzee to stick with tried and tested England led 14-3 at the break with a try by number eight Nathan Hughes but the scoreboard did not move again until the last 20 minutes when Semesa Rokoduguni stretched England's lead. The crowd sat back to await more home tries but instead it was Nicolas Sanchez who had the final word with a try to finish off a sustained period of Puma pressure.

JOHANNESBURG - Living in a technological world where everything is at the tip of the finger and easy to download from the comfort of your home, one might think to go to the theatre is a thing of the past or for the older generation. But the youth of Sharpeville are using abandoned buildings in the area as their stage. Modisana Mabale is bringing theatre and poetry to the streets of Sharpeville by being part of projects like Puo Poko. FILE: A Puo Poko stand in the streets of Sharpeville advertising street poetry. "Puo Poko Street poetry focuses on promoting African languages in public spaces using both poetry and storytelling", Mabale said. The street poetry is used to teach Sharpeville's youth about the country’s history while occupying abandoned buildings from apartheid as a place for the young creatives to reflect on the past and the current state of the country. "Puo Poko follows a site-specific model that speaks back to a democratic South Africa. Most spaces used are abandoned buildings mostly created during the times of apartheid, this is done so as to allow apartheid spaces to be spaces where we reflect on our current challenges.  Through Puo Poko, we were able to gather a group of children in Sharpeville to tell stories using their mother tongue without any shame, by using games we managed to help them see the importance of stories without being worried about the medium of expression". Mabale, who has performed across South Africa, says his role in life is to use art as social entrepreneurship in the township. He studied movie technology and has a Diploma in Drama and Honours in Applied Drama & Theatre. Mabale makes it a point to involve the community in his initiatives by showcasing theatre, dance and poetry in public spaces. - Palesa Manaleng eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The ANCL slammed an announcement made by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa on his campaign trail on Tuesday. The deputy president named the team he would like to lead the country with, in an unprecedented move, opening himself up to criticisms of factionalism.

National ANCYL spokesperson, Mlondi Mkhize said, "whilst the ANCYL respects the rights of Cde Ramaphosa as enshrined in rule 5 of the ANC constitution, his pronouncements of his so-called “ winning” team exposes his lack of respect to the organizational processes and procedures." "That kind of behaviour undermines the current process of the ANC BGM’s where members are nominating their preferred candidates using guiding documents like “Through the eye of the needle”. "By pronouncing his so-called “winning” team, the Presidential hopeful Cde Ramaphosa demonstrated his hunger to lead at all costs even if his utterances can cause the disunity of the organization." "Cde Ramaphosa has stooped so low by purporting that there is a winning team in the ANC and thus suggesting that there is also a losing team," the statement read. The ANCYL urged the deputy president to stop using "divisive language" and called for the people named in Ramaphosa's speech to distance themselves from the announced team. Mkhize stated, "The ANC is a unitary organization and the winner remains the ANC. All members of the ANC subscribes to the principle of creating a united, non-racial, non-sexiest, democratic society and the liberation of Africans in particular, and black people in general from economic bondage." eNCA

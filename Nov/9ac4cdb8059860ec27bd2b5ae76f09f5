JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Higher Education and Training should conduct a forensic investigation into how a R14-million was mistakenly paid to a Walter Sisulu University student earlier this year, the parliament's portfolio committe on higher education said on Wednesday. The committe was reacting to findings of an Intellimali report, which also conducted its own investigation into the payment. Intellimali is the company tasked by WSU to distribute funding from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme to students.

This is concerning to the Committee, as it is tasked with approving budget for the department,” September said.

September urged the department to prepare a report for the committee early in 2018. Intellimali’s report stated: “The source code relating to the file upload process reflected the values (R1,400) contained in the source upload file and not the actual value (R14-million) deposited into the Intellicard of the student.”

JOHANNESBURG - Mthokozisi Khathi, aka Dj Tira, is asking for calm from music fans after Mroza Fakude’s fans threaten to “deal” with him. Tira has laughed off the Facebook threats, dished out by the Sobulala uVan Damme hitmaker's fans, who call themselves Amabhinca, a Zulu word for unschooled. "I cannot live in fear of Amabhinca. Who have I wronged? Why are they even swearing at me?" asked Tira. Amabhinca have warned Tira not to attend any music festival where there’ll also be Maskandi artists. They accuse him of undermining the Maskandi genre, as well as being jealous of Mroza's success. Last year, Mroza’s Sobulala uVan Damme was voted the most popular song in 2016, beating Tira and Sox’s Umsindo. Tira maintains his innocence, claiming he loves Maskandi. He’s featured with Zimbabwean artist, Oliver Mtukudzi in a Shabalala Rhythm track, Please Call Me. He says Mroza is his homeboy from the village of KwaHlabisa. Speaking to eNCA, Mroza was quick to dismiss any beef with Tira, saying he doesn’t even know him. "I can’t fight with someone I do not know. I don’t know that Tira and I’ve not sent anyone to write any Facebook threats,” said Mroza.  Even though shooting incidents have become part and parcel of Maskandi festivals, Tira says people need to calm down and enjoy all music genres. “Let’s just enjoy the festive season. My joy won’t be stopped by Amabhinca.”  He says for now he’s not opening a case of intimidation at this stage. By: Zanele Mtshali eNCA

DURBAN - 20 people have been rescued after being stuck in a lift in Durban for two and a half hours. According to a statement released by Netcare 911, it responded to requests for assistance at a building in the Durban CDB on Tuesday morning. Reports from the scene alleged that a technician from the lift company had been on site for a while and was unable to access the lift as it was stuck between the 15th and 16th floors. He made several attempts and the Emergency Services were then called in to assist. After some time, the lift was lowered to the fourth floor where the doors were finally opened. Paramedics attended to six people, including a pregnant lady, with some occupants collapsing upon exiting the lift. All six people are in a stable condition and were transported to hospital for further care. It was a very warm morning in the city, which added to the discomfort of those who were stuck. An investigation into the incident is underway. eNCA

NEW YORK - The game of rugby is played around the world but it’s lesser known that there’s also an aquatic version of the sport. Underwater rugby was invented in Germany over 50 years ago and is now played in a handful of countries. With the increasing popularity of new and creative workouts, fans of the game hope this trend will encourage more people to dive in and give the game a try. Players here at a pool in Newark, New Jersey say it’s a great way to get your kicks. Marco Decastro of the New Jersey Hammerheads says: “What really attracted me is the challenge, the mental challenge the physical challenge - that I’ve never gotten before. The mental challenge in the sense that to really keep myself calm under stressful situations, especially when you’re not able to breathe.” Unlike the version of rugby played on land- there are no tries, scrums, or lineouts here. But there is certainly tackling. Players here say that it’s not as dangerous as it might seem and that people shouldn’t be put off from jumping straight in.  Underwater rugby is now being played in around 30 nations with the next world championship set for Austria in 2019. eNCA

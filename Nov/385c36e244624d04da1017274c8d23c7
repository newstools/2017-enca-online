JOHANNESBURG – Wits beat Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in their Telkom Knockout semi-final on Saturday to book a spot in the cup final. The match was played at Bidvest Stadium in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Chiefs were handicapped in the 26 minute when 17-year-old midfield sensation Wiseman Meyiwa was sent from the field for launching a studs-up tackle on Wits winger Daine Klate. During a heated few moments between several players from both sides and referee Victor Homes, Chiefs midfielder Willard Katsande was also shown a yellow card for dissent. Wits took little time to make the one-man advantage count, with English striker James Keene heading home in the 29th minute. Earlier, Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune did well to keep a powerful shot from Wits’ Egyptian striker Amr Gamal out, while the well-worked offside trap of the Clever Boys caught out Siphiwe Tshabalala and Bernard Parker on several occasions. Wits had several chances to increase the scoreline during the game while Chiefs, even playing a man short, deserved credit for taking the game to the hosts, particularly in the final quarter of the match. The win means that Wits coach Gavin Hunt will now have an opportunity to contest for the only domestic trophy that has eluded him in his coaching career. To date, he has won the league four times as well as collecting three cup triumphs. Wits will begin preparations to take on Mamelodi Sundowns in league action on Tuesday at the same venue, while Kaizer Chiefs will be searching for three valuable league points against Amazulu in Durban a day later. Wits are the current Premier Soccer League (PSL) champions but have struggled to find form this season and even face relegation, at this early point. Saturday’s win will be a welcome boost to the struggling side, which only won two out of nine matches thus far in the PSL. Wits will play the winner of Sunday’s other semi-final between Polokwane City and Bloemfontein Celtic. Additional reporting eNCA African News Agency

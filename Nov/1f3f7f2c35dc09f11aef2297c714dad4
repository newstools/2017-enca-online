BLOEMFONTEIN - The Free State High Court on Wednesday declared that the coming weekend’s provincial conference cannot go ahead. The court declared 29 branch general meetings in the Free State null and void. WATCH: No one was left hanging in ANC nomination disputes: Duarte The provincial conference can only be held once these branch meetings are re-run. This has implications for Tuesday's contentious Provincial General Council, which endorsed Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as ANC president. The Council also nominated Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza as the candidate for deputy president and Nathi Mthethwa as chairperson. The slate wants Ace Magashule as Secretary-General and Jessie Duarte as his deputy. It also named Maite Nkoana-Mashabane as Treasurer General. The court ruling comes just two weeks before the party's crucial national elective conference. The ANC said it is still studying the judgment. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The suspended Head of Gauteng Mental Health, Dr Makgabo Manamela, says the termination of the Life Esidimeni contract was a cost-cutting measure. One hundred and forty-three mentally disabled patients died after they were moved from the facility to NGOs. WATCH: Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings continue as death toll rises But an independent expert report describes the facility cost-effective. Manamela still maintains the move was a collective decision, and she shouldnâ€™t be made to shoulder responsibility on her own. eNCA

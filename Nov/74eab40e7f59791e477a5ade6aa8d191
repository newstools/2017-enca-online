JOHANNESBURG - The Reserve Bank isn’t backing down in its battle against the Public Protector.

In August, the court set aside Mkhwebane’s remedial action on her report on an apartheid-era bailout. WATCH: Public Protector: Reserve Bank allegations unwarranted She controversially proposed amendments to the Reserve Bank’s mandate. Now, the bank has accused her of delays, false statements and an abuse of process. The bank says she’s failed to address serious accusations that she’s biased, and had an ulterior motive. She’s also accused of failing to disclose meetings with the Presidency on her preliminary report, where amending the constitution was apparently discussed. eNCA

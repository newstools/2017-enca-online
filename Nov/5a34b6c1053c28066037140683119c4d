JOHANNESBURG - Social media users were on Friday reflecting the general confusion around the situation in Zimbabwe and whether President Robert Mugabe will actually relinquish power.  It's totally not a coup, it's a tank-facilitated organizational restructuring @bmgachewa #Zimbabwe #Zimbabwecoup pic.twitter.com/MUV6TmRQXC If it looks like a Koo and tastes like a Koo then it is a Koo #Zimbabwe #Amlive @SakinaKamwendo pic.twitter.com/WS3lKqjewU Robert Mugabe, the man who this week repulsed a military coup one nap at a time. pic.twitter.com/M5Yqf6PvjR On Tuesday, the army in Zimbabwe made a number of aggressive moves in what seemed like a coup, with Mugabe reportedly being placed under house arrest and a number of ministers arrested.  IN MEMES: Social media weighs in on Zim crisis South Africa has been leading the SADC negotiations in that country, aimed at establishing a democratic order in Zimbabwe. Mugabe however appeared at a graduation ceremony on Friday, Twitter was confused as to whether anything will come off the military's posturing.  Nothing says "there has been a coup" more than a man in military uniform appearing unannounced on state TV late at night to say "there has not been a coup".#Zimbabwe #Zimbabwecoup pic.twitter.com/qCVHfzaGT9 Soft coup #Zimbabwecoup I have just realised something:
		The international community is confused about whether this is a coup or not. In fact, it is not a coup. It is a “Bond Coup” - it has a 1:1 value with a coup but can only be used in Zimbabwe. - Author Unknown #Zimbabwecoup #MugabeHasFallen asleep #Zimbabwecoup yesterday I was in a coup world having the feeling that Mugabe is goin n now that coup confusing me, it looks like they r now couple I heard that when he is about to sign the resignation letter he falls asleep...then they have to start all over again to explain the process #zimbabwe #zimbabwecoup #someonebringanalarm My theory: Someone no longer wanted someone else living in the same house with him, and so decided to stage the whole thing!! #Zimbabwecoup #GraceMugabe pic.twitter.com/JDxChAPaiN #Zimbabwecoup indeed went to Private School #Mugabe #Zimbabwe pic.twitter.com/0ldFzOjak1 eNCA

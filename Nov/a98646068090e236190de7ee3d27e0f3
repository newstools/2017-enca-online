JUBA, South Sudan - A tribal militia killed at least 43 people in South Sudan's central Jonglei state, local officials said on Wednesday. The attack forms part of a cycle of tit-for-tat revenge killings that local authorities have so far been powerless to stop. Raiders from the Murle ethnic group killed 20 men, 22 women and one child, and injured 19 people in the small village of Duk Payel on Tuesday, Jonglei Information Minister Jocab Akech Deng said.

Oil-rich South Sudan dissolved into civil war in 2013 and is riven by rivalry between rebels, military and militias. More than a third of the country's 12-million strong population have fled their homes. Kudumoch Nyakurono, the information minister of neighbouring Boma state, said his government is trying to find the culprits. "There are some villages which were attacked by some youth from Murle in Pibor," said Nyakurono, State Information Minister of Boma.

The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) also told Reuters on Wednesday that the mission is sending a peacekeeping patrol and human rights monitors to the area. "UNMISS deplores any incidents in which innocent civilians are killed. The mission will continue to support the reconciliation efforts on the ground between communities to ease tensions and end the cycle of revenge," said mission spokesman Daniel Dickinson.  Reuters

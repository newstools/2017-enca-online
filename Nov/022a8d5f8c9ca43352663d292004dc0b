We are so tired to see ANC members dying and what worries us is that they are targeting ANC leaders and that grows the belief that there might be a third hand that wants to get rid of the ANC,” says Sthembiso Mhlongo, ANCYL Deputy Secretary, Moses Mabhida Region. It’s alleged Mnguni was involved in a taxi business and also supplied food to schools. The motive for the attack is unknown. “At this stage we cannot say that this incident is politically motivated investigation are still continuing and the motive the attack is still,” says Nqobile Gwala, KZN Police Spokesperson.

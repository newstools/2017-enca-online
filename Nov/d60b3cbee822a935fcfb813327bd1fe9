CAPE TOWN - State capture was put in the spotlight in Parliament on Tuesday evening.
	
	MPs debated the issue in the National Assembly following a request by the Democratic Alliance. Parliament’s duty to investigate and hold the executive to account was to be discussed. WATCH: Zuma's state capture court bid in quotes President Jacob Zuma has challenged the former Public Protector's recommendation, compelling him to appoint a commission of inquiry into state capture. Zuma says he'll establish the inquiry within 30 days once Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report is set aside. That report implicates the Guptas in allegations of state capture, with President Zuma a central figure. Zuma has also accused of violating the Executive Members Ethics Code by failing to investigate the claims. eNCA

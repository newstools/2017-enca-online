DURBAN - An ANC branch meeting in iNanda, Durban has been marred by chaos. Ward 57 was due to hold its branch general meeting on Sunday. The branch is believed to back Cyril Ramaphosa to lead the party. But his competition for the post, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, also enjoys support in the area. By early evening, the meeting had still not begun. It began as a jovial, vibrant gathering with ANC NEC member, Jackson Mthembu preaching unity and tolerance.  But, things quickly degenerated into chaos, with a taxi carrying ANC members trying tries to force his way into the closed meeting venue. Those on the other side of the gate demanded he offload his passengers so they can produce their membership cards. Ramaphosa supporters claim membership manipulation and gatekeeping is at play. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's supporters say those complaining are no longer ANC members.        A heavy police contingent has been deployed outside the meeting venue.  eNCA

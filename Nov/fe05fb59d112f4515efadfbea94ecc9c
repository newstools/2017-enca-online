LONDON - A number of British entrepreneurs believe the market has failed to cater for the black and minority ethnic community. Perhaps nowhere has this been felt more than in the cosmetics industry, where African hair is still often stigmatised. Attempting to unravel the hair care market, Ekwy Nnene has designed and developed her own range of hair care products for natural hair. She’s spent years creating a formula to work on most African hair types after feeling like the cosmetics industry had refused to do so. This lack of focus on diversity has been felt by other UK entrepreneurs too. It’s hoped creating products specifically for the black community will reduce the stigma sometimes attached to natural hair and help provide more diversity in the marketplace, which many believe is lacking, not only in Britain but around the world. * Watch the full video report by Natalie Powell in the gallery above. eNCA

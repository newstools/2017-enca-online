DURBAN - As the death toll from political killings in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) keeps climbing, the family of the latest victim does not believe his death is politically motivated. Earlier this week, KZN ANC Youth League (ANCYL) leader Sthembiso Mhlongo said the killings in the province were not internal battles. Mhlongo was then gunned down outside his home near Pietermaritzburg on Thursday morning. READ: ANC politician killed in KZN It's believed his attackers were impersonating police officers. His brother, Sipho Mhlongo, said he also didn’t believe the murder was political. Over a hundred people have fallen victim to political killings in the province. The KZN ANCYL, however, said it was worried about the lack of arrests in political murders. ANCYL Moses Mabhida regional spokesperson Njabulo Mtolo said: “All people who get killed are actively involved in politics and politics is their life. As much as we can't speculate at this time, you can also not divorce political elements from these killings.” eNCA

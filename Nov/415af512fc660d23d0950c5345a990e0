HARARE – Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, in power since August 1979, is Africa's longest-serving leader. Until now, the second place was held by Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe who had ruled the country since independence in April 1980 but who resigned on Tuesday. Mugabe began his 37-year reign first as prime minister, then as president. At 93, he was also the oldest head of state in power in the world. Here is a rundown: More than 30 years - Obiang Nguema has been leader of the tiny, oil-rich Equatorial Guinea for 38 years. He came to power in a coup on August 3, 1979, ousting his own uncle, Francisco Macias Nguema, who was shot by a firing squad. He was re-elected to a fifth seven-year term in 2016. - In Cameroon, Paul Biya has 35 years under his belt. He became president on November 6, 1982 after serving seven years as prime minister. - Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso has spent 33 years in office, but not in one go. He first served from 1979 to 1992 and then came back to run the country in 1997 at the end of a civil war. Sassou Nguesso was re-elected in March 2016 and could run again when his current term expires.

JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters' leader, Julius Malema, on Thursday vowed that the former City of Johannesburg mayor Parks Tau would never take back his old job as the ANC in the city hopes to remove current mayor, Herman Mashaba through a vote of no confidence. Tau was removed as mayor in August 2016 after the ANC failed to get the majority votes in the 2016 local government elections. This resulted with the Democratic Alliance taking over the city with support from smaller parties which include the EFF.

"When we presented the DA said it’s a lie, then they said it's sabotage. The bank account doesn’t lie, we can't sit back and let it happen. They have under collected to the extent of about 84 percent. They are sabotaging themselves through their inability to manage the City of Johannesburg," he said.

Maybe someone from our generation and not now perhaps in future, I can’t commit." he tweeted. eNCA

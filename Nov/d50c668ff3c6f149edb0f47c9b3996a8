JOHANNESBURG - The suspended Gauteng director of mental health is expected to continue her testimony at the Esidimeni arbitration hearings. If Makgabo Manamela does not appear, a warrant of arrest will be issued against her. Manamela called in ill at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings on Tuesday. After her reluctance to testify on Monday, her failure to appear was not taken well by arbitration chairperson Dikgang Moseneke, as well as by those in attendance. On Wednesday, shocking details of the state of mortuaries came out at the hearings.

CAPE TOWN - Mayor, Patricia de Lille will be making a major announcement to residents about the impact the drought could have on the city. The city is currently implementing level five water restrictions and residents are allocated 87 liters per person for a household of four. Water restrictors are also being installed at houses where the daily allowance is exceeded. While there’s been some rainfall in recent days, it has not been enough to make any significant impact on dam levels. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Netcare shareholders will receive a dividend despite the company’s decline in earnings. The group recorded a total net loss of R2.7-billion for the year ending September. The rand’s strength against the pound sterling during the year cut the company’s revenue by almost R4-billion. Patient day numbers dropped in Netcare’s local operations, with higher-revenue in patients in the UK market also dropping. The company declared a 57 cents final dividend, bringing the year’s total to 95 cents a share. eNCA

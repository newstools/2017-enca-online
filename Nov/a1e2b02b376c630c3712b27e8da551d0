PRETORIA - Young people and women remain two of the most disadvantaged groups when it comes to entering South Africa's ailing jobs market. The Jobs Fund Learning Forum, which is a multi-year R9-billion project administered by the National Treasury, brought together experts from civil society, government, and the private sector, to discuss ways of creating employment. Development experts say to grow the economy, South Africa needs to adopt several medium- to long-term strategies. These include improving the county’s macroeconomic policy environment, infrastructure, the education system and regulatory policies.

What’s important is to link the job seekers with the employers,” Professor Leila Patel from the UJ Centre for Social Development in Africa. “Our biggest problem is that unemployment is growing for young people. It has increased hugely since 2008." Nearly 39-percent of South Africa's youth are unemployed with women also facing greater obstacles in the labour market, while at the same time playing an important role in marginalised communities, where they often support extended families.

Developmental practitioners say women and youth should play a bigger role in policy direction. “It means bringing young people into the conversation,” said Youth Lab Director Pearl Pillay. “Having young people shape the way policy goes. Now policy shapes people’s lives. We need to shift power dynamics. Swift who we prioritize in creating solutions.” The Jobs Fund hopes to create 150, 000 permanent jobs by providing people from disadvantaged groups with the skills needed to enter the job market. eNCA

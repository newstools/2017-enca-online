JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has warned “haters” of the Education Amendment Bill not to test his patience. Lesufi has hit back at insults by those he described as being very nolstagic about the past era. The bill has come in for severe criticism, with many stakeholders feeling it limits the powers of School Governing Bodies (SGBs) excessively, especially as it relates to the appointment of teachers, admission and language policies, and certain financial decisions.

These, we owe to previous, current, and future generations of South Africa.” READ: SA’s 2018 online school places applications reopened Lesufi said the country “cannot be held at ransom by non-progressive and self-centred beneficiaries of the past and haters of transformation, who think that education of majority  of our people must continue to be ignored.” He has urged the minister of education to extend the deadline for the submissions and to push ahead with the changes.

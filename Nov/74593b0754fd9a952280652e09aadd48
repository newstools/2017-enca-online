NAIROBI - Kenyan police fired teargas and clashed with both ruling party and opposition supporters on Tuesday ahead of the swearing-in as president of Uhuru Kenyatta after two disputed polls that have left the nation deeply divided. As foreign and local dignitaries poured into the 60,000-seat Kasarani stadium in Nairobi where the ceremony is to be held, the opposition attempted to gather for a "memorial rally" honouring the more than 50 people killed, mostly by police, in four months of political upheaval. However police fired volleys of teargas and beat opposition supporters, prompting running battles in the area, an AFP reporter said. Meanwhile at the Kasarani stadium chaos erupted as a crowd attempted to force its way into the venue, prompting police to fire teargas at Kenyatta supporters who tried to fight their way in.

Joseph Irungu of the interior ministry planning committee had said there was space for 40,000 people who did not get in to watch the event on big screens outside the stadium. However, no such screens were provided, further angering the crowd. Around 13 mostly African heads of state are expected to attend the ceremony where Kenyatta will be sworn in for his second and final five-year term. AFP

Sneaker reseller, Nino Jay explained, “there is also another side where you check what do people want, where can I get those for them, how can I bring them here, stuff like that.“ And that means a much high cost for the consumer, compared to the price tag at the store. Nino says being the first to get a rare sneaker requires sacrifice. Other sneakerheads at the event say their shoes define them. Sneakerness is considered the most important event in the European sneaker and footwear scene. It comes to an end on Sunday. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Packaged goods company, Tiger Brands says a drop in food inflation has not prompted consumers to spend more on food items.
	
	The company believes rising petrol and water prices are hampering consumer confidence. The food and beverage maker saw annual revenue increase in the year ending 30th September, partly due to improved pricing strategies and better cost control. The country’s biggest consumer foods producer reported a 2 percent rise in full-year profits. This as Tiger Brands refocuses its strategy on the slow-growing domestic market, after making costly inroads into the rest of the continent. While acknowledging a drop in food inflation, the company says consumers have not spent the money they saved, on food. “Food inflation in the second half slowed to about 3 percent. Maize prices reduced by 45- percent in the second half,” said Lawrence Macdougall CEO at Tiger Brands.  READ: Good news for consumers as inflation drops “That should have returned a lot of capital back to the consumers. That gives back to the consumer about R6 - 10billion… significant amount of cash that has been returned. On some of those staples we hope to see some resurgence in the near future as the pricing becomes more affordable.”
	
	Domestic sales were up 4-percent, to just over R27-billion, driven by grains and groceries. Exports and international division revenue dropped by five-percent, as the stronger rand hit the deciduous fruit business. The company says the lingering drought is still impacting its work, and plans are afoot to ensure less water usage.
	
	“We have strong programmes at each of our manufacturing sites to make sure our efficiency programmes are generating the right results. But water yes the cost increases that we’ve seen in water is dramatic. If uncontrolled will have an impact on pricing,” Macdougall said.
	
	The company expects a muted outlook for 2018, amid weak consumer spending. eNCA

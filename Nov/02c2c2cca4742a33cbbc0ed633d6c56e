CAPE TOWN - Firefighters in Cape Town were on Wednesday still battling several blazes around the Cape Peninsula. A large fire in Gordon’s Bay which destroyed several dwellings, as well as an animal shelter on Tuesday, was being monitored on Wednesday morning. Strong winds had fanned the fire on Tuesday but according to Theo Layne of the City’s Fire Department, the fire was being monitored and “firefighters are dealing with the hotspots and possible flare-ups should they occur”.

Very sad news.

Meanwhile, the dry windy conditions also saw a fire at Red Hill above Simon’s Town. According to the City of Cape Town, several structures were affected at the Simon’s Town naval base while the blaze spread in the direction of Scarborough. “We had a fire that started at about 20.30pm at Red Hill,” a City spokesperson said. “The Red Hill fire is contained but active firefighting is still actively taking place.” African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - Water supplies in Johannesburg were normal on Thursday afternoon following a burst pipe that left city’s northern areas without water for three days. Joburg Water said engineers continued to work on what it called the “largest repair job in its history” on Thursday morning. "Reservoirs have been partially opened to charge the lines. This is done at a slow pace to avoid any further bursts. Affected areas included Sandton, Alexandra, Bryanston, Morningside and Linbro Park. Supply to high-lying areas would take longer to restore, Joburg Water said. MCC for Environment and Infrastructure Services Nico de Jager said the pipe burst took place 35 metres deep at an unstable land site at Linbro Park landfill site. African News Agency

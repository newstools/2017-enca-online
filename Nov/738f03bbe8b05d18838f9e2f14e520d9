JOHANNESBURG - Explosive revelations, denials, threats of legal action, defiance and record sales. Jacques Pauw's latest book contains dramatic allegations about President Zuma and those close to him. The drama hasn't been confined to the pages of The President's Keepers, with state agencies trying to have it removed from the shelves and the public promptly buying all available copies of the first print run. Pauw has vowed not to recall the book from the shelves as State Security Agency Director General, Arthur Fraser, who is implicated in the book, seeks legal action. The author spoke at length to eNCA about his explosive book. Pauw confirmed he has received death threats since the release of the book.  eNCA

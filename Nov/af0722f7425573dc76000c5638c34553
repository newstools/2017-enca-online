JOHANNESBURG - The Black Business Council is looking to the East for new business opportunities. It's signed a memorandum of understanding with the Singapore Manufacturing Federation. South Africa's battling rampant unemployment and sluggish economic growth, and the Black Business Council believes it has found one way to help remedy these challenges.   According to Sello Rasethaba of the Black Business Council, "The most important thing is jobs for our people. So we are here today to persuade them, to say that since they manufacture certain goods in their countries and particularly export them to Indonesia and China, why can’t they bring some of those manufacturing facilities to South Africa and open them up with black industrialists?" The Singapore Manufacturing Federation says it wants to expand on the African continent and work on what it calls co-creation with the continent. According to the Federation's Douglas Foo, "We look forward to a lot more of many many helping hands coming together to co-create a whole new vibrant manufacturing on both sides of the continents and with that a lot more consumption space for both parties as well… In the next 6 months let’s try and not do a high bar and try and do lots of things. Let’s take it one step at a time." The Black Business Council wants this deal to yield results within five months. Singapore’s manufacturing sector suffered due to digital and robotic disruptors, but the federation believes the co-operation with South Africa is just the right medicine needed for both countries to grow.  eNCA

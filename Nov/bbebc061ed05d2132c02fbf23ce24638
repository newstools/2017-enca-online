JOHANNESBURG - As Tiger Woods prepares to make a competitive return to golf since his latest back surgery on Thursday at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, veteran SA golfer Ernie Els has urged the golfing public and the 79-time PGA tour winner to exercise patience. READ: Go easy Tiger, Day urges ahead of comeback The Big Easy finished inside the top-6 in six of the 14 Majors Woods won, including runner-up on two occasions.  “You get the sense he really wants to get back to old Tour life, week in and week out,” the 48-year-old Els said. Woods won five times in 2013 on the PGA tour, but since then he’s made just 19 starts. Woods, now 41, has gone through four surgeries in the last three years and has not played in the USA since the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open in January.

I know he wants to come with an attitude of I want to win and compete but I think a top 30, making a cut, getting comfortable are all good early goals in this case. You can work yourself up from there. “The public should also look at it that way. It is certainly going to be great to see him back in the arena and just take it for that and worry about the rest down the road. Let it just start flowing. “Let him get comfortable out there again. Things have changed out here and let’s see how he adapts his game to the new body.” African News Agency

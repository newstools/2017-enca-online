CAPE TOWN – Residents of Cape Town have bought themselves extra time in their bid to make sure that the city’s taps don’t run dry. Cape Town is currently in the grips of the worst drought in decades. The city is currently implementing level five water restrictions and residents are allocated 87 liters per person for a household of four. Water restrictors are also being installed at houses where the daily allowance is exceeded.

Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille, has warned that it is no reason to relax water-saving measures. De Lille, who has applauded Capetonians who have been saving water, says several projects are in place to ensure residents don't experience water cuts. "Those seven projects as you know, is Monwabisi Beach for desalination, Strandfontein, the V&A Waterfront and also the Cape Town Harbour,” she said. “For water aquifers, we are bringing additional water on from the Atlantis Aquifer and also from the Cape Flats Aquifer."

"If our dams levels go below 13.5 percent, that is the day when the city will turn off the taps or that is the day when there will be no water in the taps," De Lille said. Come Day Zero, residents will be forced to get their daily water supply from collection points but Cape Town's 200 plus informal settlements will be spared, though. eNCA

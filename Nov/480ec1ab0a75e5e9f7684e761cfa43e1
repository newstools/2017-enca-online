MONTE CARLO - Beauden Barrett and Portia Woodman were named World Rugby Men’s and Women’s Player of the Year 2017 at the World Rugby Awards in Monte Carlo on Sunday. On a night to remember in the presence of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco and greats of the game past and present, the rugby family celebrated some outstanding achievers. Barrett becomes only the second player to win the prestigious award two years in a row, matching the achievement of his former All Blacks captain Richie McCaw from 2009-10.

Barrett said, “I’m very proud and surprised. I wanted to be better than last year and I still think I have plenty more to go. The Lions series put us under the most pressure I have probably felt in a black jersey and that’s a credit to the Lions. “We learnt a lot from that series, particularly taking that into the World Cup. When I hang the boots up, that’s when I can look back and be really proud of this. I’ve got to thank my team. I am just one player among a great team.” New Zealand winger Portia Woodman was named the World Rugby Women’s Player of the Year 2017 after helping the Black Ferns win a fifth Women’s Rugby World Cup title in Ireland in August. She received the award ahead of four other nominees in Black Ferns team-mate Kelly Brazier, England winger Lydia Thompson and France back-row duo Romane Menager and Safi N’Diaye.

PARYS, Free State - As the contentious African National Congress (ANC) Free State Provincial General Council (PGC) kicked off on Tuesday evening, the party's deputy secretary general, Jessie Duarte called for unity.  She said the power to elect the ruling party's leader is in the hands of the branches.  According to Duarte, the party has been "meticulous" in resolving disputes raised by branches and individual members and "no one was left hanging." Some supporters of presidential hopeful, Cyril Ramaphosa boycotted the Free State PEC, calling it a sham. ANC Free State chairman, Ace Magashule's term in office ended earlier this year and disgruntled members are therefore disputing the legitimacy of his leadership in the province.

Meanwhile, the South African Communist Party (SACP) will be contesting by-elections in the Free State independently on Wednesday. Last week, President Jacob Zuma visited the Free State in a bid to address problems in the tripartite alliance and admitted the ANC had failed in this regard.  Duarte also referred to this rift on Tuesday evening, saying all that remained to be done was to canvas at ground-level for votes for the ANC.  eNCA

The ANC in Gauteng looks set to officially nominate Ramaphosa as its candidate for party leader when the province holds its provincial general council next weekend. Ramaphosa’s rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has performed poorly in the province, getting less than 60 branch nominations, with the process near completion. Despite hard campaigning, the other presidential hopefuls have failed to perform, with only two branches not nominating the two front-runners.  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Two miners have been killed at AngloGold Ashanti's Mponeng Mine in Carletonville. Rescue operations are under way as two other workers remain trapped underground. Mine spokesperson Chris Nthite says a seismic event led to a rock collapse. This is third such incident at the Mponeng Mine in just over a month. Two miners were killed there a couple of weeks ago. eNCA

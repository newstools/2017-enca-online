JOHANNESBURG - Former estate agent Vicki Momberg has been found guilty on all four counts crimen injuria. Momberg gained notoriety after a video showing her hurling racist abuse at a black police officer went viral on social media in February 2016. The officer was trying to assist her after she was involved in an alleged smash-and-grab incident.  Magistrate Pravina Raghoonandan said Vicki Momberg intended to humiliate the complainant and impaired dignity. Raghoonandan said also said Momberg’s choice of words were racial and that the “k-word” is the most notorious word in South Africa and its use constitutes hate crime. Momberg has been released on a warning and is due back in court on November 30. #VickiMomberg has been released on warning, she will be back in court on Nov. 30.

It was revealed she had a psychological condition at the time of her outburst but had the ability to differentiate between right and wrong. Momberg offered a temporary insanity defence during her testimony. In June, the Equality Court ordered Momberg to pay R100,000 in damages to the officer she racially abused, Constable Clement Mkhondo. eNCA

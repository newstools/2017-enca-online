Earlier, Henri Van Breda's lawyer, Piet Botha, had re-examined his client's testimony. State prosecutor Susan Galloway had finished her cross-examination of Van Breda, who she accused of having selective memory loss about the incident in which his family were murdered. Van Breda denied the accusation. He has pleaded not guilty to killing his parents and brother and accuses an intruder of the attack. His sister Marli survived the attack but suffers from memory loss.  eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - PPC nearly tripled attributable net profit in the six months to September, to R294-million from R102m in the same period in 2016. A “strong performance” from its assets in the rest of Africa boosted its regional earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) by 25 percent as group ebitda grew 4 percent to R1.2-billion. The results bode well for a potential bidding war that now favours PPC shareholders. The group this week effectively rejected a joint conditional partial offer by South African cement producer AfriSam and Canada’s Fairfax insurance group, saying it significantly undervalued PPC. Headline earnings per share shot up 36 percent in the latest interim period, with net cash flow from operating activities leaping 49 percent to R870-million. Group finance costs plunged 44 percent to R285-million as net debt declined from R4.7-billion in March to R4.4-billion. Meanwhile, the group has received non-binding expressions of interest from Irish cement giant CRH and LafargeHolcim. The latter already has cement assets in South Africa. CRH has indicated it is considering an all-cash proposal for a controlling stake in PPC.

Group capital expenditure was much lower than previously due to the company’s new cement operations in Rwanda, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zimbabwe ramping up, he said. Meyrick Barker, investment analyst at Kagiso Asset Management, said that the key profit driver in the interim period was the non-recurrence of fees incurred on recapitalising the balance sheet in the previous year. “Stripping out the impact of specific one-off costs relating to [broad-based black economic empowerment] charges and ongoing corporate action, the increase of 9 percent in ebitda is a better reflection of operational performance,” he said. South African volumes, however, remained under pressure across PPC’s cement, lime and aggregates business. Having suffered years of pricing pressure, the South African cement industry had been able to achieve inflation related price increases over the past 12 months, Barker said. The Congo operation’s ability to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations in a weak economy with a cement oversupply was a concern. iNet Bridge

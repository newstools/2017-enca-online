JOHANNESBURG – South African gymnast, Bianca Zoonekynd made history recently at the Trampoline World Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria by becoming the first female South African champion.

According to Zoonekynd’s publicist, Samantha Strydom, “In a stunning turn of events, Bianca has shown South Africa and the world that courage and determination are all you need to follow your dreams.” “No one could believe that this humble athlete had pulled off the impossible by winning gold.”  Zoonekynd’s achievement is a classic comeback tale after a car crash three months ago saw her end up in hospital with broken ribs and a punctured lung, in her hometown of Port Elizabeth. When asked what her plans are for the future, Zoonekynd said she wants to generate more funding for tumbling and trampoline gymnastics at her home gym, Mandys Tumbling and Trampoline Gymnastics school in PE, to enable more kids from previously disadvantaged communities the opportunity to train and compete at these international events.  The gold medalist will be back in SA on Wednesday 14 November. eNCA

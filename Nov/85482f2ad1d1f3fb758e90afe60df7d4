CAPE TOWN – State capture has been cast into the limelight as the MP’s debate the ongoing issues that have dogged President Jacob Zuma, who is the central figure in the allegations.

	The ANC MP asks if Steenhuisen is equipped to answer a question on how he departed the KZN legislature.

He adds that the matter is private and that people who are “interested in what’s going on in other peoples bedrooms have very little going on in their own." ANC MP, Lusizo Makhubela-Mashele points out that, "Our primary role as MPs in the national assembly is to ensure that proper accountability and governance of all state organs occur.” The debate was requested by the DA to give a chance to the MP’s to address the issue of state capture in the National Assembly. This debate is seen as a parliamentary duty to hold President Zuma and other executives accountable for violating the Ethics Code by not inspecting Gupta links and ignoring the recommendations made by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. eNCA

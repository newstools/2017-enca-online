PARLIAMENT - President Jacob Zuma spoke in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on Thursday afternoon.  Zuma: We have a responsibility to promote unity and social cohesion. It's of serious concern that some people who marched against farm murders displayed symbols of racism and the past. This means some yearn for the past. #ZumaNCop Delivering the OR Tambo Memorial Lecture in Kagiso, Gauteng, over the weekend, the president painted anyone opposed to nuclear energy in South Africa as having sold out to Western interests who've blocked these plans since the dawn of democracy. READ: Those opposed to nuclear sold out to the West: Zuma According to Zuma, "When we came back to start negotiating, the western countries said we have nuclear weapons and that we should destroy them because the communists aren't supposed to have that power. So do you understand where the nuclear issue comes from? They should not have the nuclear because they are communists. Destroy all the bombs so they don't learn how to use nuclear." It was the OR Tambo Memorial Lecture, but the late leader’s name was mentioned only once. Zuma chose, instead, to give a summary of the political balance of forces and set the scene for a mammoth battle as the ANC hurtles toward its critical elective conference in December. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Health Department has condemned the conduct of a nurse, who was filmed verbally abusing a patient. The video went viral on social media. In it, a nurse from St Mary’s Hospital in Pinetown rudely tells the patient to sit up and asks the ill woman how long she intends wearing adult diapers. The patient later died. In a statement, the Department says the video shows the nurse addressing the patient "in a manner that does not convey empathy. The nurse also appears to be changing the patient’s nappy without drawing the bedside curtains to maintain the privacy of the patient. Such conduct is contrary to the Batho Pele principles and Codes Governing Health Care Professionals." The department is investigating the matter and says disciplinary steps are being taken.  eNCA

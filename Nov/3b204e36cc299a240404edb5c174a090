JOHANNESBURG - Social media users have taken note of the newly-released report by the commission of inquiry into the feasibility of making higher education free in South Africa, and are not impressed by the recommendations made. EXPLAINED: What the fees commission recommended The #Feesmustfall campaign was largely driven by social media and saw a number of South African universities brought to its knees as students demanded free education.  The commission recommended that all undergraduate and postgraduate students studying at both public and private universities and colleges, regardless of their family background, be funded through a cost-sharing model of government guaranteed income-contingency loans sourced from commercial banks. eNCA

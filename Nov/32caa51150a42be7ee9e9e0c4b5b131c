PRETORIA - A new initiative has been launched that aims to create more than a million jobs in the manufacturing sector over the next decade. Since 1989, the sector has shed half a million jobs with manufacturing's contribution to GDP dropping from 24 percent to less than 13 percent in 2017. The Map to a Million project by the Manufacturing Circle proposes a manufacturing working group be established among business, labour and government to increase job creation in the sector. Key elements to boost employment in the industry is to increase domestic demand, substitute imports and enhance export competitiveness. "We should look at where can we rather produce locally rather than import and (how) to become more competitive with our export ability. There are certain structural issues where we can quite easily reduce our port tariffs for example which are 88 percent higher than the global average. It will put us in a position where we can drive demand," said the chairman of Manufacturing Circle, Andre de Ruyter.

And, the relationship between business and government must improve, as Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies indicated. "There is a very serious set of issues that we’ll be grappling with now to ensure that there is a stronger enforcement and greater consequence management for the localisation decisions that we have taken as government, to ensure that those are carried through when procurement decisions are made by public entities," the minister said. The government said while public interventions are important, the private sector too, needs to do more.  eNCA

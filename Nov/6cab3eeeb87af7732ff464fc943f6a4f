CAPE TOWN - The murder trial of triple murder-accused Henri van Breda continues on Tuesday. On Monday, a neurologist confirmed that Van Breda has seizures. Dr James Butler testified in the Western Cape High Court on Monday that a seizure could be followed by a “postictal state” which is an altered state of consciousness characterised by disorienting symptoms such as confusion and drowsiness. Butler said there’s compelling evidence to show that Van Breda suffered a seizure shortly after his family was attacked. He also told the court that the lack of urgency in Van Breda’s voice when he made the call to emergency services could have been because he was in a postictal state. Butler said Van Breda has a “generalised form of epilepsy” and there would, therefore, have been no warning that he was about to have a seizure on the night his family was attacked in January 2015. WATCH: Experts testify in Van Breda murder trial “The abruptness of the onset of amnesia is highly significant. The only culprit left standing is epilepsy”. Electrodes recording the brain’s electrical activity for 24 hours and heart monitors were attached to Van Breda. Spikes appearing on the EEG were strongly predictive of epilepsy, Butler told the court. Butler believes Van Breda has had epilepsy for several years, and when questioned about the severity of the seizures by Judge Siraj Desai, conceded that it doesn’t impair one’s daily functioning. Van Breda has pleaded not guilty to killing his mother, father and brother at their upmarket De Zalze Estate in Stellenbosch in 2015. - Additional reporting ANA  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – The Leonid meteor shower will be visible as the world crosses the orbital path of Comet Tempel-Tuttle. The event happens annually around 17 and 18 November. Like many comets, Tempel-Tuttle litters its orbit with bits of debris. It is when this cometary debris enters Earth’s atmosphere and vaporises that we see the Leonid meteor shower. In 2017, the peak night of the shower is expected from midnight to dawn on Friday and Saturday mornings. Although this shower is known for its periodic storms, no Leonid storm is expected this year. Around 115 streaks per hour will be visible when the showers peak in the early hours of 17 November. The best place to watch a meteor shower is always in the countryside, away from city lights. The meteors will appear in all parts of the sky. (Source: http://earthsky.org) eNCA

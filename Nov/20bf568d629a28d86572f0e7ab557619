South African Premiership leaders Baroka scored one minute from time to grab a 2-2 draw with Platinum Stars Sunday in a top-versus-bottom clash that did not go according to expectations. Platinum led twice in northern city Polokwane with a goal from Malawi star Robert Ng'ambi three minutes from time seemingly setting the visitors up for only a second league win in 12 outings. But another Malawian, Robin Ngalande, pounced on a loose ball just outside the box and struck a sweet looping half-volley into the net to earn Baroka a point. While Baroka remains at the summit, Platinum vacated bottom place thanks to the draw, moving above defending champions Wits on goal difference. Lehlohonolo Masalesa gave Platinum a 1-0 half-time advantage that was cancelled by substitute Mpho Kgaswane on 58 minutes.  Orlando Pirates ground out a 1-0 win at Bloemfontein Celtic through a close-range poke from Musa Nyatama to rise six places to second, one point below the leaders. One-time Celtic midfielder Nyatama followed an international football practice of not celebrating a goal scored against a former club. The hard-earned victory was particularly sweet as the Soweto Buccaneers last won in central city Bloemfontein nine years ago. Baroka have 19 points after 12 rounds, Pirates 18, Golden Arrows and Cape Town City 17, and Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs, Chippa United and Celtic 16.  With just three points separating the top eight clubs, this is the most hotly contested Premiership title race since its 1996 formation. CAF Confederation Cup runners-up SuperSport United are also potential title contenders provided they successfully overcome a fixture backlog caused by African commitments. Wits occupying the last place is a shock as they went on a pre-season buying spree with former Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar and Egypt striker Amr Gamal among the additions. AFP

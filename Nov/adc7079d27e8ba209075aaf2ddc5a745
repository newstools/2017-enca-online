As far as the board appointments I report to cabinet, and cabinet decides who serves on the boards," she said. The minister was responding to allegations made by Tsotsi at the Eskom inquiry on November 22. Among these were that Tony Gupta threatened to fire Tsotsi during a meeting. He also revealed how the Guptas influenced the appointment of board members at the parastatal. eNCA

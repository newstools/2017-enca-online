JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) is hosting a briefing on Wednesday to provide updates on its readiness for the upcoming December elective conference.  Three key ANC branches in KwaZulu-Natal have missed the party’s deadline to nominate a new leadership. Two of them apparently support presidential hopeful, Cyril Ramaphosa, while the third branch remains hotly contested. The ANC has set up a panel to investigate violence at its Eastern Cape's provincial conference in August. Four NEC members will make up the panel, namely Sbu Ndebele (chairperson), Rejoice Mabudafhasi, Joyce Moloi-Moropa, and Sdumo Dlamini. eNCA

BEIJING - Panama and China agreed on Friday to study the possibility of reaching a free trade agreement after the Central American nation ditched Taiwan and recognised Beijing. The memorandum of understanding was among 19 cooperation agreements signed by the two countries as Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing. The two nations also reached agreements related to agriculture, civil aviation and maritime transport, as well as tourism to facilitate visits by Chinese tour groups to Panama.

JOHANNESBURG – World Youth High Jump champion, Breyton Poole, delivered another fine performance in Cape Town on Saturday, equalling the national record in his age group. Competing at the Western Province Athletics Open Meeting at Green Point Stadium, Poole sailed over the bar at 2.25m. He added one centimetre to the personal best he set in Nairobi in July when he won gold at the World Under-18 Championships. His performance also matched the long-standing South African youth record set by Jacques Freitag in Tshwane in July 1999. Like Poole, Freitag had also won the world youth title and went on to bag the global junior and senior crowns. “Well done to Breyton on another fantastic achievement,” said Athletics South Africa president, Aleck Skhosana. “Congratulations also to his coach and support team on nurturing this young talent. He is a bright prospect for the future and we hope he grows from strength to strength.”  African News Agency

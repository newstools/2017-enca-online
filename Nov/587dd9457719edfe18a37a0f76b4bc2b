TRANSKEI – Several Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) mineworkers have gone into hiding in the Eastern Cape, saying they're fearing for their lives. The miners from Lonmin claim they're being targeted for their anti-corruption stance in the union. The mountains of Transkei area have a long history of supplying manual labour to Gauteng mines. Lately, the green mountains and their forests are becoming a hiding spot for several miners. "We live in complete fear, whether we are here at our homes or back at work in Joburg. We always watch our backs because we are targeted to be killed," a miner told eNCA on condition of anonymity READ: Amcu members fear for their lives  This miner says he and several others had no choice, but to run away from Amcu's leaders. "There were threats that we were going to be killed and we decided to resign from our jobs and came back home. Even here in the Eastern Cape, we are not safe. Our comrades are still dying. Two others have already been buried, from Lusikisiki and Libode." This miner says they're facing threats of challenging corruption and demanding an elective conference to replace Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa. He accuses Mathunjwa of avoiding to deal with issues at hand and addressing challenges. He says instead he [Mathunjwa] would rather accuse those who raise issues of being used by the opposition National Union of Mineworkers (NUM.) "He is autocratic,” said the miner.

If he notices that you are a capable and strong leader, he gets intimidated that you could outshine or end up removing him. Everything is centred around him. " Fear is palpable the area, the miners move in groups, and say they're ready to defend themselves. They say hitmen from Johannesburg are looking for them and three of their colleagues are dead. eNCA

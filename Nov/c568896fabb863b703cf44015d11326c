JOHANNESBURG - Nomthandazo Sishi, better known as Nomthi Sishi from Joyous Celebration, grew up in Mlazi, KwaZulu-Natal, close to her siblings and developing a love of music at a young age. Even this Zulu beauty was born with albinism,  she has taken it in her stride. Sishi sang at school and with numerous music ensembles, but her big break was landing a spot in Pastor Jabu Hlongwane’s very popular choir, Joyous Celebration. From there, her career took a sharp turn towards greatness But it didn't come without sacrifices: she was obliged to leave her studies and family behind and relocate to the City of Gold, Johannesburg. Sishi spoke to eNCA’s Mbali Langa about music, life, growing up with albinism and how she is realising her dreams, one gospel song at a time. Click on the video above for the full interview. eNCA

Mbvalula recently released the latest crime statistics and focused heavily on police leadership.  He stated that bringing down crime in South Africa was in the national interest irrespective of political affiliation and "violent criminals will receive a proportional response to what they dish out." "The environment we are in requires leadership … in order for us to succeed", said Mbalula. Mbalula noted that alcohol abuse was a factor in the overwhelming number of crimes. He said that crime levels needed to drop significantly. "We have a 1.8% drop in crime. I do not feel it and our people do not feel it," he said. "Our station level must ensure that we are felt in the different communities." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - It's that time of the year when men grow their moustaches in a bid to create awareness around men's health. One of the country's top drifting champions is revving up support for this global movement that focuses on prostate and testicular cancer, among other health issues affecting men. A two-times National Drift Champion known for burning up the tar, SA's Jason Webb is signing up to be a "Mo Bro." Webb is an ambassador for this year's Movember Foundation campaign. And he's in top gear to support the message to "Grow a mow to save a bro." You can watch the video package about Webb in the multimedia box above.  eNCA

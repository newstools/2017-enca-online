JOHANNESBURG - A Stanlib economist says South Africa may narrowly escape a credit rating downgrade on Friday. Two ratings agencies, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, are preparing to release their ratings review. A downgrade could spell disaster for the economy, leading to an outflow of billions of rands. It also threatens the value of bonds sold by government and corporations.

He said the agencies have two options. "The ratings agency could come out and put us on rating watch, which will imply that within 90 days they’ll have to come up with an announcement. "The other option is that they keep the ratings unchanged and that they wait until we have the outcome of the political transition and even (then) they might postpone it to beyond the budget next year. "We must be cognisant that most of the downgrades given to SA was only given mid-year this year which means it’s too quick to downgrade us again unless we’ve done really bad in terms of deliverables." eNCA

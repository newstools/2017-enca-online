The President returns to the NCOP just in a space of a week. Earlier in November he was in the National Assembly fielding questions. Among other questions to be asked are: What are the reasons of his 11th cabinet reshuffle? Whether he intends to make representations to the NPA on the alleged 783 charges of corruption, fraud and recketeering before the deadline of November 30? eNCA

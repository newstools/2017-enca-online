JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma says it would be irrational and unconstitutional to suspend NPA head Shaun Abrahams based on a Supreme Court of Appeal judgment.
	
	Zuma was responding to a written parliamentary question from Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota. READ: NPA not embarrassed by 'spy tapes' concession Lekota asked if he was reviewing Abrahams' fitness to hold office. The Cope leader asked if the manner in which Abrahams justified the decision taken to drop corruption charges against Zuma last month warranted a suspension. Zuma says there's nothing in the SCA's judgment that suggests Abrahams isn’t fit to be the head of the NPA. eNCA

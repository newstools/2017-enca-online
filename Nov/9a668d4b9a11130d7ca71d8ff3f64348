JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi said he was pleased that the majority of learners arrived in time to write their exams on Wednesday. This was despite a march by members of the National Taxi Alliance to the Union Buildings. READ: Pupils affected by #BlackMonday allowed to write exams “Our preliminary report indicates that less than 20 learners were redirected to alternative venues to write their exam. It is important to note that, most learners who arrived late were not more than an hour late. A handful of learners that were an hour late, were accommodated accordingly. No absenteeism has been reported due to the said strike,” Lesufi said in a statement. “We would like to thank all parents who made an effort to make alternative transport arrangements especially for our Grade 12 learners,” he added. eNCA

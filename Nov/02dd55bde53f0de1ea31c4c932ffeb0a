PARIS - Three-time European champions Toulon's struggles continued in the Top 14 as they lost 20-19 at Castres on Saturday. Toulon scored three tries to two from the home team, but only kicked four points, while Benjamin Urdapilleta struck two penalties and two conversions for Castres. Julien Caminati gave the home team the lead with a third-minute try before Chris Ashton and Ma'a Nonu quickly replied. Toulon led by two at halftime. They led 19-13 after a try by Malakai Fekitoa in the 57th minute but Emerick Setiano, a prop who had just come off the bench, received a yellow card in the 59th minute. Six minutes later, Castres won a penalty try after a Toulon collapsed a maul. Urdapilleta converted to put the home team one point ahead. It was a fourth straight victory for Castres who climbed to fourth in the table and a third consecutive league defeat for Toulon. "I do not think the confidence of the squad has been dented. Its a united group," said Fabrice Landreau, the Toulon coach. "Even so, we must still start winning points." Later on Saturday, champions Clermont visit last-place Oyonnax aiming for their first away success of the season. On Sunday, leaders Montpellier face a test of their title credentials against 2016 champions Racing 92. AFP

Dube said disaster management centres were on high alert in all areas of KwaZulu-Natal expected to be affected. "However, the first line of defence is the people and their conduct in such life-threatening conditions. We urge people to minimise their movement. " People living in low-lying areas are urged to take note of potential flooding and mudslides.  Road users should not take unnecessary risks and are urged to be extra careful as they undertake their journeys. "No one should attempt to cross low-lying bridges during flooding. We urge Citizens to take this warning seriously as it might prove to be the difference between life and death," Dube said. eNCA

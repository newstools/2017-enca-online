SHANGHAI, China - Brazilian star Kaka is in talks with Guizhou Hengfeng Zhicheng about prolonging his career with a move to the Chinese Super League (CSL) side, reports say. The 35-year-old former Real Madrid and AC Milan attacking midfielder is a free agent after leaving Orlando City in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States in October. The World Cup winner was linked with a move to the boardroom of AC Milan, where he is a popular figure since his playing days.

Guizhou City News said that no contract had yet been signed, but said that Kaka and the club "had a good conversation". The Chinese Football Association earlier this year imposed a 100 percent tax on the transfer fees of foreign imports, but Kaka would be available on a free transfer, albeit on hefty wages. AFP

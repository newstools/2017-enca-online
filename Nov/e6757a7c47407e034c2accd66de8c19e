CAPE TOWN - The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Western Cape on Thursday condemned the arrest of eight activists who had occupied the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) offices in Cape Town on Wednesday. WATCH: This is war, SACP says Provincial Secretary of the SACP Benson Ngqentsu, Zachie Achmat and six other activists of #UniteBehind were arrested following a demonstration at the NPA offices, demanding that President Jacob Zuma be arrested. “The SACP and the #UniteBehind consciously and correctly demanded the immediate arrest of President Jacob Zuma and his parasitic Gupta network for looting and plunging the state-owned companies and the fiscus into crisis,” said the SACP. At the time of writing, the activists were at the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court for bail proceedings. African News Agency

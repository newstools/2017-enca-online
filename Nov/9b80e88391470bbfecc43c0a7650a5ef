The party’s Provincial General Council is under way with ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe in attendance. He said the party wants to ensure that the will of all branches is respected. “If you sell the ANC now, you are going to sit with that crisis for the next five years. Now, that R4,000 that was offered will haunt you for five years. That I sold the ANC at a conference in Nasrec,” Mantashe said. eNCA

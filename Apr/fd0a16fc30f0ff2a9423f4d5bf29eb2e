SYDNEY Mass coral bleaching on Australia's Great Barrier Reef could cost the region more than a million tourists a year and up to Aus$1-billion (R10,32bn) in lost revenue, a study warned on Wednesday.Scientists said this week that coral bleached for two consecutive years at the World Heritage-listed site had "zero prospect" of recovery after researchers detected another round of mass bleaching due to warming sea temperatures.In a new study, Australia's independent Climate Council said that further damage to the 2,300km long reef could severely affect tourism prospects and cost around 10,000 jobs."This isn't just an environmental issue. The Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia's greatest economic assets," said the council's Lesley Hughes."It's responsible for bringing in more than Aus$7bn each year to our economy, while also supporting the livelihoods of around 70,000 people."

Coral reefs can absorb 97% of the wave energy delivered to coastlines.

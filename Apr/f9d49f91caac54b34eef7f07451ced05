LOS ANGELES A judge in California denied on Monday a renewed request from film director Roman Polanski to be sentenced in absentia in connection with a 1970s case in which he was convicted of the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl.The Polish director fled to Europe in 1978 before his sentencing in the case and has refused to return to the US since. In December, Poland s Supreme Court upheld a lower court s decision to block his extradition. There is no sufficient or compelling basis for reconsideration of these issues, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Scott M Gordon wrote on Monday, in an order posted online by the Los Angeles Times.The same court already had denied a similar request for sentencing in absentia in 2010, Gordon wrote.Polanski also asked in 2008 for the case to be dismissed.African News Agency

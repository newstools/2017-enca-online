CAPE TOWN - South African cruiserweight Kevin Lerena, who enjoys world top-10 rankings by the WBC, IFB and WBO, hardly looked the part as he laboured to a unanimous points decision over Mexico s Sergio Ramirez in Johannesburg on Sunday.Ready for the best & higher honours --Thanks to my promoter Golden gloves we got the shot at the IBO world title --#TeamSmith #StrapSeason pic.twitter.com/kleYSluQGeThe judges scored the eight-rounder 79-73 (twice) and 78-74.After a slowish start, there was enough to suggest from round three onwards that Lerena was headed for an early stoppage but the Mexican spoiler absorbed punishment right to the end.The fight was arranged by Golden Gloves to keep their cruiserweight contender busy after failing recently to secure passage to the USA for high-profile bouts in an effort to steer him to world title contention.IBO title shot for @Kevin_Ko_Lerena: https://t.co/UOnqOLAw6A pic.twitter.com/Hu4iTe24lGHowever, despite doing enough to shade his opponent in almost every round, Lerena could not summon sufficient power to hurt the tough Mexican who weathered a number of sporadic barrages.Lerena, the reigning South African cruiserweight champion, improved his pro fight record to 18 (9) -1.Ramirez, from Tijuana, Mexico, now has 14 wins (7 KO) and three defeats after this bout.

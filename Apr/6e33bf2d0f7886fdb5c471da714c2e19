JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance wants the interim SABC board to fire Hlaudi Motsoeneng.The party says Motsoeneng breached the SABC's code of conduct when he hosted a media briefing on Wednesday.Despite a court order that he can't hold a position at the public broadcaster, Motsoeneng is still an employee, earning 350-thousand rand a month, pending disciplinary proceedings.The DA says Motsoeneng hosted the media briefing without permission from the SABC's board, or management.And this, the party says, is a deliberate attempt to cause negative reporting of the SABC in other media.The action is listed in the SABC s rule book as grounds for dismissal.READ: 'Hands off Hlaudi' - Motsoeneng supporters make their voices heardMeanwhile, government has criticised Motsoeneng for questioning the legality of SABC s interim board.Motsoeneng told journalists that the board members had not been screened as required by law.He also questioned the re-appointment of former board member Krish Naidoo.Motsoeneng said Naidoo lied under oath during the parliamentary ad hoc committee proceedings.Government insists the five-member board is legally constituted, and has six months to turn the public broadcaster around.WATCH: The ad hoc committee has caused havoc, says MotsoenengeNCA

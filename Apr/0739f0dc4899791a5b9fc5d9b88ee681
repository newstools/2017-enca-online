CAPE TOWN Two-time defending champion Caroline W stmann pulled out of the 56km Two Oceans ultra-marathon in the early stages of the race on Saturday.Just after the 11km mark, W stmann decided she could no longer bear the discomfort of an injured hamstring and ended her chances of a hat-trick of victories in the race.

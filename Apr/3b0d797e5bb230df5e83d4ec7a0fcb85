JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs kept their league title hopes alive and stretched their unbeaten run to 12 matches, as they outplayed a spirited Bloemfontein Celtic 2-0 in an Absa Premiership match played at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein on Wednesday evening.Chiefs, who went into the match with 6 wins and 4 draws from their last 10 league outings, seem to have settled well into coach Steve Khompela s playing pattern of 3 (defenders) 4 (midfielders) 2 (wingers) 1 (striker), and dominated all phases of play, against a Celtic side that was unbeaten in its last 3 league and 2 Nedbank Cup outings.Congratulations to Absa Man of the Match: @GeorgeMaluleka #AbsaPrem #BestTeam4Life pic.twitter.com/9sdWUfSAQeWith the hosts playing like men possessed in an attempt to see Celtic move away from the relegation struggle, Chiefs used patience and skill, before finding the necessary space to raid deep in attacks, and some clever play by winger Joseph Molangoane played George Maluleka through to score in the 12th minute of the match.READ: Chiefs unveil new strikerChiefs Venezuelan signing Gustavo Paez, who got the two goals in the Amakhosi s 2-1 win over ABC Motsepe League (Mpumalanga) side Acornbush in Nedbank Cup Last 16 round action at the weekend, made his appearance as a second-half substitute in place of Zimbabwean striker Edmore Chirambodare, and scored the visitors second goal from a quickly taken free-kick in the 68th minute. #BestTeam4Life! pic.twitter.com/QCySNG7iAaMolangoane the former Chippa United midfielder, was a constant thorn in the flesh of the Celtic team, in contributing several attacking opportunities.The Soweto giants always seemed to be one step ahead in thinking, speed and strength, and Celtic s chances on attacking the goal protected by Bafana Bafana No 1 Itumeleng Khune were few and far between.Their best chance came in the 25th minute, when midfielder Musa Nyatama, the club s leading goal-scorer on a mere 3 goals, forced Khune to dive and tip a long-range shot over the Amakhosi s crossbar.

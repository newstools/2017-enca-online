KINSHASA - The deportation of thousands of Congolese nationals from neighbouring Angola ahead of elections was fuelling insecurity in the Democratic Republic of Congo s volatile Kasai region.It has eventually worsened the turbulence that is affecting about two million people in the Central African country.Since the beginning of the year, more than 4,500 immigrants from DRC have been expelled from Angola.Most years, Kasai receives Congolese nationals expelled from Angola for numerous reasons, notably for illegally working in Angola s mining sector.This year, their expulsion has coincided with the skirmishes in Kasai as militia opposed to President Joseph Kabila s continued stay in power clash with the armed forces.READ: Kabila promises to restore security to restive centreThe United Nations Officer for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this year s phenomenon is could be accentuated in the context of Angola s legislative elections set for August. Congolese citizens are drawn to Angola for economic reasons; but this year, some might be pushed across the border for security reasons, and face the need for a safe corridor, the UN said.UN said worsening the frustrations of the Congolese expelled from Angola, a high number were violated during the deportation process.READ: UN Security Council to meet on alleged Syria chemical attackMeanwhile, the complex emergency in the Kasai region is affecting about 2 million people across five provinces.Central Kasai, Eastern Kasai, Kasai, Lomami and Sankuru are worst affected.Violent and daily clashes pitting militia and national security forces have claimed at least 400 lives and forced some 637 000 people to flee their homes since August 2016.Some internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been able to return home but about 434,000 people presently remain displaced, half of them in Kasai.The ongoing violence is also exacerbating tensions between communities identified as supportive of the militia and those perceived siding with government. These tensions have been an additional source of internal displacement, said Dr Mamadou Diallo, UN humanitarian coordinator in the DRC.AFP

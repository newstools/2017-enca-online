SAFCEI's Liz McDaid said, This court case revolved around whether lawful procedures were followed and those laws are not there just for show."That is to make sure that R1-trillion, if we re going to spend that, then everybody in South Africa needs to know what its going to be spent on and whether we really need it. We can t just enter into agreements that are binding, where we take all the risks and the other country walks scot free if anything goes wrong ."Parliament now has to step up. If the goverment wants to push through any other deals, they have to come through Parliament and be done properly. Any idea that we might go nuclear is off the table right now." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt will be pulling his hair out at the number of chances that his charges missed, as they played to a goalless draw against Egyptian side Smouha, in a CAF Confederation Cup Last 32 Qualifying Round first leg match played at the Bidvest Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday afternoon. Bidvest Wits were held to a 0-0 draw by Egyptian side Smouha in the African Confederation Cup. #KickOff https://t.co/yym1trWEaM The stalemate result, in a week which saw the Clever Boys eliminated 2-1 from the Nedbank Cup by National First Division side Jomo Cosmos, has left Wits with the difficult task of seeing off the Egyptian challenge in the return leg fixture, at the Borg El Arab Stadium next Saturday.Having been eliminated from the CAF Champions League by African giants Al Ahly (1-0 on aggregate), the 2015/2016 Absa Premiership runners up, were definitely the better side against Smouha, who are currently in fourth place in their domestic league.The host s leading goalscorer, Malawian Gabadinho Mhango, had the best opportunities to score, but put two efforts well over the Smouha crossbar, as well as missing with a header from a cross by Elias Pelembe in the 32nd minute.Midfielder Vincent Pule too, will feel that he should have headed home in the 75th minute. Right-footed midfielder Ben Motshwari was another player who put in a high work-rate, but who fluffed an opportunity wide of the target.At the other end of the park, Wits goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs had a relatively quiet afternoon. The visitors, fresh from a 2-0 league win over Zamalek, were intent on playing their game plan to perfection, and would have been delighted to leave Johannesburg with a draw. The Egyptians reached the qualifying round by posting a 4-3 aggregate win over Kenya s Ulinzi Stars in the previous round.Coach Hunt can now burn the midnight oil and work on a game plan for the match in Egypt, with Smouha likely to be happy to spend as much time behind the ball as possible.Before boarding the flight to Egypt, Wits, sitting in second spot in the Absa Premiership with 41 points from 20 matches, will host Golden Arrows in league action, on Tuesday nightAfrican News Agency

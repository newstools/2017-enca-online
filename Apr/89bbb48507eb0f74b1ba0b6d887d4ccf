JOHANNESBURG Former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan has lambasted the Presidency s decision to postpone struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada s public memorial service.On Friday, the Presidency announced that it had postponed the official memorial service in Soweto for the late struggle stalwart in the wake of the cabinet reshuffle. #PravinGordhan again calls on South Africans to 'connect the dots'...who's doing what? Who benefits?' #KathradaMemorialThe Gauteng SA Communist Party and Ahmed Kathrada Foundation held a joint memorial service on Saturday afternoon at the Johannesburg City Hall. #PravinGordhan; 'Comrade Kathy leaves us when we're in a mini-crisis. But we know exactly what and who the problems are' #KathradaMemorialREAD: President Zuma has gone 'rogue': HoganGordhan, who was removed from his post as Treasury head by President Jacob Zuma on Thursday night, described the Presidency s decision to cancel the memorial as "petty and spiteful'". Let me say very publicly and openly that postponing the official memorial was petty and spiteful, Gordhan told the packed city hall. Nothing should get in the way of celebrating the lives, contributions and lessons of what many people on this platform have called a golden generation. Nothing should stop you. Pravin Gordhan - #AhmedKathrada leaves us in a crucial time. #KathradaMemorial pic.twitter.com/yxYJUiShbsThe Presidency on Saturday rejected the notion that Zuma had cancelled the memorial service. President Zuma was not involved in the planning of the memorial service and in the cancellation thereof, said spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga. Any impression created that the president cancelled or ordered the cancellation is erroneous and unfortunate. eNCA

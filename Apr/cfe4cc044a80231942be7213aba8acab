"These are very important reports because we are now dealing with mitigation of sentencing," Mthethwa s Lawyer, William Booth said."Mr Mthethwa has been convicted of murder on the basis of dolus eventulis along the lines of what happened in the Oscar Pistorius matter.""There is the potential of heavy sentences, so those have to be dealt with in a proper fashion, so that is why we required time, and the judge granted the postponement and the state didn t oppose it which is a very fair and reasonable request," Booth added.eNCA

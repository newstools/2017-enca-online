I was their second choice for Usual Suspects, fourth choice for America Beauty and 15th choice to host this year s Tony Awards. I think my career is definitely going in the right direction, he said. Maybe I can get shortlisted to host the Oscars if everyone else turns it down. Producers hope Spacey will limit the audience erosion likely from the numbers last year when Hamilton and host James Corden drew 8,73 million viewers, up 35 percent from 2015 and its largest audience since 2001.African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG Bus companies should reimburse commuters stranded without transport as a result of the ongoing bus strike, the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) said on Thursday. These passengers will now be left stranded because of the nationwide strike in the passenger bus sector. Many people who use public transport bought tickets for this week and for the Easter holidays, and were not told that there was a possibility that there would not be transport services because of the strike, the trade union federation said in a statement. The bus companies should not have accepted payment for tickets because they had no reasonable intention of supplying services, and this was foreseeable as they were engaged in tense wage negotiations. The strike, which has entered its second day, has left commuters, especially long distance travellers stranded across the country on the eve of the Easter holidays.READ: Passengers left stranded amid nationwide bus strikeOn Wednesday, the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa), one of the five unions in the sector, announced it has reject a nine percent wage increase offer by employers.Employers offered 7.5 percent, while workers demanded between 12 and 15 percent increases, depending on their union.The Department of Transport should intervene, said Cosatu. We are also restating our call on the Department of Transport to intervene and work to help resolve this strike on behalf of thousands of workers and travellers, who will be affected by the strike over the Good Friday long weekend. This strike will put a strain on the transport system during this busy weekend and if not resolved, we are likely to see an increase in road fatalities. African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG – The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department is searching for 1,500 men and women to undergo training to stand a chance to become metro police officers, the city said on Sunday. “I am searching for men and women who have the highest sense of justice and integrity to join [the] JMPD to serve and protect the residents of Joburg,” mayoral committee member for safety Michael Sun said. This recruitment was the public safety department’s first step under the new administration not only to enhance visible policing but to also create jobs for men and women who might either be unemployed or searching for a meaningful way to contribute to society, he said. “With an additional 1,500 officers deployed in the city we are certain that visible policing will be more tangible and effective in curbing crime.” READ: JMPD out in full force for Easter break Applicant had to be South African citizens living in the jurisdiction of Johannesburg; aged between 18 and 35; in possession of a valid senior certificate (Grade 12 or NQF level 4 equivalent); proficient in English; in possession of a valid code B manual transmission driver’s licence; physically and mentally fit; able to subject themselves to a pre-training fitness test; cleared of and have no criminal record and/or civil judgment relating to fraud and/or corruption; and be prepared to carry a firearm and perform duties in uniform. “We look forward to the brave men and women in the city answering this call of honour and becoming a member of the elite law enforcement of the city,” Sun said.

JOHANNESBURG - Kevin Lerena has long yearned for a title shot. Now he has one as the highly-ranked cruiserweight squares off against Russian hard-man Maxim Maslov (19-1-1) for the IBO crown at Emperors Palace on August 12.Ready for the best & higher honours --Thanks to my promoter Golden gloves we got the shot at the IBO world title --#TeamSmith #StrapSeason pic.twitter.com/kleYSluQGeThe belt recently became vacant when Marco Huck was beaten by Mairis Briedis, who failed to pay the IBO sanction fee, thus forfeiting the belt.Conceding that it was a difficult decision to make given Lerena s high rating in the WBO, promoter Rodney Berman said that this would elevate him internationally in the same way that Hekkie Budler s first run as IBO champion did.The IBO has gained much credibility in recent years with world-class fighters like Gennady Golovkin, Wladimir Klitschko, Manny Pacquiao and Chris Eubank jr all proudly parading IBO belts.IBO title shot for @Kevin_Ko_Lerena: https://t.co/UOnqOLAw6A pic.twitter.com/Hu4iTe24lGThe IBO has also cultivated a strong relationship with SA boxing, in particular, with a number of fighters owning championship crowns. The reality is that this gives Kevin the opportunity to earn a champion s purses, said Berman. He can also build up while defending the belt, assuming he wins against what will be a tough opponent. The plan, of course, is to cash in with a major payday down the line against a big name like Tony Bellew or Oleksandr Usyk.

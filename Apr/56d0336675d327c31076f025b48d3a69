PRETORIA - A magistrate has overturned Tshwane Metro Police's decision to disallow Save South Africa's anti-Zuma march on Friday. Earlier, the march was prohibited due to non-compliance, Section 27's Mark Heywood had said.The organisation then sought an interdict and were granted permission to continue with the march by Pretoria's Chief Magistrate.Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga took to Twitter to dispute the prohibition. Someone trying to cause confusion, has now communicated that Tshwane has denied permission for tomorrow's march. This isn't trueWe haven't denied permission for tomorrow's march. Someone who's ill-disciplined is busy playing politics using their admin position.Heywood said he was informed of the decision hours before civil society groups were due to start their demostrations.SaveSA, Outa, and the Democratic Alliance have all mobilised civilians to stage protest action on Friday, through social media campaigns.Protests have already begun in some parts of the country; SaveSA has been coordinating efforts to occupy Church Square since Tuesday.This is a developing story, more will follow eNCA

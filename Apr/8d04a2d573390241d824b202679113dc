JOHANNESBURG Former chief whip and national executive committee (NEC) member Mathole Motshekga has called for a special NEC meeting amid calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down.Motshekga said the ANC is the body that deploys all its members to positions. Where the ANC feels that some of its deployees are not adequate to the task, it has a right to decide on their deployment. I am saying that the ANC has the opportunity now to consider what is being raised by the people. The ANC NEC is the only competent structure now to consider what society or sections thereof is raising. It will do the ANC no harm to sit down and consider, without fear or favour, the issues that are being raised, he added.WATCH: ANC top brass briefs media on NWC outcomesLast week, the ANC's national working committee reaffirmed its support for Zuma.Motshekga refused to be drawn into the debate on the motion of no-confidence in Zuma brought by opposition parties. I think votes of no confidence, we have had many of them since 2009.They are exercise in futility. What is required now is decisive action by the ANC itself. This matter must be dealt by the ANC, not through Parliament. eNCA

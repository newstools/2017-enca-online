UNTU said that it hoped that Prasa would make an acceptable salary offer to employees.UNTU said it believed a national strike would not be in the best interest of the company, commuters or South Africans.READ: Government studying Prasa court judgment UNTU is a responsible trade union that does not take any form of industrial action lightly. However, our members deserve more than the seven percent salary increase the employer is offering right now, UNTU general secretary Steve Harris said. Furthermore, there will be hell to pay if Prasa continues with its unjustified threats of job losses to follow a seven percent wage increase, after the management of the passenger rail operator admitted to Parliament that they cannot account for R14-billion. Therefore it is no wonder that Prasa has a budget deficit of R1.8-billion. UNTU declared a dispute over wages in February and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), issued a certificate of non-resolution after it could not resolve the dispute. With the certificate, unions can give Prasa a 48-hour notice of its intent to embark on a protected national strike.Harris, however, said that UNTU was consolidating the mandates the union received from its members across the country. The union does not consider embarking on the strike before the upcoming long weekend. African News Agency

Two of those she passed will start on Monday: Valentine Kipketer, who finished fifth last year, and Joyce Chepkirui, who finished third.Caroline Rotich, the 2015 Boston winner, is also in the field, while home hopes rest with Desiree Linden, who finished seventh in the Rio Olympic marathon last year.The race will be the fourth Boston Marathon contested since two pressure-cooker bombs planted near the finish line of the race killed three people and injured 264 others in 2013.Two brothers of Chechen descent, Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev were tracked down by authorities. Tamerlan was killed trying to escape capture while Dzokhar was apprehended and convicted of the attack.AFP

JOHANNESBURG Bidvest Wits have returned to the top of the Absa Premiership log after a comfortable 3-0 win over Golden Arrows at Bidvest Stadium on Tuesday evening.Frank Mhango s penalty and Mogakolodi Ngele s second-half brace took the Clever Boys to a victory which sees them leapfrog Cape Town City to first place on 44 points (having played a game less than the Citizens, who can return to pole position when they play on Thursday).Wits started the match strongly and created early opportunities from set pieces, with Arrows defence even forced to clear off their own goal line after keeper Nkosingiphile Gumede was caught out of position.Just before the midway point of the first half, Wits pressure paid off as they were awarded a penalty for handball by defender Trevor Mathiane (though the referee incorrectly cautioned Limbikani Mzava for the offence).READ: Wits sign former Chiefs defender GaxaFrank Mhango took on the responsibility of the spot kick and easily beat Gumede to make it 1-0 to the Clever Boys, who were soon forced into an unplanned substitution, replacing the injured Thabang Monare with Phumlani Ntshangase.Arrows looked to come back into the game in what remained of the first half, but it was Wits who created another clear scoring chance near the interval, with Sifiso Myeni denied by a fine save from Gumede.The visitors threatened an equaliser in the early moments of the second half as Knox Mutizwa let fly, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced away for a goal kick, much to the Clever Boys relief.After that early scare, Wits ran away with the game in the second half thanks to a brace of goals from Ngele. The Botswana international doubled the lead with a stunning long-range strike on 65 minutes, before making it 3-0 a short while later by turning home Mhango s cross.Wits will head to Egypt this weekend to honour the second leg of their CAF Confederation Cup tie against Smouha SC, while Arrows will be in league action again on Saturday when they host Ajax Cape Town.African News Agency

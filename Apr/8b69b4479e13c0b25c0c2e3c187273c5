The bank says much of the good work it does across the continent, is being ignored."Our contribution is significant - we employ and pay billions in taxes," said ABA Spokesperson, Songezo Zibi."More specifically ... the competition commission [issue] ... it s in the public domain - we cooperated fully because the allegations relate to a very small number of banks."We are determined to root out any unethical behaviour," Zibi said."The competition commission is not seeking a penalty against ABA or Barclays over these allegations." One of the clear conclusion of that investigation which produced 150 page report, which is publicly available was that ABA has no continuing obligation to the assistance of Bankorp and Bankorp was a bank ABA acquired in 1992 and assistance began in 1985, 7 years before our submission to the Public Protector say the exactly same thing, we have also provided documentary evidence to say there is no evidence for ABA to pay, said Zibi.But Cost is not backing down.It insists the bank still needs to honour its obligations, with the state desperately needing funds.eNCA

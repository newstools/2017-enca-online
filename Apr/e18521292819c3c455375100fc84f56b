It also indicates that the external party had access and means to obtain content from the file.Over the past month, the IAAF has consulted the relevant cyber security experts, locally and abroad, and worked with Context to remedy the situation in removing the attackers access to the network.The process was completed over the weekend.Athletes who have applied for TUEs since 2012, have been contacted on Monday and provided with a dedicated email address to contact the IAAF if they have any questions.IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, said: Our first priority is to the athletes, who have provided the IAAF with information that they believed would be secure and confidential. They have our sincerest apologies and our total commitment to continue to do everything in our power to remedy the situation and work with the world s best organisations to create as safe an environment as we can.

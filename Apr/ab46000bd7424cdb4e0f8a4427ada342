It is right that the podium moment should belong to the athletes, but the coach plays such a key role in their success. So we are pleased to be able to support the athlete, to share that success. UK Athletics initially investigated support for the concept, before submitting a formal request to the IAAF for ratification. This was received enthusiastically by the world body, who gave their approval.It is speculated that the coaching medal will be similar in theme to the athlete s medal, but of a different design. Both will be revealed officially in May.READ: Athletes personal information compromised in attack on IAAFJazmin Sawyers, silver medalist in the long jump for England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, endorsed the concept.She said: The coach-athlete relationship is so special and important, so it is fantastic that, at the World Championships in London, coaches are set to be recognised for the efforts they put in to getting an athlete onto the podium.

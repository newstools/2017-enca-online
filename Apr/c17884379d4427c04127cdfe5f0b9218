MONROVIA A heroic display by goalkeeper Ronwen Williams enabled SuperSport United to earn a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Barrack Young Controllers (BYC) in a CAF Confederation Cup match on Sunday. SuperSport coach Stuart Baxter will likely be pleased with the result at the Antonitte Tubman Stadium, the away goal giving his side a good chance of winning the two-legged play-off round tie which will be completed next weekend in Tshwane. There was a frenetic start to Sunday s game with plenty of action in both penalty boxes. And after Williams had made a brilliant save to keep out the hosts on seven minutes, Matsatsatsa shocked the home fans when they took an 11th-minute lead through Fagrie Lakay. It was Thuso Phala who created the goal after beating his man with pace and power before cutting back the cross for Lakay to finish from close range. Lakay had the opportunity to complete his brace shortly after but skied his shot over the bar. That signalled the start of a relentless period of pressure from the Liberia club, which saw Prince Saydee and David Tweh coming close with several attempts. BYC were not to be denied and drew level on 25 minutes through Randy Dukuly. Keagan Ritchie then gave away a 33rd-minute penalty but was a relieved man to see Williams pull off a fantastic save. After the sides came out for the second half in Monrovia, Phala and Aubrey Modiba both had chances for SuperSport but failed to find the net. Williams came to the rescue again when he denied a BYC forward in a one-on-one situation 10 minutes from time as the South Africans held on doggedly for the away draw.African News Agency

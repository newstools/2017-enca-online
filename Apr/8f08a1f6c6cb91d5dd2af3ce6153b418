JOHANNESBURG - ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe reiterated on Wednesday that he and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa did not issue any apology at a meeting of the party s National Working Committee.This was after they had both publicly criticised President Jacob Zuma s Cabinet reshuffle.ICYMI: Gigaba replaces Gordhan in cabinet reshuffleMantashe's remarks, in an interview with Eyewitness News, appear to contradict President Zuma's claim, in papers submitted to the Constitutional Court, that Mantashe and Ramaphosa were made to apologise at an NWC meeting following the reshuffle. Mantashe said, An NEC member who goes to a rally and says the three of us were asked to apologise; I think let me be diplomatic. He s very economical with facts. He should have been in a different meeting than I was. We were not asked to apoligse by any National Working Committee. Not unless that member was in a different meeting totally. So in actual fact that is something that is having no truth at all in it." eNCA

VANCOUVER, Canada - British inventor Richard Browning lifted off from the shore of Vancouver Harbor on Thursday in a personal flight suit that inspired references to comic superhero 'Iron Man.'Using thrusters attached to his arms and back, Browning flew in a circle and hovered a short distance from the ground, captivating attendees at a prestigious TED Conference.The personal flight suit is capable of propelling wearers much higher and faster, according to its creators."The hypothesis was that the human mind and body if properly augmented, could achieve some pretty cool stuff," the extreme athlete and engineer said at the gathering a short time earlier.

His startup, Gravity, formally debuted about a month ago with an early version suit called Daedalus.A 55-second video clip of the suit in action has logged more than a million views since being posted on YouTube about three weeks ago.Browning said he is already getting interested from investors and some in the British military who told him they had given up on the flight feature of an 'Iron Man' suit until seeing his human-propulsion gear.

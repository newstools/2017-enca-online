This is thus a strike on behalf of all workers, employed and unemployed, and all road-users, Saftu said. It is a fight for working class people to be respected and appreciated for the responsible and at times dangerous work they do to provide a vital service to their communities. -- Additional reporting: African News AgencyeNCA

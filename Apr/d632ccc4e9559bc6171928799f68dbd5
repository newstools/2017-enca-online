• Editor's note: This live event has ended. DURBAN - IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi briefed the media about the recent cabinet reshuffle. Buthelezi said President Jacob Zuma has failed South Africans. He's called for calm and says citizens should wait for the motion of no confidence before embarking on mass action. Buthelezi says the EFF's Julius Malema has spoken to ANC members and many indicated they will support the motion against Zuma. Other opposition parties met in Johannesburg on Monday to devise a strategy for removing President Zuma from office. In a joint statement the parties, which include the DA and EFF, said they’re planning a National Day of Action in Pretoria. The date has not yet been decided, but opposition leaders plan to approach civil society groups and other political parties to canvas support. The meeting follows widespread criticism of President  Zuma’s latest cabinet reshuffle. The main objection to the changes centres around the firing of Pravin Gordhan as minister of finance. eNCA

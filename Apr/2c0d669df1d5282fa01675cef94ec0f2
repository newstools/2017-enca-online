JOHANNESBURG - When I m not out with my feet firmly in the peddles and clocking Kms, or spending quality time with my 3 kids, you will most certainly find me at my office as the Head of A&R at Universal Music South Africa.I ve been working for a record label now for 20 years, after having been in the industry for some time before that, it was, has been and still is indeed a dream job. My role together with my team, see us being responsible for running the local music division. This includes scouting and finding new talent to sign, assisting with the songwriting process, recording and production, marketing, PR and establishment of each individual bands longterm brand , i.e. artist development.READ: How mapping ancestral genes could help the fight against TBIn some way or form, over the years, my team and I have played an integral part in the careers of South African artists/acts along the likes of as TiMO ODV, Beatenberg, Gangs of Ballet, Monark, Majozi, Prime Circle, Watershed, Richard Stirton, Rocco De Villiers, Charlize Berg, Neil Somers and most recently, we ve started working with Afrikaans artists Bok Van Blerk, Robbie Wessels, Karlien Van Jaarsveld, Dewald Wasserfall, Jo Black So why am I telling you this? It clearly has nothing to do with bicycles, stage races or sport . The reason is simple, I have a passion for South Africa and, by right, for this country s local offerings.Given the opportunity I will always support local brands, community and industry in all that I do, and it is for this reason that after 7 days of this journey, the Old Mutual joBerg2c, resonates so strongly.As we have traversed the kms, from one stage and race village to the next, through four provinces, and over 7 days, we have experienced a mixture of different towns and rural villages and through these ever changing unique South African landscapes, one thing has consistently struck me, being the sense of local community that is evident in so many places.It is easy to see that this race brings local communities together. For some along the route it is a joyous highlight in their annual calendar, for others a worthy town fundraiser.It is as an example, interesting to note, that majority of all the race villages that we ve had the privilege of staying in have been hosted by a local school.READ: Riding for a future without tuberculosisDay 1 was the Wilge River High School at Frankfort. Day 2 was the Reitz School utilising the Reitz Showgrounds (where they also host the Biele Mielie festival).Day 3 was the Harriston Preparatory School on the premises of the Sterkfontein Dam resort. Day 4 saw us entering the incredible Clifton School at Nottingham Road in the Midlands. Day 5, although we camped on one of the race organisers (Farmer Glen) own farm (Glencairn Farm), we were hosted by the Underberg Primary School and Underberg Spar.One can undeniably argue that the choice of location has a lot to do with relevant infrastructure in place for the race organisers, but we have been honoured at dinner and at each nightly race briefing, a headmaster, or representative of the school governing body or PTA has gotten up and told us what this race and the funds it brings, truly means for them.It is therefore so much more than a location, it is about how a race for the lucky few can benefit a much bigger local public. Their effort is to be commemorated, the race villages have been truly spectacular and the food, better than my own home cooking (and I can make a decent Tuna steak or Thai Chicken Curry if I say so myself).The water tables along the route have also been hosted by local community organisations church groups, farmers associations, the M.O.T.H.S and most recently (at water table 3/day 6 and water table 1/day 7) by Pevensey Place, Cerebral Palsy Home For Adults.It was incredibly humbling to be a highlight in these people s day as they went out of their way, offering to fill water bottles, wash dirty riding glasses, lubricate dusty bike chains, and of course, feed us with their vast and generous array of potatoes, boiled eggs, doughnuts, bananas, chocolates and jelly babies.The beauty of people seizing an opportunity and making a small difference in our, the riders, lives in this space and time.Another local , over this race, that needs a mention after my own personal near demise, is the official tech support for the race as a whole, namely Pyga. A world renowned South African bike brand, and the brainchild of Pietermaritzburg based Patrick Morewood, their operation is run out of Howick, and they produce bikes that punch far above their weight category, competing with (and dare I say), showing up some of the world s biggest competitive brands.But their support as the official tech support for the race sees them going far beyond any support crew that I ve ever experienced at any other riding event.They have a full on tech zone with some of the country s best bike mechanics at waterpoints along the route, and they have a experienced team of roving mechanics (on bikes, on the route) on the lookout for riders experiencing difficulty and in need of assistance.Where other races/events might see a rider having to pull out if they have the misfortune of doing serious damage to or even breaking a bike, joBerg2c and Pyga Mountain Bikes sole motivation is to get people to the finish .READ: TB still leading cause of death: StatsSAIt s more than a sense of support or duty, it a community of people with the same motivation, passion and end goal in mind.Perhaps a little too close to home, after having had an issue with my front derailleur that the mechanics tried to fix over-night. At 7:52am, with race start at 8am, Patrick Morewood was still inspecting the repair job with the opinion that it wasn t going to hold.In the space of 7 minutes, he and his mechanics came up with a solution (essentially stripping the BB, cranks and derailleur off my bike, and replacing it with that off one of their spare bikes ).Now if you re not a rider, all of what I ve just said will be meaningless bike/tech talk, but if you do ride a bike, you will know that this is faster than a Formula One Pit Crew and brings a whole new type of gratitude and earned loyalty for a local brand.Today s ride in itself was just incredible. Slightly shorter than every other day but still with its fair share of climbing but the most incredible single-track and downhill sections I ve experienced on the route so far.I returned grateful to the race village at the end of the stage, to my community of fellow riders surrounded by all the role players, and know that I am blessed to have experienced the last 7 days of a beautiful and proud local offering.Follow my journey on eNCA.comREAD: JoBerg2c a first timer s account, blogging and ridingREAD: JoBerg2c: A first timer s accountREAD: Day 3: Old Mutual JoBerg2c, complete and I am feeling strongREAD: Day 5 JoBerg2c: A first timer s accountPlease log onto http://morethanyourself.co.za/fundraiser/kevin-grenfell/ to support my ride and give your support, no matter how big all small.- Kevin Grenfell eNCA

There s nothing that links the applicant, except the admission statement. The state did not show this court how the applicant was involved, Msineki said.The magistrate granted Prince Dube R150,000 bail including conditions of reporting Monday to Friday and twice on weekends and that he had to surrender all his traveling documents.During judgement, Msineki said that Dube denied being involved in the heist and that there was no evidence linking him to the crime.In his affidavit Dube said he earned R400,000 per month.Later in court the accused said the amount was in fact his annual income. Colonel Mahlangu found that he had four previous convictions and it was contradictory to Dube s affidavit which said that he had two previous convictions. Dube s defence said that he couldn t remember all his convictions as they happened many years ago.The investigation officer found that Dube was not a documented citizen and that he was from Zimbabwe.The accused has four previous convictions of which he only disclosed two. Mahlangu said the accused was most likely to evade trial and commit other crimes.However, the magistrate said setting strict bail conditions could prevent Dube from evading trial.She said that the state had not given evidence or documents proving that Dube was a Zimbabwean or that he was illegally residing in South Africa. The identity number provided was used to find his previous convictions, it was used by SARS to find the various companies he owns.

There s nothing that links the accused to this case and that he was on the scene on commission of the offence. A SBV uniform was found in his possession, not a SAPS uniform. Msineki said that the investigation officer said that the money found could be linked to the crime, but there was no evidence directly linking it to the heist.Due to technical difficulties, the full judgement of Thando Sonqishe could not be read.The magistrate granted Thando Sonqishe bail of R100,000 and he has to report to the Midrand Police Station seven days a week and that he has to notify the investigating officer if he wished to leave the province.Court was adjourned to Tuesday.

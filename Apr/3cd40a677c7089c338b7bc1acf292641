JOHANNESBURG - Goals from Abbubaker Mobara and Thamsanqa Gabuza helped Orlando Pirates reach the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup as they defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 in a Ke Yona Last Eight match at Orlando Stadium on Saturday night.Although the visitors managed to find the back of the net courtesy of Kabelo Mahlasela s strike, it was not enough for them to bag a win.The hosts started like a house on fire as they were looking to book a spot in the last four, yet Siwelele s defence stood firm in the first 10 minutes.In the 18th minute, Celtic combined well in the middle of the park and midfielder Lantshene Phalane unleashed a powerful long-range shot which went straight to goalkeeper Siyabonga Mpontshane.Just after the 25th minute, Musa Nyatama nearly caught Mpontshane off guard with a well-struck curling shot, but it went inches wide of the left post.Kjell Jonevret s men controlled the proceedings towards the end of the first half, but they failed to break through the visiting defence as they went into the tunnel deadlocked at 0-0.

CAPE TOWN - The Two Oceans Aquarium issued a call to all beachgoers to be on the lookout for stranded sea turtles.In a statement, spokesperson Ren e Leeuwner said five loggerhead hatchlings had recently been brought to the Aquarium for rehabilitation.She said between April and June, the sea turtles wash up on Cape Town beaches.Leeuwner urged the public not to return the turtles to the sea, but rather keep them dry and at room temperature.People should contact the aquarium and deliver the turtle in a container with air holes.They should also inform the aquarium of the location in which it was found. Sea turtles are temperate water animals and when they are washed up on Western Cape beaches they are often suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and possibly infection."The Two Oceans Aquarium rehabilitates the stranded turtles and once they are strong and healthy enough, they are released.

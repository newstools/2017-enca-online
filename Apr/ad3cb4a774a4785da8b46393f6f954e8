PRETORIA - South Africans must stand up and reclaim the Constitution, that was the sentiment from the Save SA march in Pretoria on Monday.Addressing the crowd at Church Square, Mosiuoa Lekota of the Congress of the People (Cope) said the ANC must also give way as they have grossly undermined the supreme law of the land."We are being led by a group of men and women who support the undermining of out national Constitution. We are reclaiming the Constitution that we negotiated and adopted," Lekota told protesters.Save South Africa, Secton-27 and Corruption Watch are among the organisations that are taking part in Monday's protest actions after President Jacob Zuma relieved Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas, among others, of their ministerial positions, significantly weakening the rand against major currencies.eNCA

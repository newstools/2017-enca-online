JOHANNESBURG - Improving relations between Sudan and the United States, under President Donald Trump, could mean the permanent lifting of trade and economic sanctions by July, according to Sudan’s Finance Minister Badr Al Din Mahmoud. This follows Sudan actively supporting American anti-terrorism efforts in the region after formerly being accused by Washington of harbouring militants and sponsoring terrorism. Former President Barack Obama eased the 19-year economic and trade sanctions on Sudan in January.

In press statements after his return from Washington, where he headed Sudan’s delegation to the spring meeting of the International monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), Mahmoud said their discussions on the sidelines of the meeting showed some indicators for the permanent lifting of sanctions, the Sudan Tribune has reported. “We discussed with the top management of the IMF, WB and the US Department of Treasury, issues that would enable Sudan to integrate into the global economy and improve foreign relations, including the early preparation for the phase that will follow the lifting of sanctions,” he said. Mahmoud said a positive atmosphere had prevailed during the meetings between the Sudanese side and the executive directors of the IMF, WB and a number of influential countries, specifically creditor nations.

These Arab countries had also actively urged the WB to write off Sudan’s debt, while Khartoum has asked the representatives of the United Kingdom, which oversees the writing off of debt, to hold a roundtable meeting on the matter during the IMF and WB meeting in October. According to latest IMF reports, Sudan’s external debt stood at approximately $51 billion(R669bn) in 2016, up from $39.5 billion in 2010.  African News Agency

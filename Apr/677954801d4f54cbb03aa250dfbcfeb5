LOS ANGELES, United States - Alexandre Amiel was alarmed when his 11-year-old son asked the day after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish supermarket in Paris: "Why do they hate us?"The veteran filmmaker's answer is an unflinching exploration of racism in France at a time when the nationalist politics of presidential candidate Marine Le Pen have become part of the political mainstream, and racially-motivated attacks are on the rise."Why Do They Hate Us?" ("Pourquoi nous d testent-ils?"), which gets its US premiere on Sunday as part of the Colcoa festival of French film in Los Angeles, is a documentary with a difference. .@COLCOA is bringing the best of #France to the film capital of the world this week in #LosAngeles ------ https://t.co/KIfROzTHaP pic.twitter.com/eWlJEQajpp Like a non-fiction version of Mathieu Kassovitz's groundbreaking 1995 movie "La Haine," Amiel's three part documentary is told from his own perspective as a Jew but also through the eyes of a black man and Arab woman."We did three stories with people who are not especially victims of racism, but are going to take the audience by the hand and bring them a narration with two sides," says Amiel, 43."First, it's your own story and then it's an investigation of what racism is today."Part one was made by Lucien Jean-Baptiste, whose comedy "La premiere etoile" (2009) was nominated for best first film at the Cesars, France's equivalent of the Oscars.The filmmaker, who has Caribbean roots, investigates how blacks are represented in French society with right wing radio host Henry de Lesquen, who wants to ban what he calls "negro music."'Purge'In part two, comedian Amelle Chahbi, who is of Moroccan descent, looks at the Maghrebian community in Paris to see if integration is working, and confronts a fascist at a march.She asks the activist how he would keep Muslim numbers down and he replies, chillingly: "We need a president leading France who is a real nationalist, who will carry out a purge."READ: 'The Silence of the Lambs', director Jonathan Demme dies Lambert Wilson introducing : "I don't normally have butterflies in my stomach... but I do tonight."

In England, we didn't believe that they would leave Europe and they did. Maybe we learned a little bit from what happened elsewhere, we showed that we can sometimes be more intelligent. It doesn't happen often," he told AFP in Los Angeles."We'll see in two weeks but everything is in a good way. Trying to be optimistic doesn't make you more clever but it makes you more happy I think."AFP

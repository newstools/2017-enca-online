One of the immediate tasks that we ve committed ourselves to do immediately is to establish what we call a joint funeral committee. The funeral committee is established on the basis of the two provincial governments; the government of Mpumalanga and the government of Gauteng. We want to thank all emergency services workers. They conducted themselves in a professional way in an environment that was abnormally difficult for them. We also want to thank the team that is working on the DNA tests. They ve just confirmed with us yesterday that they will need a week to finalise the identification of all these learners. But only after a week that the funeral committee will make an announcement of both the memorial service as well as the funeral service, said Gauteng Basic Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi.READ: Father shares grief of losing all his children in Verena taxi crasheNCA

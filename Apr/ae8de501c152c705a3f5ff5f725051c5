LONDON - Olympic champion Nicola Adams is confident training alongside some of the world's leading boxers will stand her in good stead when she makes her professional debut in Manchester, northern England, on Saturday. Always smiling -- @NicolaAdamsOBE faces off with Virginia Noemi Carcamo ahead of Saturday night's pro debut ---- #ANewEra #Lioness -- pic.twitter.com/8kHe5HjOwVThe 34-year-old British sports star has been training in a San Francisco gym used by Andre Ward and Amir Khan ahead of her bout with Argentina's Virginia Carcamo.Virgil Hunter, Adams's new trainer, guided Ward from Olympic gold in 2004 to the heights of professional boxing and Adams believes he will do the same for her."There's so much knowledge in the gym and seeing guys like Andre Ward, who is the best in the world, training every day has left me a bit in awe to be honest," Adams said Thursday.

"Now she wants to emulate what she did in the amateurs by winning a pro world title, and I'm sure she'll do it sooner rather than later."It's a matter of being comfortable and when she believes she's ready. I think she could fight for a title right now, but it's about winning that title and retaining it, and that's what we've got to do."AFP

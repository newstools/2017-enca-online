JOHANNESBURG The thought of an electric pizza oven that is able to churn out pizza in 90 seconds flat might send chills down the spine of traditionalists, but have no fear: PRIMI's got your back.The Eastgate PRIMI recently embarked on a major refurbishment, which entailed a repositioning of the kitchen and the introduction of a high-tech, heavyweight pizza oven that not only whips out super-fast pizzas, but does so amazingly well.The new look is more "urban" than before, with grafitti on the walls, exposed ducting, better lighting, raw wooden floors and stone wooden floors.There are plug points to charge devices throughout the restaurant too, which will appeal to the lunchtime business trade.(Thank heavens sense prevailed with the group scrapping punching bags and orange prison overalls for its waiters all those years ago which made me want to sit quietly in a corner, wolf my burger down like we did in boarding school, and decamp for the closest exit.)Innovation seems to be the name of the game for the pizza oven sector on a recent trip to Italy, I was struck by the apparent scarcity of traditional dome-shaped, wood-fired brick ovens in parts of Rome. More eco-friendly and more efficient, hybrid (gas and wood-combo) ovens are the answer to an age-old problem: pollution and a heavy reliance on fuel.PRIMI's impressive new pizza oven, imported from Italy, uses gas burners and wood to fire up the oven quicker and more efficiently, without losing out on flavour. This is the clincher because barring the base without those smokey wood flavours, what's a pizza, but a mere grilled cheese and tomato sandwich?Reaching temperatures of around 450 C, the oven bakes perfect pizzas puffy on the edges, beautifully crisped but not burnt.PRIMI says it aims to make traditional pizza Napoletana, and while the cooking method might be high-tech, the flavours are true. They use natural yeast, stoneground flour (with a high protein content) and hand-knead their dough. This proves for 24 hours before it goes near the oven after that, it's whipped into shape, topped and popped into the oven.The topping options are not particularly classic, though, barring the Margherita and Siciliana. The other flavour combinations are more fashionable (but even snobs aren't likely to fault them either): a Moroccan chicken, topped with a Persian salad; Italian sausage, with red cabbage, blue cheese, salsa pomodoro, mozzarella and toasted fennel seed; a tricolore, with salsa pomodoro, mozzarella, salami, fresh tomato and avocado salsa; calzone with meatballs, spinach and feta; and so forth.Those who avoid wheat or gluten will likely find some comfort in their pizza and pasta options.The menu now includes a spuntini "sharing" section, with snacks including pan-seared calamari, chicken livers, carpaccio, meatballs and a blooming onion a battered, lotus-shaped carved onion.We shared snacks and a fabulous Margherita, which was worth the trip alone. Not as successful was my pescatore pasta, with prawns, mussels and calamari, pan-fried with wine, lemon, tomato and a touch of chilli. This was finished with lashings of a horribly soapy-tasting gremolata the seafood overcooked, the gremolata leaving an unpleasant aftertaste.A far better choice was his porcini rump, which was cooked to order and topped with a lovely creamed garlic and porcini mushroom pur e. With four bubblies, just nine whites, a rose and 10 reds on the wine list, the focus seems to be on cocktails and jars, which shouldn't put wine lovers off though because the selection is quite adequate. Dessert, a superb New York-style cheesecake topped with fresh berries, and coffee from their own roastery, went down a treat.PRIMI is a great, vibey meeting place for after-work drinks, a light lunch or even breakfasts.Their pizzas are definitely the way to go three issues though were off-putting: OTT portion size, over-cooked shellfish and over-seasoning. A little goes a long way. Too much, like that gremolata, lingers for far too long.PRIMI, Eastgate shopping centre. Tel: 011 622 1235eNCA

The Active Citizens Movement, which organised the service, had approached the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban, to have the Youth League barred from attending.But the court resolved they should be allowed to attend, but not to disrupt proceedings.Despite the court decision, Youth League members, who held placards in support of President Jacob Zuma and his latest cabinet reshuffle, disrupted numerous speeches before refusing to allow ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize - one of the NEC members who had been critical of President Zuma - to speak.

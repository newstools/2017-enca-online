CAPE TOWN Dam levels in the drought-hit Western Cape have dropped further to an average 22 percent despite good rainfall in parts of the province over Easter.Anton Bredell, the provincial minister for local government and environmental affairs, said a number of regions in the Western Cape were now showing huge strain in terms of water shortage. The disaster management centre is managing the situation on a daily basis and has already put contingency measures in place should matters escalate. Bredell said commendably water usage had been brought below the 700 milion litres a day mark and urged residents to continue to exercise restraint. The continued responsible and frugal use of water is of the utmost necessity at this stage while we wait on the winter rains to come. He cautioned that when the winter rains started in earnest, there would be a danger of mudslides because summer fires had destroyed swathes of vegetation.African News Agency

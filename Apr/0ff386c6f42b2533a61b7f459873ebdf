What an outstanding performance by our #10 Jayiya...worthy of winning #ManoftheMatch any day!#iamCityFC #Jayiya10 pic.twitter.com/0x9of3t08OJayiya sounded an early warning when he flashed a header just over the bar before putting the Cape side ahead in the sixth minute when he powered past a defender to get on the end of Lehlohonolo Majoro s through ball before smashing home a clinical finish into the roof of the net.The second goal arrived only six minutes later when Jayiya got ahead of Chippa goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi and prodded the ball home from close following a Lebogang Manyama cross.To the man who broke HISTORY in the PSL tonight.HATRICK IN 15mins..proud to call you a teammate!@BJayiya @CapeTownCityFC.#onwards&upwwards pic.twitter.com/KZAjWBGWPnAn Ebrahim Seedat delivery on 15th minute led to Jayiya completing a stunning hat-trick as he bravely headed in at the second attempt after his first effort had struck a defender and then hit the cross-bar.While Chippa failed to turn some promising possession into chances, the Citizens continued to look dangerous every time they attacked and there were further opportunities as Thamsanqa Mkhize twice went close before a brilliant save by Akpeyi kept out Manyama.READ: Cape Town City - The future of Cape Town football?The fourth goal came in first-half added time after Aubrey Ngoma showed some great skill down the left flank before cutting back the ball for Mkhize, who made no mistake this time with a perfectly executed low shot in at the far post.After taking a while to warm up after the break, City were resumed business and peppered the Chilli Boys goal with a succession of attempts but Majoro and Roland Putsche fired their shots straight at Akpeyi and Manyama smashed a volley wide.The shell-shocked Eastern Cape side were able to pull a goal back 15 minutes from time when after some neat interplay, Rhulani Manzini turned on the edge of the box and poked in a shot past Shu-iab Walters.Andile Mbenyane was unlucky not to get a second goal for Chippa when he thundered a 25-yard drive into the base of the upright.However, the night was to end on a sour note for Dan Malesela s team after Manzini was sent off in the 89th minute after two yellow cards.African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Energy has confirmed that the price of petrol in Gauteng will increase by 49c per litre on 3 May.This is due to the international product prices of petrol increasing during the recent period, as well as the rand having depreciated against the US dollar.The statement, released on Wednesday, said the price of diesel and illuminating paraffin would also be increasing next week.This will likely add to inflationary pressures and could hit the consumer s pocket hard.African News Agency

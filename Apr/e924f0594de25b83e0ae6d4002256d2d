PRETORIA - Jesse Kriel scored a late try to hand the Bulls a hard-fought 20-14 Super Rugby win over the Cheetahs in Pretoria on Saturday.In the end, the Bulls produced a much-improved second half performance to overturn an eight-point deficit and come away with their third win of the season.Ultimately, the match was decided in the 74th minute as some beautiful handling enabled the hosts to create an impressive breakaway try that was well finished by Kriel, who darted past a couple of desperate would-be defenders to dot down under the posts.READ: Bulls battle past Jaguares to win 26-13As they did last weekend against the Chiefs, the Cheetahs made an impressive start to the encounter and moved into a handy 8-0 lead after 10 minutes, with Paul Schoeman going over for the opening try early on.However, the Bulls slowly began to work their way into the match, and after a nearly 20-phase movement, the hosts won a penalty that was knocked over by Tian Schoeman right in front of the posts.It seemed that it might be the moment to spark the Bulls into life, but their insipid attack remained completely unthreatening, with the Cheetahs restoring an eight-point advantage when Marais slotted his second penalty before the break.The Bulls attack had been far too lateral in the first half, but they started the second stanza with clear intent to embrace some direct, hard running, and it reaped reward when replacement Jacques Potgieter barged over in the 54th minute.READ: Cheetahs relinquish 24-point lead, mauled 41-27The conversion from Schoeman reduced the deficit to just one point, but just after the hour mark the Cheetahs edged further ahead as Marais slotted a simple penalty.However, that was cancelled out by a second penalty to Schoeman, which ensured the Bulls remained very much in the match heading into the latter stages.Then came the moment that the home fans were waiting for as the Bulls finally managed to execute a free-flowing attacking movement for Kriel to go over for the match-winning try.African News Agency

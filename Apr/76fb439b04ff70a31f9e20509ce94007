We cannot imagine these weapons a day longer in the hands of mindless and heartless gangsters who have the potential to unleash terror on our communities. Sanco called for the speedy arrest of those behind the robbery. Criminals are the ones that should be disarmed and not be armed from state armouries. African News Agency

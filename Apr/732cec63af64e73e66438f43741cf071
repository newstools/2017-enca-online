It's not the start, there have been demonstrations, this is us joining the demonstrations this Wednesday. Firstly we don't want ubaba to have a proper birthday, because he must question his reason of existence that day, particularly existence at the highest office in the country and it's his birthday and we want to send a very strong message that we are not happy that you are alive and if you want us to be happy that you are alive you need to vacate this office and step down, said EFF spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.WATCH: #SaveSA, #SAunites marchesOn Wednesday, opposition parties are expected to march to the union buildings to call for Zuma to step down.Civil society has also called for the president to step down.

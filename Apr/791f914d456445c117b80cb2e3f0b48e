The ANC incited violence, and violence ensued."Yesterday (Thursday) the DA succeeded in interdicting Mayor Gumede in the High Court from inciting violence, yet it appears that her incitement had already spurred the ANC."The DA has also reliably learnt that the ANC pro-Zuma march in Durban today (Friday), in which the ANC assaulters partook, was not properly approved by the City. This must be investigated."The DA will tomorrow (Saturday) be laying criminal charges against the ANC for incitement to violence and will open a case of assault and political intimidation for the assault on our member," the party said in a statement.They concluded their communique by saying, "today the DA marched entirely peacefully, and although the message against Jacob Zuma was firm, our supporters' peaceful and lawful conduct must be praised. We wish to extend our appreciation to the South African Police for their work on today s event."eNCA

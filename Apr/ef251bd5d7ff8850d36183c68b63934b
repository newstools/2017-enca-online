HONG KONG - The euro surged on Monday after moderate Emmanuel Macron won the first round in France's presidential election and looked set to triumph in the run-off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen next month.Investors globally had been watching the vote fearing that a wave of populism, which swept Donald Trump to the White House and saw Britain leave the EU, could lead to a win for the anti-European Le Pen and put the future of the bloc in doubt.However, Macron is widely expected to gallop to victory over the divisive Front National leader and traders gave a huge thumbs-up, sending the euro flying above $1.09 at one point before paring the gains to $1.0846 from $1.0726 in New York on Friday. It also jumped to 119.40 yen from 117.07 yen."Markets are happy to buy what they see as the fact -- that 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron will be confirmed as the next president of the French republic in two weeks' time," Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, said in a commentary.READ: Macron, Le Pen set for French election run-offThe boost in optimism also hit the yen - considered a safe bet in times of uncertainty - which in turn lifted Japanese exporters.

CAIRO - At least 13 people were killed and 42 injured in an explosion inside a church in the Egyptian Nile delta city of Tanta on Sunday, Egypt's state television reported on Sunday.The blast which struck the Mar Girgis Coptic Church in the Nile Delta City of Tanta is 120 kilometres north of Cairo, the reports said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility and the cause of the blast was not yet known.A bombing at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral killed at least 25 people and wounded 49 in December, many of them women and children, in the deadliest attack on Egypt's Christian minority in years.Palm Sunday is one of the holiest days of the Christian calendar, marking the triumphant entrance of Jesus to the city of Jerusalem.Copts, who make up about one tenth of Egypt's population of more than 92 million and who celebrate Easter next weekend, have been targeted by several attacks in recent months.

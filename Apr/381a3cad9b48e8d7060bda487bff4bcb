NEW YORK - Sales of Ivanka Trump's clothing collection soared by nearly 61 percent in 2016, the company that manufactures products for the president's daughter's line and other brands said on Monday.The figures from the G-III Apparel Group cover wholesale revenue from February 2016 through January 2017, the company said in a recently released annual report.READ: Trump daughter Ivanka to get West Wing officeThat means it did not have data for February, when the department stores Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus dropped Trump's clothing and accessories under pressure from the "Grab Your Wallet" boycott campaign, which maintains a list of companies that sell products or support her father Donald.The stores' decision prompted a controversy during which Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway called on viewers during a television interview to buy Ivanka Trump merchandise.Critics said her comments highlighted the conflicts of interest of a White House run by the billionaire businessman advised by family members.READ: Ivanka an exception to Trump's 'buy American' pledgeIvanka Trump products generated revenue of $47.3 million (R659 million) in the reporting period, compared with $29.4 million the previous year.The G-III Apparel Group-- which also produces clothes for Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi's and Karl Lagerfeld -- said the Ivanka Trump brand is among the top three that contributed to an increase in its operating profit. That amounted to $840.9 million, against $836.8 million the year before.Still, the Ivanka Trump brand represented only 1.97 percent of G-III Apparel's total revenues.But the results appear to contradict Nordstrom's stated reason for dropping the Ivanka Trump line.

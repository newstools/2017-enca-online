READ: Dangor weighs in on Dlamini's role in Sassa crisisIn his affidavit, Dangor said he had warned Dlamini at a meeting in October that he had the "distinct impression" that there was an element of self-created delay to ensure CPS continued to pay social grants.He said he had raised concerns around potential legal challenges to a new contract with CPS, and whether this might delay the payment of grants.CPS director Nunthakumarin Pillay said in court papers that CPS does not consider this the appropriate time or forum to address the allegations and insinuations in Dangor's affidavits, as they felt it irrelevant to the issue before the court."FULL INTERVIEW: Zane Dangor resigns from Social DevelopmentFurthermore, Dangor says it was questionable for Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini to blame Sassa s executive for the grant payment crisis.Dangor told political analyst Karima Brown that Sassa s acting CEO and executive committee had been largely left out of decisions about the insourcing of a permanent payment method.He says he panicked last September after realising that the minister s office was not ready to take over the grant payment system. Dangor says he was even more concerned by a proposal to extend Cash Paymaster Services' contract for two years.He says he warned the department against this move. Meanwhile, Dangor say he found the minister s accusations of sexism and racism against him ironic. Dangor lastly said that it was the insistence on the extension of CPS s contract that broke down the relationship between Dangor and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. eNCA

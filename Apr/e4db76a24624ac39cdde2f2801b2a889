JOHANNESBURG - S&P Global Ratings said on Wednesday the recent cabinet reshuffle, that saw former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas axed, had damaged the relationship between business and government.READ: 'Corrupt S&P should not be allowed in SA' ANCWLSpeaking during a debate at Wits Business School on the effect of a credit rating downgrade, S&P South African sovereign analyst Gardner Rusike said there were strong green shoots under Gordhan. There was an element of government and business and labour which reduced the strikes seen in 2012 and had a relationship that could improve business confidence. We believe that the relationship has been hurt and to some extent, broken down. Rusike added that the three downgrades over the past five years showed that SA s credit story had been deteriorating.Econometrix MD Azar Jammine said investor confidence was more important than the rand or interest rates. Growth was low because investor confidence had declined, pulling down investment.He said Gordhan, who was working with business and government, was replaced and this indicated there would be a dramatic change in policy .Jammine asked why it was necessary to replace Gordhan if new Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba had said there would be no change in fiscal policy.Nedbank chief economist Dennis Dykes said ratings agencies were asking SA to do what it should have been doing all along: to implement the development plan it had in place.iNet Bridge

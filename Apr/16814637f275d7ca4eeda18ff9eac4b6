JOHANNESBURG Paramedics say children are dying in crashes simply because they are not restrained in a car seat.Netcare 911 says when paramedics are responding to crashes, they find children have died or critically injured because they weren't in a car seat or wearing a seat belt.READ: New law aims to ensure children's safety on the road This is not just very taxing on the family but also on the emergency services that has to try to save the child s life. Every day that we travel on the roads we observe little children standing in-between the seat of the car, lying on the seats sleeping or sitting on mom's or dad's lap, said Netcare 911 spokesperson, Chris Botha. This is very bad and a reckless practice. If for some reason the driver has to do an emergency stop, the child will be flung forward at a high speed and then crash into the windshield, or the back of the seats. We plead with people this holiday season to please take care and buckle those precious little ones up so that they may enjoy the holidays, Botha added.eNCA

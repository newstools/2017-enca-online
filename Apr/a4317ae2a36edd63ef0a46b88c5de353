JOHANNESBUEG - They are known as the Soweto Quartet, but don t mistake them for their famous musical namesakes.When these four discuss cadence they are talking about pedal strokes on their bicycles and not the tempo of their favourite song. They know all about tubes but not tubas, are familiar with flats but not flutes.And while Lazarus Master Mosuwe, Calvin Mono, Ace Mashawane and Bheki Mbele are not exactly household names in mountain biking, they are becoming pioneers for the sport in Soweto.From April 21 the quartet will be taking part in the Old Mutual joBerg2c, a mighty challenge that starts outside Johannesburg and ends at the sea at Scottburgh nine days later.That s 900km in nine days and a lot of mud, sweat and tears along the way. eNCA

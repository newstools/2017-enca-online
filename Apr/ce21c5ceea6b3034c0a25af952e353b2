MANAMA, Bahrain - A deflated Valtteri Bottas admitted that he felt very disappointed to be asked to let his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton pass him during Sunday s Bahrain Grand Prix.The 27-year-old Finn had started the race from his maiden pole position, but lacked competitive pace and struggled with his rear tyres on his way to finishing third behind Ferrari s victorious Sebastian Vettel and Hamilton. You know, honestly, as a racing driver it is the worst thing you want to hear, said Bottas. But that s how it is and although I didn t like it for my personal race, I am a team player and I understand. Team radio messages suggested Bottas was given instructions to let Hamilton pass him in the closing stages of an incident-filled race at least three times. For sure, I did it because there was potential that Lewis could challenge Sebastian, said Bottas. In the end, it didn t happen, but the team tried which I completely understand. Personally, it is tough for me, but that s life. I just didn t have enough pace today and we need to find the reasons for that. I think, overall, this was the best weekend for me with the team, but there is much more to come. AFP

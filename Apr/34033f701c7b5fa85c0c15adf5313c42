The RTMC would like to urge motorists to exercise extra caution when driving at night. It is unfortunate that this crash occurred a few days after the North West provincial government launched its Easter road safety plan. All road users are reminded to play their role in making the coming Easter period a safe one. The RTMC, all provincial and municipal traffic law enforcement authorities, and the South African Police Service would be out in full force this week in a national drive to reduce road carnage, Zwane said.African News Agency

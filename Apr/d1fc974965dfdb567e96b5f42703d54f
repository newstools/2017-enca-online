JOHANNESBURG The leader of the DA, Mmusi Maimane said on Tuesday that not a single one of the 14 companies involved in the scandalous upgrades at Nkandla had been blacklisted, or placed on the restricted supplier database . The Minister of Public Works, Nathi Nhleko, has revealed that eight of the 14 companies contracted to carry out the infamous upgrades to Jacob Zuma s Nkandla homestead have since been rehired by the department to perform other work, notwithstanding their involvement in the R250 million scandal, said Maimane in a statement.The DA leader said Nhleko had also confirmed that not a single one of these companies has been blacklisted or placed on the restricted supplier database .Maimane said in his reply to a DA written parliamentary question that the public works minister had confirmed that from 1 August 2014 to date the department had again contracted the following companies involved in the Nkandla upgrades: Otis, Pro-Hydraulics, Mustapha Cachalia Engineering; Ilangalethu Consult / R/G Consulting, Bonelena Construction Enterprise and Projects, E Magubane, and CA Du Toit.EXCLUSIVE: Architect desperate to sever ties with 'Nkandla consultants' This is a shocking revelation considering the Constitutional Court found these upgrades to be fraught with corruption and unlawful enrichment, and once again proves that the more connected and corruptible you are, the more valuable to the ANC government you become, and the more illegitimate money you can make, said Maimane.Meanwhile, the disciplinary hearings of public works officials linked to the Nkandla scandal are expected to resume on Tuesday.Yesterday things got off to a shaky start when one of the employees Sibusiso Chonco was a "no-show".Maimane said the DA would refer the matter of the Nkandla companies to the chief procurement officer at the National Treasury to intervene immediately and assess whether any of the companies involved had breached the Supply Change Management policy and/or the National Treasury regulations. We are adamant that any company or individual who unduly benefited from carrying out work at Nkandla must be blacklisted and held accountable for their actions, said the DA leader. We also note yesterday s suspicious U-turn by Minister Nhleko, whereby he cancelled a press briefing scheduled for today in which he planned to set the record straight on further upgrades to President Jacob Zuma s Nkandla homestead.Maimane said no reasons were given for the cancellation. I will therefore be submitting written questions to the minister, seeking an explanation for the proposed new upgrades at Nkandla. I wish to once again make it clear that the DA rejects any new or further upgrades to the President s Nkandla home, regardless of how they are described or categorised by the national government. We maintain that not another cent of taxpayers money must be spent at Nkandla for the benefit of one man, Maimane.The Presidency on Sunday denied newspaper reports that there were further renovations at taxpayers expense to Nkandla.

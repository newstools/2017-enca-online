Croatian deputies adopted a law on Thursday aimed at shielding the country's economy from failing key companies, prompted by a huge debt crisis at food giant Agrokor.The Balkans' largest food producer and retailer employs around 60,000 people in the region, with two-thirds of them in Croatia.ZAGREB, Croatia - Agrokor's revenue of about 6.7 billion euros (R97.95 billion) accounts for 15 percent of Croatia's gross domestic product, but September figures showed that the food giant's debt totalled some six billion euros.Central bank governor Boris Vujcic warned Thursday that the Agrokor crisis would "almost certainly have an impact on GDP."The new law relates to ailing firms with more than 5,000 employees and at least one billion euros in debt.It allows the government to name a trustee who would lead a restructuring process at the request of the company concerned, or at the request of its creditors if the company consents.A restructuring deal would have to be reached within 15 months or bankruptcy proceedings would be initiated.If applied to Agrokor, it would provide the time the group needs for "consolidation, paying of wages, regular business" and generating "new trust in the company," Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said.Meanwhile, police on Thursday launched a preliminary probe into Agrokor following a complaint on alleged financial irregularities. The preliminary investigation was opened upon a prosecutors' order, a police statement said without elaborating.Local media reported it was triggered by the complaint against Agrokor's management filed with prosecutors by the parliamentary speaker last week.Speaker Bozo Petrov filed the complaint on media reports that Agrokor was allegedly forging its financial statements.Separate to the bill, Agrokor and its board of creditors signed a deal at the weekend to enable its stabilisation, with a "chief restructuring officer" appointed from consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal.Earlier this year international rating agencies lowered the credit rating of Agrokor, citing its high indebtedness and rising refinancing risks.Owned by Croatian businessman Ivica Todoric, Agrokor also has employees in neighbouring Bosnia, Serbia and Slovenia.Its large network of suppliers means tens of thousands more people are affected by the crisis, in a region where unemployment runs high.AFP

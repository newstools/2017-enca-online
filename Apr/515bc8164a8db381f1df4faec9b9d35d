TOKYO - Tokyo stocks fell Tuesday with investors nervous about rising geopolitical tensions, while Toshiba ended lower as it faced a looming deadline to publish its overdue earnings report.North Korea on Tuesday denounced Washington's deployment of a naval strike group to the Korean peninsula, warning it was ready for "war".The deployment came days after an American cruise missile strike on Syria that was widely interpreted as putting Pyongyang on warning over its refusal to abandon its nuclear ambitions."Given its location, many in Japan pay close attention to the North Korean situation," said Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities."Tensions are higher than before after the US dispatch of naval ships", he told AFP.READ: Tokyo stocks end at six-month high after US debateTokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.27 percent, or 50.01 points, to end the day at 18,747.87, while the broader Topix index of all first-section issues fell 0.30 percent, or 4.55 points, to 1,495.10.Uncertainty over France's presidential election this month and the rise of the far right also weighed on sentiment.Currency traders pushed into the yen, which is seen as a safe investment in times of uncertainty or turmoil. The dollar slipped to 110.66 yen from 110.89 yen in New York.A stronger yen is seen as a negative for Japan's exporters as it can dent their bottom line by shrinking the value of overseas profits.The dollar-yen rate also weakened in response to US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen saying the central bank would keep to its plans to raise interest rates only gradually."It looks difficult for the yen to weaken significantly from here, given Yellen's stance for slow-paced rate hikes," Hiroyasu Iida, the head of the investment research centre at Aizawa Securities, told Bloomberg News.READ: Japanese investment in Africa 'mutually beneficial'Panasonic shares were down 0.39 percent to close at 1,266 yen, while Sony fell 0.59 percent to 3,532 yen.Toshiba declined 2.69 percent to finish at 223.5 yen, as it faced a looming deadline Tuesday to publish a long-overdue earnings report.If Toshiba fails to release its financial results Tuesday and regulators refuse to grant another extension, it faces the prospect of being delisted from the Tokyo exchange."(Investors) aren't seriously worried about delisting at the moment but we cannot rule out the possibility," said Matsuno of SMBC Friend Securities.AFP

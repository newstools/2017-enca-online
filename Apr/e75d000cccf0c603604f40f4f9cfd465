LEICESTER, United Kingdom - Diego Godin is not worried about Atletico Madrid's abysmal recent record with penalties, he said on Monday ahead of his side's Champions League quarter-final second leg at Leicester City.Antoine Griezmann scored from the spot to give Atletico a 1-0 win in last week's first leg, but he had squandered his previous four penalties taken during play.With Yannick Carrasco and Thomas Partey both fluffing their lines from 12 yards in Saturday's 3-0 win over Osasuna, Atletico have now failed to score their last six penalties in La Liga.But centre-back Godin told Monday's pre-game press conference: "It's an individual process. It's one v one, you against the goalkeeper. These things can happen in football. You can score or you can miss."We've spoken about it with the manager and as a group. But it's totally unrelated to the 90 minutes of the game. It's a one-off and sometimes these things happen."Atletico lost on penalties to Real Madrid in 2016 final and coach Diego Simeone has expressed misgivings about their record on spot-kicks."It is hard to explain," he said. "It is down to the individual every time, but it is certainly not just bad luck."Tuesday's game at the King Power Stadium can only go to penalties if the score is 1-0 to Leicester at the end of extra time.AFP

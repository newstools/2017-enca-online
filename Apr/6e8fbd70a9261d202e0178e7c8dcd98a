MUMBAI, India - An award-winning Hindi film exploring women's sexuality that was blocked by India's censorship board for being "lady-oriented" has been cleared for release by an appeals tribunal, officials said. India's Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) sparked uproar in February when it refused to certify "Lipstick Under My Burkha", in a case that again raised fears over creative freedom in the country.

I feel that we will be able to release the film without hampering the narrative or diluting its essence," Shrivastava told AFP. Finally! Controversial Lipstick Under My Burkha Cleared By Censor Board With A Rating #lipstickundermyburkha https://t.co/EqLDnKLN7H pic.twitter.com/jeO5RDROe4 The movie tells the secret lives of four women -- including a college student who wears a burkha, and a 55-year-old who rediscovers a sex life after the death of her husband.It won an award at the Tokyo International Film Festival last year and aired at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival in October. It also appeared at a film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month.The CBFC had ruled that the movie was "lady oriented, their fantasy above (sic) life".It complained of "sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography (phone sex) and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society", implying that it might offend Muslims.The ruling was widely mocked on social media while Shrivastava described it as an "assault on women's rights".India's censors have a long history of barring movies and cutting scenes, especially those deemed too racy or at risk of causing religious offence.In 2015 the CBFC blocked the release of a toned-down version of "Fifty Shades of Grey" and deemed two James Bond kissing scenes unsuitable for an Indian audience.AFP

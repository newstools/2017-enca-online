NEW YORK - The dollar dropped to a nearly three-week low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, pressured by lower Treasury yields. Sterling soared after Prime Minister Theresa May called for an early general election. US Treasury yields fell as nervousness ahead of France s first round of presidential elections at the weekend, while ongoing geopolitical tensions boosted demand for safe-haven US debt. "We still think the dollar is going to strengthen over time based on the outlook for US monetary policy ... but for now, with markets not heavily focused on monetary policy, it could explain this consolidation (for the greenback)," said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo.The US dollar index lost 0.45 percent to 99.842. It touched its lowest since 29 March at 99.799.Concerns about North Korea and the French presidential elections also kept a lid on the dollar against the yen - traditionally a haven for capital in times of political and economic stress - which has surged in the past two weeks.READ: Asia stocks mixed, dollar subdued amid N.

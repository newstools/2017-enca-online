NEW YORK - Haim, the pop band of three California sisters who found a ready fan base with a debut album four years ago, on Thursday announced a long-awaited follow-up.The band said "Something to Tell You" will come out July 7 and broke the news Wednesday night with a small gig at a Los Angeles deli where the sisters first performed as children.Haim released a first song, "Right Now," that moves the band's pop sound in a trippier direction, with a syncopated rhythm over the piano leading to a dark baritone saxophone.The band -- made up of sisters Alana, Danielle and Este Haim -- was described as a latter-day Fleetwood Mac when it released its debut album "Days Are Gone" in 2013.Haim won a growing fan base with appearances at the world's leading festivals -- plus a collaboration with Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks.As with "Days Are Gone," Haim said it worked on the latest album with producer Ariel Rechtshaid -- who in 2015 recorded Adele's hit "When We Were Young."The band also worked on the latest album with Rostam Batmanglij, best known for his alternative rock band Vampire Weekend.AFP

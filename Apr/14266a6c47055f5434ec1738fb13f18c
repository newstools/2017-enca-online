LOS ANGELES - "The Boss Baby," Fox's animated yarn about babies and pets vying over which is cuter, edged out blockbuster "Beauty and the Beast" to take the lead in its opening weekend on North American screens, according to an industry estimate."Baby" earned a cool $49-million for the three-day weekend, Exhibitor Relations said, nosing out Disney's "Beauty," which took in $47.5-million to give it a huge three-week domestic total of $395.5-million.Critics have shown little love for "Baby," in which Alec Baldwin voices the "Boss," fighting a secret war against puppies under the noses of oblivious humans. But audiences don't seem to care.Boosted by a strong backup cast, with Tobey Maguire, Steve Buscemi, Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow, 'Baby' has now taken in $876-million worldwide, according to the specialised website BoxOfficeMojo."Ghost in the Shell," a Paramount adaptation of a Japanese manga featuring Scarlett Johansson as a spandex-wearing warrior taking on terrorist hackers, placed a distant third in its opening week, with $190-million in ticket sales.

The Lionsgate production features Dacre Montgomery, RJ Cyler, Naomi Scott, Becky G and Ludi Lin as high schoolers with superpowers who battle the nefarious Rita Repulsa (Elizabeth Banks).

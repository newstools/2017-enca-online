Jaguar South Africa says it will introduce two new F-Type models into the range this year.They are based on the facelift.The first will be the new baseline model powered by the 2.0-litre Ingenium turbo petrol, the most powerful 4-cylinder series Jaguar engine ever made.Then there will be a previously-mentioned limited, special edition F-Type 400 Sport which unfortunately will not be widely available.With the 2.0-litre, Jaguar is entering unknown territory, but one which makes sales and ultimately, financial sense. And while the motor is entry-level, the power it delivers is certainly not.You cannot sniff at 221kW and 400Nm, as well as a claimed 100km/h acceleration time of 5.7 seconds.Jaguar also says it will reach a top speed of 249km/h and return 16% less fuel than the 250kW model. An 8-speed automatic gets power to the rear wheels.The F-Type 400 Sport uses a unique supercharged 3.0-litre V6 engine with 294kW of power, available with either all-wheel-drive or rear-wheel-drive, in both Coupe or Convertible / roadster using the 8-speed automatic box.It comes with a configurable Dynamic Mode standard, 20-inch alloy wheel in a Dark Satin Grey colour, special sports seats and can be had in either something called Yulong White, Indus Silver or Santorini Black.Both cars should be available for viewing at this year s Jaguar Simola Hillclimb in Knysna.Who knows, you might even win yourself a test drive in one of these babies.IN4RIDE

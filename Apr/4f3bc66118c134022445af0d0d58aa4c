We have sufficient information to send them to jail right now, an unnamed source close to the investigation told the City Press newspaper. We believe we have a strong case and we are ready to prosecute now. What delayed us was that some of them were not consistent in their submissions to us and the police. We needed to corroborate some of the information gathered so far. But we are confident that we have a tight case, and this should send a clear message that we mean business. Fortunately, we did not have to force confessions as these officials volunteered the information. On top of verbal and written confessions, the officials also submitted affidavits, so we believe we have a strong case, the source added.READ: FIFA president Infantino showers praise on SAFASAFA appear deadly serious about prosecuting the latest alleged perpetrators after a previous clampdown on corruption 2004 s Operation Dribble, was brushed under the carpet for the most part.And it s not only officials who are under the spotlight clubs could also find themselves being investigated, said SAFA CEO Dennis Mumble, who also confirmed that the six officials have been suspended.

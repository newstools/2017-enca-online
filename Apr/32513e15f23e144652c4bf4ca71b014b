The critics who've lambasted the Volkswagen Amarok for its lack of a 6-cylinder powerplant will soon have to eat their words ... the V6-powered double cab bakkie from Wolfsburg is on its way to South Africa.After driving it in Germany, here are 5 reasons we think it will rock the local bakkie market.The engine is magnificentOkay, it's admittedly not a unique motor, but rather one straight from the Volkswagen Group's engine line-up.Yes, it has been tuned for the Amarok package's specific requirements like extra durability, but we've seen this engine in the Volkswagen Touareg, Audi Q5/Q7 and in some Porsche products.On paper, it delivers pleasing numbers. How do peak outputs of 150 kW and 500 N.m or 165 kW and 550 Nm grab you? In the case of the latter, it goes up to 180 kW and 580 Nm for 10 seconds on overboost.It's a strong engine, offering flexible performance, especially in terms of overtaking acceleration at freeway speeds. Thanks to a combination of a well-ratio'd 8-speed automatic, there seems to be no let up in grunt and, as we found, the Amarok can decimate delimited sections of the Autobahn.Ride quality is excellent Thanks to their body-on-frame constructions and rudimentary suspension setups (compared with conventional passenger cars, for the purposes of more robust performance in off-road conditions), bakkies tend to have somewhat bouncy ride qualities.Things improve when the vehicles are loaded up to closer to their prescribed maximum payloads, but who has the patience to keep 500 kg in the back of their bakkie for the sake of comfortable ride quality? Yet, somehow the Volkswagen Amarok feels a bit more "family SUV" than "workhorse".It's certainly more comfortable on the open road than its rivals, despite riding on 20-inch wheels. We can also confirm that the flagship's 14-way electrically adjustable seats are really comfortable.The cabin has been reworkedThe Volkswagen Amarok V6 launch did not only encompass the introduction of a new, large-displacement motor, it included a facelift for the entire range.The derivative we drove featured a subtly redesigned cockpit, a multifunctional leather steering wheel with shift paddles, comfortable seats and an overhauled infotainment system; the latter of which features Apple CarPlay, navigation and mobile online services.Interestingly, the Volkswagen Amarok cabin also feels a lot more spacious than before and rear occupant space is commendable.Other convenience features include park distance control with a reverse-view camera. Cleverly, the camera is not mounted on the bakkie's tailgate, but adjacent to the number plate.It s still a practical bakkieMany consumers consider the Volkswagen Amarok as primarily a lifestyle/family vehicle by virtue of its build quality and general sophistication, but it can be put to work.Volkswagen claims it has the biggest load area in class and can carry over 1 tonne of cargo.It has extensive off-road aids such as hill start assist, hill descent, off-road ABS and a mechanical differential lock.The Amarok has a tow rating of 3 500 kg; we can't wait to put it to the test on our 4x4 routes, as the outgoing version acquitted itself well.It won t be cheapThe double-cab market appears to be splitting into distinctive sections. The likes of the Isuzu KB, Fiat Fullback, Mitsubishi Triton and the lesser Hilux and Ranger derivatives are aimed at those who need a bakkie for work purposes mostly, with family transport or leisure lifestyle pursuits playing a secondary role.The new Amarok V6, upcoming Nissan Navara (at least some of its derivatives) and eagerly anticipated Mercedes-Benz X-Class herald a new age for the bakkie market; it's clear the local market has drawn inspiration from America's Big Truck culture.These flagship bakkies won't be cheap, but they'll undoubtedly appeal to consumers who seek high-end luxury motoring combined with the "big truck" image.As it stands, the facelifted Volkswagen Amarok range arrives in South Africa in July 2017.The Ultimate Edition drops away and will be replaced by this Extreme Edition, badged as 'Aventura' in Europe.We will have 5 derivatives to choose from, with two V6s sitting at the top. The 2.0 TDI 103 kW and BiTDI 132 kW engines have been retained, but all eyes will be on the V6 models.Initial pricing hints suggest the Volkswagen Amarok 3.0 V6 Extreme 4Motion will be close to R800,000.

JOHANNESBURG - A labour expert says it's time for trade unions and employers to take a fresh approach to wage negotiations.He says more can be achieved for the broader society when there's greater collaboration in the work environment.Last week, bus commuters were left stranded as a result of a national strike.The bus drivers not only demanded better pay, they also called for conditions that are more conducive to improving safety on the roads.The strike was not only to the benefit of drivers, the demand for increased safety was also in aid of the public.But, a labour expert says the timing of the strike is yet another example that collective bargaining is failing the country.FULL STATEMENT: Numsa calls off bus strike"Industrial relations are viewed as a zero-sum game. Win or loose and the parties are demonished. That is not true," said industrial relations expert Professor Geoff Heald."Ultimately the parties have to live with on another. We need to understand when to cooperate, when to collaborate, when to compete and when to conflict."Although trade unions often meet before wage negotiations, a call has been made for closer co-operation between them to find the most effective solution to resolve deadlocks and disputes.While it's the norm that agreements are reached when unions with the most members accept the wage offer, often some refuse.The launch of South Africa s fourth major labour federation the South African Federation of Trade Unions is set to happen soon.It s still unclear how its presence will influence wage negotiations in the labour market.eNCA

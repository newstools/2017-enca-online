They agreed to cooperate with China to rein in North Korea, which has vowed to conduct more tests following Sunday's failed missile launch.Pence warned North Korea on Monday that recent American military strikes in Syria and Afghanistan showed President Donald Trump's resolve should not be questioned.READ: 'Mother of all bombs' in Afghanistan: five viewsPence and South Korea's acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, said they would proceed with the early deployment to South Korea of the US THAAD missile-defense system, in spite of China's objections.The Korean won weakened about 0.8 percent, with the dollar at 1,141.40 won."It seems the focus is now firmly on future missile tests from North Korea and whether any future tests will actually be successful," Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note.

His talks with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are expected to focus on security issues, while his meeting Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso will deal with economics."For dollar/yen, the main focus will be on what kind of pressure the United States could apply on Japan as basically US trade policy is linked with a policy for a weaker dollar," said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo."The yen cannot simply continue weakening along with higher stocks under such conditions," he said.China's CSI300 index was up about 0.2 percent after new home prices across China jumped 11.3 percent from a year earlier, with prices across many major cities soaring.The Australian dollar lost 0.4 percent to trade at $0.7559, and Australian shares slipped 1 percent, after minutes of the central bank's April meeting, in which it left rates unchanged, highlighted the balancing act it faced between a subdued labor market and escalating household debt.The euro was steady at $1.06425, holding Monday's 0.25 percent gain.In commodities, oil prices were little changed following Monday's losses, amid concerns over rising US production.US crude was at $52.62 a barrel, after falling 1 percent on Monday, its biggest decline in almost a month.Global benchmark Brent crude was at $55.38.Reuters

CAPE TOWN - A 93rd-minute winner by Judas Moseamedi saw Cape Town City beating title rivals Kaizer Chiefs 3-2 in a pulsating evening s league action at the Cape Town Stadium on Tuesday.Chiefs had twice come from a goal down and seemed set to have earned a draw, only for Moseamedi to steal all three points right at the death as Eric Tinkler s side stay top of the table with a once seemingly impossible dream of winning the league now a possible reality.The home team had the better of an end-to-end first half and started the game strongly as Roland Putsche sent a free kick and a shot narrowly wide while Lehlohonolo Majoro had a goal-bound effort blocked.READ: Venezuelan Paez upbeat and aiming high at ChiefsAnd City were ahead in the 16th minute through a brilliant solo effort from Aubrey Ngoma, who put on the afterburners to leave three Chiefs defenders for dead before burying the ball into the top corner from a tight angle.It left debutant Amakhosi goalkeeper, Bruce Bvuma, in for the injured Itumeleng Khune, to pick up the ball out the back of the net before even making a save in his professional career.But having sounded a warning earlier with a well-struck shot, Siphiwe Tshabala brought the Soweto side back into the game with an exquisite chip over home keeper Shu-aib Walters from 20 yards out; 1-1 with 20 minutes played in what was quickly becoming a thrilling encounter in front of a good crowd.The Cape side came storming back and had the Amakhosi defence scrambling to clear their own box on several occasions. And their intensity proved too much for Chiefs when Lebogang Manyama edged City ahead 10 minutes before halftime after putting the ball through the legs of George Maluleka before scoring on the angle via the aid of a slight deflection.READ: City remain tops as Downs close the gapThere was no letting up on the action after the break as nearly every move seemed to end with a chance on goal.Manyama had an especially good opportunity to add a third goal for the home team when he found himself with space in the box on 53 minutes, but he snatched at the half volley from the right-hand side.READ: Lebese's late goal gives Chiefs 1-0 win over ChippaAt the other end, Ramahlwe Mphahlele sent a header onto the roof of the net before City defender Robyn Johannes did brilliantly to clear Chiefs substitute Gustavo Paez s goal-bound shot off his own line just before the hour mark.Paez has become an increasingly important player for Chiefs and after a sustained period of pressure from the visitors, the Venezuelan did outstandingly well to beat Walters before picking out Joseph Molangoane for a simple tap-in on 71 minutes.The next big chance fell to Judas Moseamedi, who should have won the game for City three minutes from time, but sent his close-range snap shot wide with Bvuma rooted to the spot.But the big marksman to make amends deep in the final minute of added time when he steered in a header after Sibusiso Masina had won an aerial ball.AFP

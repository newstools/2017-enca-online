We don't want to."We want to remain in government so that we can change South Africa."The dismissal of Gordhan saw the Fitch and Standard & Poor's agencies cut South Africa's sovereign credit rating to junk status last week.The reshuffle also heightened calls for Zuma to resign, with several senior ANC figures criticising Gordhan's removal.ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize -- one of the party's top six leaders -- also spoke at the memorial service held in Zuma's stronghold of the eastern KwaZulu Natal province, but his speech was drowned by pro-Zuma chants and songs.Sunday's memorial was the latest of several being held across the country in honour of Kathrada, an ANC stalwart and one of Nelson Mandela's closest colleagues in the struggle against white minority rule who died nearly two weeks ago aged 87His funeral and other subsequent memorial services have turned into an anti-Zuma rallies with speakers drawing attention to the growing discontent within the ANC.AFP

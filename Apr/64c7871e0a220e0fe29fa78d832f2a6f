SOCHI, Russia - Lewis Hamilton on Thursday said he felt inspired by Serena Williams s "beautiful" reaction to being a victim of racial abuse by former tennis champion Ilie Nastase.The three-time world champion driver, who is a close friend of the 23-time Grand Slam winning tennis player, praised the American as a powerful, independent black woman .Nastase, a former French and US Open champion, was heard saying of the pregnant Williams baby, due later this year: Let s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk? Williams responded saying: It disappoints me to know we live in a society where people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and unborn child. --A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Hamilton re-posted her Instagram message and spoke out in support of her when he told reporters at the Russian Grand Prix on Thursday: I m very much with her in what she said. I thought it was beautiful what she wrote as a powerful, independent black woman. I just think she s awesome. She s not only one of the greatest people I know, but she s just a born leader and so, rather than react in a negative way, reading what she s written just inspires me -- and hopefully inspires others.

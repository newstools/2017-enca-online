WASHINGTON - A stellar lineup featuring three champions from last weekend's World Relays and two more Rio Olympic winners will lead the United States against global rivals at Saturday's 123rd Penn Relays.Spotlight events at the meeting at Philadelphia's Franklin Field, which opened in 1895, feature the USA Versus the World in men's and women's 4x100, 4x400 and sprint medley relays.

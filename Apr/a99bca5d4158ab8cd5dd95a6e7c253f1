We are there fighting for the Premier League."Despite that rare home defeat against Palace, Chelsea still have the fate of the title in their own hands.READ: Spurs showed heart of champions - PochettinoThey require 21 points to be certain of lifting the trophy, but Antonio Conte acknowledged it is far too soon to start planning any celebrations."Anything can happen, above all in England," he said."Every game is very tough against a strong team like Manchester City."It's important to prepare in the right way for this game.

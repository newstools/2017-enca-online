Cosatu is clear that as the [tripartite] alliance, we need to wage a robust struggle against our own weaknesses including self-criticism, but we will never sell out to the agents on white monopoly capital and their stooges," it said.The governing African National Congress, Cosatu and the South African Communist Party form the tripartite alliance. The fact that some people agree with us on the president stepping down, does not mean that they are our friends. They are saying this to drive their narrow regime change agenda and we reject it, Cosatu said. African News Agency

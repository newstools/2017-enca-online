Many of our members have a long history of struggle and are experienced at not cowing to intimidation of any sort."Members of social activist group Johannesburg Against Injustice engage in a stand-off against BLF members outside the Military Museum in Saxonwold, Johannesburg.JAI said it had made it clear that it respected the right of the Gupta family to engage in worship, but it also appealed to the family to respect the groups right to peaceful protest. It noted that JAI protesters had remained at a distance from the actual prayer venue and did not intimidate the few guests that attended the ceremony.WATCH: Opposition leaders address National Day Of Action protestersJAI said that, if anything, the actions of BLF were "unbecoming of a pious occasion like the Shrimad Bhagwat Katha."This validates our assertion that the prayer is nothing but a public relations exercise for the Gupta family."JAI said they were considering obtaining a restraining order against the BLF and the Gupta family.

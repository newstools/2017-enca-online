WELLINGTON, New Zealand - Beauden Barrett produced a masterclass performance, albeit with another yellow card, to get the Wellington Hurricanes home 28-24 against the Auckland Blues in their Super Rugby clash in Auckland on Saturday.Barrett was instrumental in three of the four Hurricanes tries in the fast but scrappy encounter where missed tackles and turnovers were rife.

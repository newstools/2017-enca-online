LONDON Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba will miss Thursday's Premier League trip to rivals Manchester City but the rested Antonio Valencia is set to return, said manager Jose Mourinho.Pogba, who rejoined United from Juventus for a world record fee of 89 million pounds ($114.36 million) in August, has a muscle injury. The Frenchman hobbled off the pitch in the last few minutes of Sunday's 2-0 victory at Burnley.Valencia was left out of the squad at Burnley after suffering fatigue but will be back for United at the Etihad.When asked if Pogba and midfielder Ander Herrera were fit for the derby, Mourinho said, "Paul, no. Herrera, yes.""We go with what we have, we fight with what we have, I trust the boys and I go with everything we have and we go until the (end of the) season, the boys, our fighters and we hope."READ: Mourinho decries 'enemies' after Pogba blowUnited, who are fifth in the league a point behind City, can leapfrog Pep Guardiola's fourth-placed side with a victory.

They face Spanish side Celta Vigo over two legs next month."We want to try and play Champions League football and we still have two doors open," added Mourinho.Reuters

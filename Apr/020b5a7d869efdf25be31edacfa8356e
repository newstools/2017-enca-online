NELSPRUIT George Lebese played the super substitute role to perfection, with his second-half strike, allowing title-chasing Kaizer Chiefs to move to joint top of the league standings, as they saw off relegation-haunted Chippa United 1-0 in an Absa Premiership match played at the Mbombela Stadium near Nelspruit on Saturday evening.Chiefs coach Steve Khompela would have had not-so-good memories of the first-round league encounter the sides played in Port Elizabeth earlier in the season, where the Amakhosi were on the receiving end of a 3-1 drubbing.The coach went into battle with an all-out attacking formation with Edmore Chirambadare, Siphiwe Tshabalala and the in-form former Chippa United winger Joseph Molangoane playing just behind target man, Venezuelan striker Gustavo Paez, who started in place of the suspended Bernard Parker.

Chippa will host Jomo Cosmos in their Nedbank Cup quarterfinal, at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Saturday.

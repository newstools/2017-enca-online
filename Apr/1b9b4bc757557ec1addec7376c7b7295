It is clear that some of our white compatriots regard black people as being lesser human beings or sub-human. The racist onslaught has become more direct and is no longer hidden as was the case in the early years of our constitutional democratic order. Racists no longer fear being caught or exposed, said Zuma. We call upon all freedom loving South Africans to unite and fight racism in our country in the memory of Chris Hani. Comrade Chris Hani abhor racism and fought against it all his life. He tragically lost his life at the hands of hard core racists. It will take time but it needs to be done if we are to achieve a truly united non-racial society, said the president.Hani was killed in 1993 outside his home in Boksburg. Polish immigrant and anti-communist Janusz Walu shot Hani while he was walking home from a morning jog.Clive Derby-Lewis was arrested as an accomplice for lending Walu his gun.Hani s death marked a turning point in South African history whiich was on a brink of civil war. eNCA

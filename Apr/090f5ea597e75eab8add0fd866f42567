The DA celebrates this victory along with the decision by the AUF to terminate its coalition with the ANC. AUF Mayor, Peter Lobese, has indicated that the coalition partnership has soured since its formation. There are numerous scandals plaguing the ANC and its associates in Bitou. Madikizela said the AUF has also called on other parties that may be in coalition with the ANC elsewhere in South Africa to terminate such agreements. Doing so would be an act of solidarity with the people of our country, who are protesting against Jacob Zuma s presidency. Jacob Zuma has again put the Guptas before the people with his latest Cabinet reshuffle, which saw Pravin Gordhan being fired. Madikizela said the DA sees the change in Bitou as an affirmation of our record of progress. We are committed to getting things back on track in Bitou. African News Agency

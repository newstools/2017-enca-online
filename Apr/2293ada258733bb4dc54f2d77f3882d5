PRETORIA - Injury-hit Mamelodi Sundowns will keep the same side for Thursday s Absa Premiership clash against neighbours SuperSport United despite losing on Saturday to Lamontville Golden Arrows in the second round of the Nedbank Cup, said coach Pitso Mosimane. This team will play again on Thursday. This team is still good enough, he said as he sought to rally his players after Sundowns extended their winless run to five in a row after being knocked out of the Nedbank Cup.READ: Arrows strike true to knock 'Downs out of Nedbank Cup I don t want to make excuses because that just opens a can of worms, but some things maybe happen for a reason. Everybody knows how tough our schedule is. We knew about the programme and that s how it is. It s life. But we just need one game because if we win just one game in the league everything turns around. We are still in the right place, maybe not the best, but we are still OK. It won t be easy in a local derby but we keep going and keep trying. We ll see how it goes. It was not the result we wanted, but we will pick ourselves up and push on. Keep track of our season here. pic.twitter.com/biqMz7hQLLSundowns made five changes going into the Cup match against Arrows at Atteridgeville where the Durban side pulled off an upset 1-0 win.

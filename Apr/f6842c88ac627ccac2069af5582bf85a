JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says the motive behind the break-in at his offices last month is still not clear.Addressing the 4th Congress of the Conference on Constitutional Jurisdictions of Africa in Cape Town on Monday, he said he had no idea how the investigation of the burglary was progressing."I m as ignorant as you are, I think the last thing I heard was the interview of the acting national commissioner.

We don t know who the suspect is and we don t know where this thing is going to, quite frankly." Mogoeng said."We know that the boxes were stolen and the screens were left there. I thought a thief would take both the screen and the box so that you sell a unit, but it looks like the keen interest was the information-storing gadget -- they are gone and I am ignorant as you are."Two men were arrested in connection with the break-in, but they were charged with other misdemeanours. eNCA

DURBAN Mamelodi Sundowns swept to the top of the standings with a 2-0 victory over Golden Arrows in an Absa Premiership clash played at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Friday night. It was goalless at halftime.It was the first time this season that the Pretoria club, the defending league champions, have topped the log. As it stands, Sundowns are on 50 points, followed by Cape Town City on 49, Wits on 48 and Kaizer Chiefs 45 points.The first opportunity came the way of the home side Arrows when Kudakwashe Mahachi was clean through on goal in the seventh minute. The Arrows attacker had only Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango to beat, but the keeper came out tops with a fine save to prevent his team from conceding an early goal.The let-off was the cure for Sundowns to put their efficient offensive machine into action and they were unlucky not to equalise with a long-range effort from midfielder Hlompho Kekana. Tebogo Langerman had another opportunity minutes later, but was foiled by a great save from Arrows goalkeeper NkosingiphileGumede.But, overall, it was a tight opening 45 minutes, with neither side really able to break the opposition down. Arrows were extremely compact in their structure and organisation, and it proved difficult for Sundowns to play their way through the Durban club s defensive lines.With Sundowns struggling to make headway against a stubborn and resolute Arrows, they brought on Teko Modise in the second half, with the veteran replacing Mzi Mashaba.Again, though, it was Arrows who had the opening opportunity of the half, but Onyango was able to deny Lerato Lamola s attempt at goal. Minutes later, Onyango was again a busy man, this time pulling off another great save to deny Mahachi.But Sundowns captain Kekana, who has developed an awesome reputation for long range goals, produced another trademark scorcher to give the Pretoria club a 1-0 lead in the 58th minute. In a game this tight, it was always going to need something special to open things up and Kekana s scorching strike was certainly something special.In the 70th minute, Sundowns went 2-0 up and it was the evergreen Modise who provided the cross for Motjeka Madisha to power home a header. Khama Billiat should have made it three just before the end, but his shot trickled agonisingly wide of goal.African News Agency

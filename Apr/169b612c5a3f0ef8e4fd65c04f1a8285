It's beginning to flatten out," Ehanire said."We cannot tell immediately how many doses of vaccines we will need. But we have placed an order for an additional two million doses," Ehanire said.Meningitis is caused by different types of bacteria, six of which can cause epidemics.It is transmitted between people through coughs and sneezes, and facilitated by cramped living conditions and close contact.The illness causes acute inflammation of the outer layers of the brain and spinal cord, with the most common symptoms being fever, headache and neck stiffness.Nigeria lies in the so-called "meningitis belt" of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, where outbreaks of the disease are a regular occurrence.AFP

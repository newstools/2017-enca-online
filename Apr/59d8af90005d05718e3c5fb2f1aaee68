JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng education officials say their new and improved online registration system is ready for action.Last year, the system crashed on the day it launched, leaving parents frustrated and children without school placements.MEC Panyaza Lesufi was left red-faced, trying to reassure parents their children would be placed in time, but when the school bell rang on the first academic day of the year, thousands of pupils were still sitting at home.READ: Time running out to register Gauteng pupilsLesufi is promising success this time around, saying the upgraded system also warns his team about teacher and equipment shortages.He said a number of improvements have been made to the system, ahead of the May registration period. Last year we struggled to take 25,000 logins per second; this year we have doubled that. We can take 50,000 logins per second. We have revamped the system, based on constructive criticism, Lesufi said.The department admits there is a shortage of schools in Gauteng. Even with its commitment to build a school a month, it still won t reach the required target.But Lesufi is promising no child will be left out in the cold. I d rather have an overcrowded classroom than have a child stay at home, and that is my approach because who s child must stay at home?

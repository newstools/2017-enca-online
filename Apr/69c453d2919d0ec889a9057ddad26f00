CAIRO - Egyptian Copts will celebrate Easter mass on Saturday just days after the deadliest attacks in living memory against the country's religious minority.The faithful will spend a large part of Easter eve going through arduous security checks outside places of worship, after twin Palm Sunday bombings killed 45 people in two cities north of Cairo.The government has declared a state of emergency and called in the army to protect "vital" installations following the suicide bombings in Tanta and Alexandria, which were claimed by the Islamic State group."Security has indeed improved so much as it seems the situation needed to be tightened up a lot," said Coptic Church spokesman Boulos Halim.Coptic Pope Tawadros II will lead Easter mass in Cairo's Saint Mark's Cathedral, while the church said celebrations this year would be scaled back."Tanta and Alexandria created a big shock, for all of Egypt," Halim said.READ: Egypt Church curtails Easter celebrations after bombingsEaster, which along with Christmas is one of Christianity's most important events, marks the resurrection of Christ three days after followers believe he was crucified.In Egypt, Copts break a 55-day fast abstaining from all animal products following Saturday's mass.The Sunday bombings were the latest in a series of attacks against Egypt's Copts, which make up around 10 percent of the population.In December, an IS suicide bomber struck a Cairo church, killing 29 people.Halim said the church would forgo Sunday morning's traditional celebrations.

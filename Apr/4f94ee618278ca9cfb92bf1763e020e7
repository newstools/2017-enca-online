NEW YORK Somaliland authorities should immediately release jailed Hangool News journalist Abdirahman Arab Da ud and cease intimidation of other members of the media, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said.Somaliland police arrested Abdirahman on April 11, according to Hargeisa-based journalist Khadar Nouh and chairperson of the Human Rights Center in Somaliland Guleid Ahmed Jama. It is believed that he is arrested for a news article accusing the police commissioner [Abdillahi Fadal Iman] of nepotism and clanism, Guleid told the CPJ. The online article was published on the Hangool News website on the same day that Abdirahman was arrested in a police raid on the Hangool News offices. Journalists in Somaliland must be able to operate freely and should not face intimidation by police or anyone else. Criticism of those in authority is no reason for arrest, CPJ Africa program co-ordinator Angela Quintal said.READ: Dozens of migrants die in the sea off SomalilandThe Somaliland police, Somaliland attorney general Hasan Ahmed Hasan, and Somaliland Information Minister Osman Abdillahi Sahardid did not respond to the CPJ s repeated phone calls.

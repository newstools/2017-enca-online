WASHINGTON, United States - For years, US cable operators got rich by offering fat "bundles" of hundreds of channels and raising prices regularly for television consumers.Now the "skinny bundle" is disrupting that model with internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programs.Google's YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for $35 monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony's PlayStation Vue, Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now.

But live channels will make streaming options more attractive.At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite.But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges.Some like AT&T already have a "skinny" offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice.Wolk said consumers don't appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because "they pay 30 percent less dollars but get 70 percent less content."He added that "a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum."Striking backWolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television.The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favor their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said.Operators are also keeping customers with "TV everywhere" which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while traveling, he noted.One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user.That's positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers.Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note.With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others "get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits."AFP

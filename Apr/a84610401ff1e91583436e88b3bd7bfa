PRETORIA - Acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane says all the marches planned in the capital for Friday are illegal. However, police will be on the ground to enforce the law during Friday's demonstrations, Phahlane said. Breaking: Phahlane says marches in Tshwane are illegal. 'Organisers failed to ensure approval from relevant authorities.' @eNCA "We do not have any of the documents for the marches or protest action planned around Pretoria," Phahlane emphasised. The commissioner followed the statement by reading letters from city officials that denied applicants permission to march on April 7. Earlier, a magistrate in Pretoria overturned Tshwane Metro Police's decision to disallow Save South Africa's anti-Zuma march on Friday. Section 27 then sought an interdict and were granted permission to continue with the march by Pretoria's Chief Magistrate. @SAPoliceService Police Commisioner called press conference to lie to the nation. Spread the news. Legal protest march tomorrow. #savesa #AntiZumaMarches pic.twitter.com/n4wSnp4lF1 eNCA

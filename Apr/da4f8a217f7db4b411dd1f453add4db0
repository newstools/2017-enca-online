NEW YORK, United States - Lady Gaga debuted a R&B-tinged love song Saturday as she headlined the Coachella festival, where the pop diva cast herself as sensual rather than sensational.The first woman in a decade to top the lineup at the premier music event, Lady Gaga unleashed an action-packed spectacle of acrobatic choreography that culminated in confetti, fireballs and fireworks on her dance anthem "Bad Romance."Gaga seized upon the spotlight to introduce a new song, "The Cure," that is built off an unadorned R&B rhythm before rising into a pop chorus with the lines, "If I can't find the cure, I'll fix you with my love."

On "John Wayne," one of her most country-driven songs in which she admits an attraction to rugged masculinity, Gaga paradoxically sang astride a human pyramid of her sweaty, topless and ethnically diverse crew of male dancers.Sensuality oozed throughout Gaga's set. She beckoned one dancer by grabbing his jeans in the waist, as both male and female dancers rubbed her leotard-clad body seductively."Have you all found someone you want to sleep with yet?" she teasingly asked the 100,000-strong crowd, most of them young and many of them clad only in the bare minimum of clothing after a long day in the sun.Yet for a singer once talked about as much for her outrageous outfits as her songs, she stepped back and put the emphasis on her music -- giving herself space to show off her glowing, rich voice on tracks such as "The Edge of Glory."Her biggest fashion message may have come as she played piano. She struggled to take off her sweater mid-song, in an endearing display of authenticity.Surprise guestsLady Gaga played her first Coachella after original headliner Beyonce canceled on doctors' orders as she expects twins.One of the most lucrative events on the global cultural calendar, Coachella takes place over back-to-back three-day weekends with identical lineups.In a Coachella hallmark, Saturday saw a slew of surprise performers -- delighting fans who avidly posted to social media.The rapper Future, who recently made history with back-to-back albums debuting at number one on the US chart, drew cheers when he brought to stage Migos, the Atlanta trio behind the hit "Bad and Boujee." .@coachella Portland pic.twitter.com/1p0UqXFtOc But an even bigger name soon came on -- rap superstar Drake, a sometime collaborator with Future, who turned the crowd into a sea of waving arms as he performed his hit "Fake Love."

The Irish trip-hop singer took the stage with her face covered by a mask made of interjoined dolls and later carried over her head a faceless, zebra-colored dummy.

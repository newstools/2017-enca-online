Another mainland banned HK movie - Trivisa - won tonight's Best Film after Ten Years from 2016. @SCMP_News pic.twitter.com/emRpmMNYjtOne of the short films featured in the dystopian project was directed by this year's winner Au. Major Chinese TV channels pulled out from broadcasting the awards last year, with the nomination of "Ten Years" for best picture widely believed to be the reason. This year several mainland news sites covered the awards but blocked mentions of "Trivisa", media in Hong Kong reported.The picture also won best screenplay, best film editing and best actor for Gordon Lam.AFP

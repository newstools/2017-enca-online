JOHANNESBURG The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department is searching for 1500 men and women to undergo training, and after they've successfully complete the training course they will stand a chance to become metro police officers, the city said on Sunday. I am searching for men and women who have the highest sense of justice and integrity to join [the] JMPD to serve and protect the residents of Joburg, mayoral committee member for safety Michael Sun said.This recruitment was the public safety department s first step under the new administration to not only enhance visible policing, but to also create jobs for men and women who might either be unemployed or searching for a meaningful way to contribute to society, he said. With an additional 1500 officers deployed in the city we are certain that visible policing will be more tangible and effective in curbing crime.

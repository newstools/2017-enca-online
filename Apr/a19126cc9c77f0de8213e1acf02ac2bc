JOHANNESBURG Calls for an investigation are growing into the so-called intelligence report, cited as the basis for removing Pravin Gordhan as Finance Minister.United Democratic Movement leader, Bantu Holomisa s has asked the Intelligence Portfolio Committee to demand an explanation from State Security Minister, David Mahlobo.ANC Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe said Gordhan's sacking was due to an irretrievable breakdown in the relationship between the president and Gordhan.Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete said Zuma motivated his decision, not just with a questionable intelligence report, but with thorough historic background.WATCH: Mbete will consider request for motion of no confidence in ZumaThe SACP has also asked the Inspector General of Intelligence to investigate the report s origins.But, Mahlobo said he doesn't know of any intelligence report. I have not seen the document you are claiming, because those who are claiming to have a document know that it was an intelligence document and it has some issues.""Why would people with an intelligence report not disclose who gave it to them, because those who have spoken have not said they were given the report at a meeting, whose the author and then the authors should deal with those issues. If that intelligence report is just being purported, why don't they formally present it to the minister of state security or our intelligence inspector for intelligence. eNCA

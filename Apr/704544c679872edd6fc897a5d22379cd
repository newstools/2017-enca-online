HELSINKI - It's called "Hellsinki" for a reason: Finland's heavy metal fans placed masks on four giant statues in the capital city on Friday to honour hard-rock group Kiss.State-owned railway operator VR invited four fans of the US band to paint black-and-white Kiss masks for the imposing figures that stand guard outside Helsinki's main railway station.The statues, officially called "lantern bearers" but better known among Finns as stone men, were given their makeover to mark the band's 10th concert next week in the Nordic country, which has one of the world's highest concentrations of headbangers.#KISSWORLD2017 Helsinki, Finland! https://t.co/LC1l9Osa7NKiss celebrated the statue tribute in a video post shared on the group's Twitter account.READ: Ethiopian band wins fans by melding rock with African soundsOne of the four selected, 46-year-old Sannaliina Kuussaari, said she was 13 when she attended her first Kiss concert and she is planning to take her daughter to see the band on 4 May."I'm a designer (by profession) and usually when I work, I listen to music at the same time.

This morning, soldiers stormed the police station and took away the head of the mobile unit to their military base," he said.He said the the soldiers' action angered some police officers who invaded the army base to free their boss."There was a shootout in which a soldier and a policeman were killed on the spot while two policemen who were injured later died of their wounds," he said.Yobe and two other states Borno and Adamawa in the north-east are the worst-hit in the eight-year Boko Haram Islamist insurgency in Nigeria.Boko Haram, which aims to impose a hardline Islamist legal system in Nigeria's mainly-Muslim north, has killed some 20,000 people and forced 2,6 million others to flee their homes since 2009.A joint military operation, comprising Nigerian army, navy, airforce and the police, and aided by regional forces, is currently battling the jihadists.

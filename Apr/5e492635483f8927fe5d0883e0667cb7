JOHANNESBURG - SA Communist Party leader Blade Nzimande said on Sunday it would take more than just calling for President Jacob Zuma's removal to fix the country's problems."It s not enough to the say the president must step down and then we fold our arms. We made the same mistake after Polokwane [the ANC's 2007 conference at which Jacob Zuma was elected to replace Thabo Mbeki]Nzimande said the strategic enemy was monopoly capital."It s monopoly capital, whether it s white or black. You can t say the Guptas are an alternative to monopoly capital. In fact, the Guptas are the first and their behaviour the most [urgent] thing to deal with." South Africans should not allow organs of states to be used to discredit or eliminate opponents, Nzimande said.WATCH: 'If JSE crashes, it crashes for the workers first': NzimandeeNCA

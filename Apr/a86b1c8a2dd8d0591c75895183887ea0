JOHANNESBURG President Jacob Zuma's hit back at those who've been critical of his latest decisions.Zuma said those who use funerals and memorials to fight political battles are uncomradely in their behaviour.On Saturday, he spoke at the unveiling of Collins Chabane's tombstone in Malamulele, Limpopo.The late Public Service and Administration Minister was killed in a car crash two years ago. The celebration of those of us who've left us is an occasion that we all come together to remember our comrade, family member, our brother. Because we were all here in these numbers when we were bidding farewell to him. And this is to come back and say yes, we have accepted he's no longer with us but we remember him, said Zuma.WATCH: Zuma speaks at Chabane tombstone unveiling It is therefore an important occasion, but not to talk and touch our feelings in the manner in which we were trying to console ourselves when we were saying goodbye to our comrade. Therefore, I'll just say a few words, because I contributed to the delay. As you know, if you're given the task I undertake at the moment, it's not a small task. eNCA

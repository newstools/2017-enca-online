We cannot count human flesh," Abdifatah Omar Halane, spokesman for Mogadishu's mayor, told reporters.Al Shabaab, waging an increasingly deadly campaign of bombings despite losing most of its territory to African Union peacekeepers supporting the Somali government, was behind the attack, according to Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Qaeda-affiliated group's spokesman for military operations.Nur said the car bomber appeared intent on hitting a convoy carrying Somali military commander Ahmed Mohamed Jimale and other senior officers, but was not close enough to cause any casualties among his entourage.Al Shabaab confirmed Jimale was their intended target, and that they had killed seven of his bodyguards in the attack.Reuters

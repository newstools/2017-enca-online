NEW YORK - Facing pressure from an activist investment fund, metals company Arconic, a recent spinoff from aluminium giant Alcoa, announced Monday that Klaus Kleinfeld would step down as chief executive.Kleinfeld, who previously led Alcoa, also resigned as an Arconic board member, the company said in a news release. Board member David Hess will serve as interim chief executive.Alcoa split in two in November 2016, creating Arconic for its growth-oriented businesses such as aerospace and automotive.Activists at Elliott Management had tried to oust Kleinfeld, but Arconic said he left by "mutual agreement" after the board learned he sent a letter directly to a senior officer of the investment fund without board authorization which "showed poor judgment."Elliott said in a news release the Kleinfeld letter "read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of Elliott Management based on completely false insinuations, a threat that we took seriously and about which we immediately and privately informed the Board."Elliott, which holds 13.2 percent of Arconic's shares, also has nominated four people to the board of ahead of the May 16 annual shareholder meeting, a step it says is needed to strengthen the company.However, Arconic said the decision to replace the CEO "was not made in response to the proxy fight or Elliott Management's criticisms of the Company's strategy, leadership or performance and is not in any way related to the financials or records of the Company."The board said it was "deeply grateful" to Kleinfeld for his work at Alcoa and Arconic.The company also suggested Elliott should drop the proxy campaign, which it called "highly disruptive and distracting."But Elliott made clear it would not withdraw the effort and said Kleinfeld's departure was only "a first step on the path to a new, stronger Arconic." Kleinfeld was responsible for "destroying enormous shareholder value" in coordination with the board, which has shown a "troubling pattern of embracing change belatedly and reluctantly only at the point at which it becomes inevitable, and for the apparent principal purpose of promoting the Board's own entrenchment," Elliott said.The company's share price rose 3.3 percent to $26.77 in afternoon trading.AFP

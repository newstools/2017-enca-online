NAIROBI Burundi's ruling party sought on Wednesday to distance itself from a viral video showing members of its feared youth wing threatening to impregnate opposition women.Hundreds of the youths known as Imbonerakure "those who see from afar" in the local Kirundi language are shown in military-like formation singing "impregnate the opposition so that they give birth to Imbonerakure".The ruling CNND-FDD initially said the video which began circulating three days ago had been faked by the opposition, but was on Wednesday forced to admit its authenticity after it sparked outrage on social media networks."A video has been circulating on social media showing youths gathering in Ntega in Kirundo province. Unfortunately some youths sang a song which is not consistent with the morals or ideology of the CNDD-FDD," the party's communication chief Nancy-Ninette Mutoni said in a statement.READ: South Africa's child support grant should start in pregnancy.

More than 400,000 have fled the country. AFP

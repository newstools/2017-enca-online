JOHANNESBURG - The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal has accused the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation of being hypocritical in its response to the heckling of former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize.This happened during a memorial service for Ahmed Kathrada in Durban on Sunday.ANCYL KZN Secretary Thanduzolo Sabelo said the memorial service was not organised by the foundation, as far as they are concerned. The foundation s Executive Director, Neeshan Balton, said the KZN youth league s conduct was disrespectful to the memory of Kathrada. Youth league members openly disregarded the court order preventing them from disrupting proceedings. Disrupting the ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize and former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s speeches simply points to the intolerance of youth league members," said Balton."Drowning out people s views simply because you may differ with them is reflective of undemocratic behaviour.

The event was supported by the Foundation.Since the President s midnight reshuffle, which saw Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas removed from Cabinet, there have been mounting protests against Zuma s leadership. Zuma has since said the protest marches against him were a sign that racism still exists .- Additional reporting ANAeNCA

WASHINGTON Twitter said on Wednesday user growth picked up in the past quarter, offering an upbeat outlook despite a decline in revenue and another loss for the social network.The first quarter results came in better than most forecasts, delivering an early pre-market lift for shares in Twitter, which has struggled to keep pace in the fast-moving world of social media.The closely watched metric of monthly active users grew nine percent from the same period a year ago to 328 million, while daily active users rose 14 percent.The net loss narrowed to $62 million (R820m) from $80 million a year earlier for Twitter, which has never reported a profit.READ: Twitter unveils 360-degree live videoRevenues meanwhile fell eight percent to $548 million -- which would normally be troubling for a social media group, but the figure was not as bad as feared.Twitter shares rallied nearly nine percent in pre-market trade, suggesting an easing of fears about the path forward for Twitter."We're delivering on our goal to build a service that people love to use, every day, and we're encouraged by the audience growth momentum we saw in the first quarter," chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement."While we continue to face revenue headwinds, we believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long term."

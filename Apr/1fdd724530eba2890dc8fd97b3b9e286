JOHANNESBURG - What does freedom mean? Two controversial works have recently divided South African society.A cartoon by Zapiro, commenting on state capture and captioned, She's all Yours, Boss!, controversially depicted the rape of South Africa.It shows President Zuma zipping up his trousers as one of the Gupta brothers gears up to rape South Africa, depicted as a woman.A work by controversial painter Ayanda Mabulu, The Economy of Rape, depicted President Jacob Zuma raping the late Nelson Mandela.For Mabulu, who maintains that the President is raping South Africa s democratic values, his work is a reflection of the country s state of affairs. . The ANC labelled Mabula's work grotesque, inflammatory and in poor taste.Similarly, Zapiro was condemned for reverting too easily to the rape metaphor.READ: 'I am not racist' says ZapiroEnca asked the Freedom of Expression Institute to weigh in on this debate.The institute noted that the advent of social media allows more people to engage and debate on topical issues, and said this was a sign of a healthy democratic state.But it said that if the subjects feel defamed, they have the right to legal recourse.*View the attached video and judge for yourself if the works are the art of taking it too far, or alternatively South Africa as the artists see it? eNCA

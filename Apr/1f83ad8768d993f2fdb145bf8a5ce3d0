LIVE BLOG: Countrywide People's MarchesJOHANNESBURG - While main protest cities like Johannesburg, Pretoria, Bloemfontein, and Durban maintain the utmost seriousness on their respective anti-Zuma marches, some people have decided to make their impressions felt on twitter.Yesssssssss ------------ @LirandzuThemba: Another message to Pres #Zuma #AntiZumaMarches pic.twitter.com/SMqwacSjUx"Groups gathered in their numbers from early on Friday, across the country to protest against President Jacob Zuma and his controversial cabinet reshuffle.The effect of the reshuffle saw to the downgrading of South Africa's credit to junk status and a significant weakening of the rand.This has culminated in an outcry on social media from leaders and citizens calling for Zuma's resignation.Perhaps it s a case of not being able to get off work to partake in the marches, or maybe it s just the comfort of taking up a good vantage point in front of a computer screen to watch today unfold.Zuma must go zuma must go zuma must goooooooo----------WTF pic.twitter.com/LTB5DYLFgZWhile a massive reaction on twitter was expected, today seems just a little bit different, giving an impression that people are hugely divided on the events of today.When wyt people march vs When black people march.

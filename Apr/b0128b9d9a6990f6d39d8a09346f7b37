Numsa was Cosatu s largest union with over 400,000 members.The Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu) subsequently also left Cosatu in support of the expelled Vavi and Numsa in 2016 and is now a Saftu affiliate. The union had been at odds with Cosatu since the expulsions, accusing the federation leaders led by Sidumo Dlamini of being biased against Numsa and Vavi.Saftu is now the country s fourth union federation after Cosatu, the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa), and the National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu). Cosatu is still the biggest of the federations.African News Agency

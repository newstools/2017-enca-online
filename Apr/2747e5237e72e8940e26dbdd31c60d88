The people that love Cristiano never doubt me."The four-time World Player of the Year took his tally to 98 goals in the Champions League added to his double as Madrid won the Uefa Super Cup back in 2014."I wanted to reach this record. To be able to reach this mark is an honour and against a team like Bayern it is even better," he added."I want to congratulate the team for the second-half performance. #RMUCL Great 90 minutes team!#HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/JAicWqIoHQ "We have a small advantage but we have to be calm for the second leg."Ronaldo has been rested far more throughout the course of the season by Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.And the Portuguese player said he has made major changes to his training regime to ensure he is injury free at the end of the campaign unlike recent seasons."I have prepared to be in good shape for the final month and a half of the season."I have made radical changes to my training schedule to get to the end of the season in top shape," he said."In the past few years I have got to the end of the season with small injuries."I have worked with the fitness coaches to be in shape for these two months."AFP

JOHANNESBURG - United States' race advocate, Rachel Dolezal, created controversy when she identified herself as an African-American despite being born to caucasian parents.Dolezal, who was president of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), resigned from her post in 2015 after her parents publicly outed her, insisting she is white.The 39-year-old built a career as an activist in the black community of Spokane. She also served as an independent mediator for the city's police force.Neither position required that she be black, but media reports said Dolezal identified herself in application forms and in various public appearances and writings as black. So, I knew Rachel Dolezal back when she still identified as white. She seemed broken, eager to fit in, and, yes, obsessed with blackness.Leaders from the city of Spokane said in a statement they were "disappointed" over the episode and "the alleged misrepresentation."Dolezal apparently resigned under pressure from the NAACP. .@IjeomaOluo's incredible profile of Rachel Dolezal is the only thing you need to read about Dolezal ever again: https://t.co/PkWN9ljNWn pic.twitter.com/N6VdChCnPVShe's currently in South Africa for the 'Quest for a Non-Racial South African Society' dialogue, that took place earlier this week.*Joanne Joseph chatted with her in studio - watch that full interview below: @RachelADolezal can't wait to start reading this :) pic.twitter.com/19QSptcjUFeNCA

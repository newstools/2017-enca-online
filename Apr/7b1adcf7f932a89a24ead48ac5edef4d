JOHANNESBURG - Groups of civil society organisations gathered in their numbers from early on Friday to protest against the cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma.The reshuffle led to ratings agency Standard and Poor's downgrading of South Africa's credit outlook to junk status and a significant weakening of the rand. Since then there has been an outcry from leaders and citizens calling for Zuma's resignation. OreNCA

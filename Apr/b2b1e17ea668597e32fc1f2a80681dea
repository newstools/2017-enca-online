DURBAN - Supersport United were made to work hard before seeing off the challenge of ABC Motsepe League (KwaZulu-Natal) side Kwadukuza United 2-0, in a Nedbank Cup Last 16 round fixture, at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Clermont, near Durban on Tuesday evening.A 36th minute Mandla Masango header from close range, to finish off a cross from Thuso Phala, plus an 85th-minute strike by midfielder Aubrey Modiba, was enough to see Supersport through.However, the match ended on a sour note for the Tshwane-based side, when Bafana Bafana midfielder Thabo Mnyamane, a second half substitute for Masango, received a red card after a challenge on Thapelo Aphane.READ: SuperSport sail into next round of Confed CupThe hosts showed great courage in attempting to take the game to their high-profile opponents, but struggled to make inroads against the Supersport defence of Michael Morton, Clayton Daniels, Denwin Farmer and Onismor Bhasera, resulting in goalkeeper Ronwen Williams having a relatively quiet evening.Supersport went into the match off the back of surrendering their 19-match unbeaten run to bottom-of-the-log Baroka FC in an Absa Premiership match at the weekend, and coach Stuart Baxter had to make some strategic team selection calls, knowing that his side has a tough CAF Confederation Cup qualifying round first leg match against Barrack Young Controllers in Libya on Sunday.Morne Nel and Modiba put in solid performances for the visitors in the centre of the park, and Baxter, who is expected to take over as the new Bafana Bafana coach at the end of the local season, will be happy that his side is back on the winning trail.Shout out to Thuso Phala for winning the man of the match award #NedbankCup2017 pic.twitter.com/gd3juX7bknKwadukuza, who ousted Ajax Cape Town from the lucrative cup competition via a penalty shootout in the previous round, looked a much more solid side than one that is lying in sixth position on the ABC Motsepe League (KwaZulu-Natal) table a full 12 points being log leaders Uthongathi FC, but cup football is a different ball game.The hosts goalkeeper Nimrode Tsengwa produced some super saves in the second half, two of which denied Supersport substitute Jeremy Brockie from getting on to the score-sheet.

What you are required to do as citizens of this country is to support the efforts that are going to be made by those who want to make sure our country lives up to the values of Nelson Mandela," Ramaphosa said, adding that the moment had arrived to get rid of greedy people.He had earlier spoken against the reshuffle and described it as unacceptable.Ramaphosa said he found it impossible to believe that a man (Pravin Gordhan) who had served the country with such distinction could be guilty of the alleged plotting mentioned in the unsubstantiated intelligence report that reportedly prompted President Jacob Zuma to recall Gordhan from the UK in order to fire him."I want to end by saying, let us remain optimistic as South Africans. The events that are unfolding now are not events that should make us scared, they are not events that should make us afraid of the future," Ramaphosa said during his address on Saturday.eNCA

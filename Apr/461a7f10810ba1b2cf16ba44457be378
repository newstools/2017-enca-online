RIP. pic.twitter.com/8RyDjxT5ixChairman Kaizer Motaung paid a sincere tribute to the Englishman: I m devastated to hear this. We kept in touch with his family through his ill health but it is still a big shock to learn that he is gone. Jeff loved and lived football. I am deeply hurt. It is hard to accept but what do you do when someone has earned his innings? On behalf of my family and the Kaizer Chiefs family I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to his family and friends, the chairman added. The football legend and friend is gone but his legacy at Chiefs is cast in stone. Rest in peace the champ, Jeff. Butler arrived at Chiefs in 1988 and coached the team during four separate spells. By the time he completed his final stint in 1996, he had guided Amakhosi to the 1988 JPS Knockout Cup and the league championship the following season, before adding the BP Top Eight Cup, Ohlsson s Challenge and the Charity Spectacular, justifying the chairman s wisdom in appointing him. When I recruited Jeff, he was in Cyprus. We brought him in to help turn our fortunes around at the time, and he did exactly that, said Motaung. African News Agency

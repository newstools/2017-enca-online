WEILLINGTON - The Otago Highlanders continued their rebound from a disappointing start to the season with a 40-15 bonus-point victory over the Sunwolves in Invercargill on Saturday.After winning just one of their first four matches, the Highlanders have now won their next four in a row with the six tries-to--two try win over the Japanese side.The outcome was settled in a mid-game break out when the Highlanders piled on five tries and 33 points in under 20 minutes.But while the scoreline looked overwhelming, Highlanders captain Ben Smith admitted it was not a perfect performance."We threw a few miracle balls and didn't show them respect and they made us pay at times," he said."There's a bit to work on. We've got a home game against the (Western) Stormers so we'll look to fix a few things up and look forward to that game next weekend."Outside of their scoring spree on either side of halftime points did come easily for the 2015 champions.In a first half struggle, the Sunwolves enjoyed a territorial advantage, during which Yu Tamura landed a handy penalty, but for much of the time they were guilty of kicking away possession.It was a questionable tactic against a Highlanders' backline featuring All Blacks Ben and Aaron Smith, Malakai Fekitoa and Waisake Naholo, as well as former New Zealand Sevens rep Matt Faddes.Fekitoa had them on the board after only four minutes from turnover ball on the halfway line which moved through seven sets of hands before the midfielder touched down.But it would be 30 minutes before the Highlanders would score again when Liam Squire launched their scoring spree and Aaron Smith also touched down before the break.With the Sunwolves still flat immediately after the resumption, Faddes scored twice and Ben Smith also crossed the line.Fly-half Marty Banks' conversion attempt of Smith's try was astray which was his first miss of the season after 24 successful shots at goal.With the margin extended to 40-3 in favour of the Highlanders, the Sunwolves regained their composure and came back with two tries of their own.South African-born backrower Willie Britz, who has previously played for the Golden Lions and Central Cheetahs, scored their first try and Australian Rahboni Warren-Vosayaco added the second.The Highlanders, now with five wins from eight games, host the Stormers next week while the Sunwolves, who have lost seven of eight games, play the Waikato Chiefs.AFP

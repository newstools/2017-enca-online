JOHANNESBURG The Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown has declined the R30-mmillion pay-out of former Eskom Group Chief Executive, Brian Molefe.Eskom had proposed the Molefe be paid out an R30m pension pay-out. I have considered the Eskom Board s reasoning in formulating the proposed pension pay-out and cannot support it. I found the argument presented by the Board on why the pension arrangement was conceived lacking in legal rationale, and it cannot be substantiated as a performance reward because Mr Molefe has already been granted a performance bonus for his contribution to the turnaround of Eskom, Brown said in a statement.READ: Former Eskom CEO gets R30-mil handshake Nor is the proposed pension pay-out justifiable in light of the current financial challenges faced not only by State-Owned Companies, but by the country as a whole. Given that I was not a party to the contract of employment concluded between the Eskom Board and Mr Molefe, I have instructed the Board to urgently engage Mr Molefe and report back to me with an appropriate pension proposal within seven days, she added.Brown said she has asked Eskom's board to investigate how its proposal got into the public domain before she had considered it.eNCA

LONDON - Luke Shaw is back in the Manchester United squad for Tuesday's Premier League match with Everton according to media reports after holding 'clear the air talks' with Jose Mourinho, who slammed him at the weekend..@Ibra_official is available tonight and was on target last time we faced Everton, back in December. pic.twitter.com/DJxZKR8mPEThe 21-year-old fullback, signed for over 30 million (R511 million) in 2014 from Southampton, was seen checking into the team hotel along with midfielder Paul Pogba, who has missed the past two matches due to a hamstring problem.Shaw -- who missed a lot of the 2016 campaign under Louis van Gaal due to injury -- was omitted from the squad for the 0-0 draw with West Brom on Saturday despite United's injury crisis as, not for the first time this season, Mourinho criticised him.READ: Mourinho hails fit-again Shaw after holiday 'sacrifice'Instead, three young players were included on the bench. The Portuguese said Shaw -- who has made just two appearances for United in the past four months -- was "a long way behind" his team-mates."I cannot compare the way he trains, the way he commits, the focus, the ambition," said the 54-year-old, whose side face a heavy schedule of eight matches in April.Mourinho's remarks received support from several former players turned pundits, including United great Gary Neville."The harshest possible comments that can be levelled at you is that you don't train hard enough," he told Sky Sports News."Jose has levelled that at Luke and I obviously worked with him for a couple of years with England. This is a sensational talent, who has got many years in front of him."Neville's brother Phil, also a former United and England regular, said Shaw should take a "long hard look at himself"."Something has to change for Luke Shaw, because someone with that ability has got to be England and Man United's number one left-back, and if he's not, then there is something fundamentally wrong," Neville told Press Association Sport.AFP

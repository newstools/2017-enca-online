JOHANNESBURG - The EFF has refuted a report that its bank account has been frozen.According to the report, the Johannesburg Labour Court ordered the freezing of the party's FNB account after it failed to pay a former employee who won a case against his dismissal through the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA)."The EFF account has not been frozen and has never been frozen," EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi told eNCA."It's functional -- the reports are not true."There are many people going around claiming they've got research skills but there was miscommunication at the lower level at CCMA. We are taking legal advice on this and we have a challenge," he added.* Ndlozi spoke to eNCA's Joanne Joseph. Listen to that full interview in the gallery above.eNCA

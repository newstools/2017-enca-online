CAPE TOWN Cape Town s 2017 fight calendar kicked off on Friday, when the EFC 58 weigh-in went out live across the country and the world, ahead of tomorrow night s thrilling EFC 58 fight night.#TheClinch: Five minutes before the @EFCworldwide weigh-ins start @GrandWestSA in Cape Town. #EFC58 pic.twitter.com/nQqbARoJtQTwo of the Mother City s favourite fight sons, former lightweight champion Don Magic Man Madge and Irshaad The White Tiger Sayed sit atop a mountain of a fight card, when they face lightweight champion Dave Pain Train Mazany and Tumisang The President Madiba respectively. Crowd support for Mazany and Madge was huge. Madge hit the scale first, acknowledging his screaming fans with a roar as his weight was announced, and then turning ice-cold and all business as he waited for the champion.#TheClinch: "I see holes in his game and he sees holes in mine, so we'll see who can patch those together." @MazanyMMA #EFC58 pic.twitter.com/oPmuZSEUWrMazany, an Alaskan and native of Las Vegas, has carved a colossal local following with his wild social media antics, committed performances and endless time to speak with fans. It showed with the crowd staying on their feet as he emerged. That Madge is the rightful challenger is without question, the absolute silence that settled as they stared each other down spoke volumes of how intensely fight fans are looking forward to their bout. It will be the ultimate test of skill and character, with no man a clear favourite.Irshaad The White Tiger Sayed stepped onto stage with his usual showman s flare, sporting blaring socks with billionaire gangster cap and shades. He s shown himself to be the king of mind games at weigh-ins past, but today he met his match. Madiba casually plucked the shades from Sayed s face and put them on himself, Sayed looking rattled at Madiba s slick table-turn. It took security to keep the two apart.#TheClinch: according to @TumisangMadiba looks like @IrshaadSayed sunglasses need some shade time. #EFC58 pic.twitter.com/8M7jOZByF6If their pre-fight banter was all talk before today, the line has now been crossed. Most fans would score round weigh-in to Madiba. Supporting tomorrow night s top two bouts is a beast of a card. Former champion and former UFC heavyweight Ruan Fangz Potts faces England s terrifying Karl Etherington in his EFC debut. The stage shook with both Potts and Etherington padding across it, both clearing 115kg of pure muscle. Veteran Abdul Hollywood Hassan looked shredded and focused, glaring up at the almost a head taller Sylvester Chipfumbu. Strike from distance, knock him out the rangy Chipfumbu must have been musing. Take him down, grind him out, would be Hassan s decorated grappler s response.It was all fire when former welterweight champion Dino The Lion Bagattin stepped into the lights. He faces Cape Town s wild man Shaun De Lange tomorrow. De Lange is known for his grit and growing skill set, with all of his fights being unforgettable spectacles. Bagattin must win to prove his legacy and will use tempered, brutal striking, while De Lange is fired up to take the scalp of a King by leaving it all in the Hexagon. One athlete failed to make weight. Jasen van der Merwe received financial penalty.The official EFC 58 weigh-in results are as follows:Fight 1: Bantamweight Faeez Jacobs 60.50kg Jesse Fleming 60.35kgFight 2: Featherweight Caleb Ridley 65.75kg Kevin Pheko 65.50kgFight 3: Lightweight Rodrique Kena 69.45kg Duane Jones 69.55kgFight 4: Featherweight Aadam Grant 66.00kg Claude Ntumba 65.75kgFight 5: Bantamweight Jasen van der Merwe 62.60kg Gary Joshua 59.95kgFight 6: Lightweight Deon Bruning 69.90kg Regis Muyambo 69.85kgFight 7: Welterwerweight Shaun de Lange 76.75kg Dino Bagattin 76.79kgFight 8: Catchweight Abdul Hassan 59.95kgkg Sylvester Chipfumbu 59.75kgFight 9: Heavyweight Ruan Potts 118.75kg Karl Etherington 118.50kgFight 10: Bantamweight Tumisang Madiba 60.00kg Irshaad Sayed 61.00kgFight 11: Lightweight Title Fight Don Madge 69.75kg Dave Mazany 69.80kgeNCA

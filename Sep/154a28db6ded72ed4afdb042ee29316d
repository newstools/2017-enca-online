Khoza said that, while colonialism and apartheid had oppressed the citizens of South Africa, it was more shocking "when your own comrades oppress you with corruption." She said the party was no longer in a position to self-correct. Khoza called on President Zuma to step down. The ANC caucus in Parliament said they had as yet received no notification of Khoza's resignation. Until they received such notification, she would remain a member of Parliament. She thanked the many women who had supported her during these difficult times. eNCA

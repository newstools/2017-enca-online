JOHANNESBURG - Former KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson, Senzo Mchunu, says he does not want his old position back.Mchunu lost the post to Sihle Zikalala in 2015 and that elective conference has now been declared invalid by the KwaZulu-Natal High Court.WATCH: ANC KZN does battle in court I remain a member of the African National Congress good standing in ward 23 nothing below and nothing above. All I would say about the matter you are talking about is that there is matter that has not been resolved. I made request to the ANC that when I was removed the accusation that were levelled against me need to be reviewed in a platform where I will get an opportunity to defend myself against those accusations. As long as I get an opportunity to defend myself against accusations I would say I am quite happy where I am," says Senzo Mchunu, Former KZN ANC Chairperson.

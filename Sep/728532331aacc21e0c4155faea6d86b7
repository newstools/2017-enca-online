SASOLBURG – Three people were killed and five others were injured, two critically, when two cars collided head-on on the R57 near Sasolburg in the Free State on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at about 2.30pm and found the drivers of both cars still trapped in their vehicles, ER24 spokeswoman Annine Siddall said. “Unfortunately there was nothing paramedics could do to save the two women and a 14-year-old front seat passenger, and they were declared dead on the scene,” said Siddall.

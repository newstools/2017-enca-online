That was the evidence of the state’s final witness, Captain Marius Joubert, in the trial of triple axe-murder accused Henri van Breda. Van Breda (22) pleaded not guilty to axing to death his mother, father and brother at their upmarket Stellenbosch home in 2015. His younger sister survived the attack but suffers from retrograde amnesia.

Joubert referred to blood spatter patterns at the crime scene, saying the microscopic blood particles - not visible to the naked eye - were found on a door handle, tap and wall in the shower after chemical tests were conducted. He told the court 67 blood stains, belonging to deceased family members, were found on the shorts of Henri van Breda. "The blood stain pattern identified B19 swipe pattern suggests that the victim Rudi van Breda was dragged or moved from the victim's bed to the carpet between the two beds and further dragged or moved over the carpet between the two beds towards the wooden floor." eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Two Zimbabwean journalists have been hospitalised after they were injured during protests in Harare. Reporter Mugove Tafirenyika and photographer Brighton Goko were allegedly assaulted by police while they were covering a protest against the country's economic crisis.
	
	Media advocacy groups say harassment of Zimbabwean journalists has been on the rise in recent months. During Friday's protest human rights activists demanded President Robert Mugabe's government resolve a crisis which has seen the country hit by shortages of fuel, cash and other basic commodities. Several shops were closed as activists engaged in running battles with police.
	
	"I was going to cover a demonstration by the MDC and jamuka. I didn't know exactly where they were demonstrating from and to, so I passed through the stores trying to establish where they were headed. I saw a gorup of police coming my way and I heard a sound, something hit me on my head and I fell,‚Äù said Mugove Tafirenyika, Daily News Zimbabwe Reporter.

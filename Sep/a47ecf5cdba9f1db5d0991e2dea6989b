JOHANNESBURG - Zimbabwe's ruling elite has diverted the country's vast diamond riches to help fund repression by dodging sanctions and raising money for security forces, an anti-corruption campaign group alleged Monday.In a report, Global Witness accused top security and political leaders of secretly profiting from the trade in the country's diamond reserves while depriving the impoverished nation of much-needed revenue.The Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) spy agency allegedly held a concealed stake in a company active in the Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, according to secret documents Global Witness said it had seen.The group's report, "An Inside Job", suggests that diamonds produced by the CIO-linked company were traded in Antwerp and Dubai - two of the world's leading precious stone marketplaces - and may have funded political repression.

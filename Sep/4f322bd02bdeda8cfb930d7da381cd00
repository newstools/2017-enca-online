JOHANNESBURG – The percentage of Johannesburg power outages caused by cable theft is 10 times bigger than it was in 2005. Thousands of customers in the city's CBD remained without electricity for a fifth day after thieves gained access to underground tunnels. City Power said they hope to get customers back onto the grid from Saturday. The power utility said it's working 24 hours a day in an effort to get parts of the Johannesburg CBD back online. For that to happen, 36 kilometres worth of copper cable needs to be replaced. A new cable is needed to relink the three electricity substations that supply power to about 20,000 customers in the city centre. “We are replacing the stolen 11-volt cable - the cable we are in installing here is single core cable and the cable we are pulling from here to John Ware is about 20 km of cable,” said City Power spokesperson, Louis Pieterse.

Authorities admit that cable theft is a major headache for the city. “In 2005 total outage caused by cable theft was at four percent, now it’s at 40 percent and the reason for that is the huge increase in the market so there is a demand,” Pieterse said. City Power hopes to improve the situation by increasing patrols and upping other security measures. “We have cameras at the stations linked to almost all the tunnels, but the cameras are focused on in control rooms, we are installing additional cameras also focusing on the entry points of the stations and we are going to install cameras along cable tunnel as well as smoke and heat detectors” Last weekend’s theft and burning of cables have cost the city about R45 million. eNCA

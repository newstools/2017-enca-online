JOHANNESBURG – The rand was hovering around R13/$ at the opening of local trade on Wednesday as the dollar battled to remain at the firmer levels it flirted with on Tuesday.

The data may lead the US Federal Reserve to become even more dovish than it is already‚ after having increased twice this year.

The rand was set to exhibit short-term technical weakness‚ Momentum SP Reid analysts said. “But losses were still likely to be initially muted‚” Momentum said.

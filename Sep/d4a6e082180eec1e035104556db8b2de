HUDDERSFIELD - Harry Kane's stunning September continued with two goals in a 4-0 Premier League win at promoted Huddersfield Town on Saturday. Kane, who netted 13 goals for club and country this month including a Champions League hat-trick at Apoel Nicosia, opened the scoring in the ninth minute with a confident finish after robbing Town defender Chris Loewe. Ben Davies made it 2-0, firing home after another slip-up from the unfortunate Loewe in the 23rd minute before Kane grabbed his second in spectacular fashion. The England forward left two markers for dead on the edge of the penalty area with a clever body swerve and fired an unstoppable shot into the corner.

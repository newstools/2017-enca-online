JOHANNESBURG - Missed flights and delays - many travellers have experienced frustrating dramas at airports.  But one woman made the most of a night spent at an airport in Charlotte, North Carolina after she missed her flight last week.  Mahshid Mazooji made a video of herself and airport staff dancing to Lionel Richie's hit song "All Night Long". On her YouTube page, Mazooji explained that rather than be angry, she decided to take matters into her own hands.  "I didn't want to sit in anger all night long, so instead I did what makes me happiest...DANCE!!!!" she wrote. The video went viral and caught the eye of the superstar singer himself. eNCA

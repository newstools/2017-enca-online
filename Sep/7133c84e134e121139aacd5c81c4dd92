JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways says it will consider suing the Public Protector, if she orders the airline to reinstate alleged corruption whistleblowers. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane says SAA reneged on its promise to halt disciplinary action against nine employees who reported financial irregularities. But SAA says it made no such promise - and has already fired four of the whistleblowers.

"They posted disparaging comments on social media which impacted on the dignity of staff etc etc four have been dismissed," said South African Airways Spokesperson Tlali Tlali. Tlali says SAA welcomes the Public Protector's investigation into alleged financial mismanagement at the airline, but is adamant she doesn't have the power to intervene in its labour disputes. Mkhwebane is investigating claims of rampant corruption and financial mismanagement at SAA, but hopes to release an interim report on alleged whistleblower victimisation by the end of September. eNCA

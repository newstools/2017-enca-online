We ll continue to see support from the agricultural sector as well as the mining sector. An interesting thing in terms of manufacturing is what has been driving that. Better basic food, beverage, metal performance or demand. Because we have better beverage and food, that has also supported the retail numbers that has come out," said Novare economic strategist Tumisho Grater.The economy entered a technical recession earlier this year after two consecutive quarters of economic decline.Agriculture and mining were the only two industries that expanded in the first quarter, and both continued to perform well in the three months through June.Farming output improved as the worst drought in more than a century eased in parts of the country, and mining benefited from rising commodity prices."In terms of growth for the rest of the year we will be better than last year. We ll finish off the year hopefully round about half a percent. Marginally better growth, not shooting out the lights," Grater said.Some economists said they don t think the likely uptick is the start of a renewed growth cycle, but the fear that South Africa could be headed for a deep recession might decrease once the official data is released.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - In August 2016, following the announcement of the results of South Africa’s heated municipal elections, four young women interrupted President Jacob Zuma’s victory address at the elections centre in Pretoria. Theirs was a silent protest but it caused ripples across the country. They were bearing placards imploring South Africans to "Remember Khwezi". They were forcibly removed by security guards, but the message hit home.

Following her death in October last year, her name was revealed: Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo, the daughter of one of Zuma's close friends. Before she died, award-winning journalist and former radio talk show host, Redi Tlhabi worked with Kuzwayo on a book about her life. WATCH: 'Hitmen for Hire': an original look at South Africa's underbelly Khwezi: the remarkable story of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo (Jonathan Ball) reveals how as a young girl living in ANC camps in exile she was raped by the very men who were supposed to protect her; how as an adult she was driven once again into exile, suffering not only at the hands of Zuma’s devotees but under the harsh eye of the media. In sensitive and considered prose, Tlhabi breathes life into a woman for so long forced to live in the shadows, giving agency back to Kuzwayo.

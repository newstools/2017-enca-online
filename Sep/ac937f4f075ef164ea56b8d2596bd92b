JOHANNESBURG – The City of Johannesburg on Thursday morning announced that power was finally restored in the CBD after an 11-day blackout. Parts of the inner city were plunged into darkness for more than a week following copper cable theft from underground tunnels. A fire, which broke out during the theft, damaged other cables and affected multiple feeders as well as load centres at various sub-stations. The power outage left businnesses and residents with no electricity, with some companies resorting to generators, moving from the area or closing down completely. Areas affected by the blackout included Carlton Centre, the Gauteng Premier’s Office, Jeppe, Plein, Pritchard, President, Albertina Sisulu, Bree, Marshalltown, Kaserne, Selby and Durban streets.

	“By yesterday, only a small portion of Plein Street was still down and by this morning, all power had been restored.” Khumalo further states that a specialised Johannesburg Metro Police Department unit will exclusively focus on copper cable syndicates. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Residents of Umzimkhulu, where Sindiso Magaqa was a ward councillor, have taken to the streets, calling for the municipality to fall. Protesters claim the municipality is in the hands of killers. Magaqa became a councillor after the ANC Youth League was disbanded. He was shot in an ambush in July and died on Monday. The Hawks may investigate allegations of poisoning once the post mortem is complete. Two councillors, who survived the attack say they're working under trying circumstances. Nonsikelelo Mafa and Jabulile Mzizi-Msiya both sustained injuries in that incident. Magaqa - who died as a result of his injuries on Monday - apparently knew his work was risky. "Magaqa used to say: I joined the ANC as a volunteer but I know this is a struggle. Anything can happen to me...just because I'm fighting for my people," says Mzizi-Msiya. "It has been difficult. We were there to fight every day. Fighting for the people to get their service delivery." Although the councillors wouldn't be drawn on internal party issues, they are calling for unity. Mafa says: "This is not right for us. We are the councillors of the ANC. We need to support each other. There is no thing like division but we need to support, not shooting. Let's stop shooting. Let's stop because we are the ANC members, we are the ANC volunteers." There've been no arrests for the shooting.

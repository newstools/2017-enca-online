JOHANNESBURG - Fans of Minnie Dlamini will not just have to rely on social media for glimpses of her impending 'white wedding' on September 16. A three-part documentary special will be broadcast on VUZU AMP from October 13, telling the story of the prenuptial journey and wedding to Quinton Jones. The special will be called Minnie Dlamini: Becoming Mrs Jones. According to M-Net, it is a "candid series (that) documents the ins and outs of the wedding planning process, the elaborate wardrobes, traditional and western cuisine, as the couple traverse South Africa in putting together their special occasion." The documentary will touch on the traditional wedding, which was held in July and end with the white wedding, which M-Net said will show fans the couple's love and commitment to each other. Fans will also get a glimpse of Jones' proposal to Dlamini. #BecomingMrsJones Coming soon on @vuzutv It's NOT a reality show it's a 3part wedding documentary -- pic.twitter.com/7tKjV82tP8 Dlamini said the show is not a reality show. "It’s my journey, told through my eyes, my way. Producing the show helped me maintain control of the creative process throughout. The production is deeply personal and I can’t wait to share it with the country, as I step into my new role of being Mrs Jones.” Reneilwe Sema, M-Net’s Director for Local Entertainment Channels commented on the show, “The Minnie Dlamini special does two great things for our viewers: it takes them on an intimate journey with one of the country’s biggest superstars, in the most personal of situations; and it shows viewers that even the biggest stars face ordinary life challenges, conflicts, and celebrations, just like the rest of us. They share our motivations, aspirations and fears. Seeing Minnie in these sometimes-vulnerable, sometimes-celebratory situations, will surely make for great viewing.” Minnie Dlamini: Becoming Mrs Jones will air on VUZU AMP (DStv channel 103), from Friday, 13 October at 19:00 eNCA

CAPE TOWN The Ajax Cape Town contingent breathed a collective sigh of relief after picking up their first victory of the season with a 2-0 win over Polokwane City at a rainy and cold Cape Town Stadium on Friday evening.THAT WINNING FEELING#WeAreAjaxCT -- pic.twitter.com/1At0UhJCEu; On a night which was generally lacking in open and enterprising football, it proved to be all about the three points for Stanley Menzo s team after what has been a slow start to the season for the Ikamva-based team. After a goal-less first half, Nxumalo took the home side over the line with 70th and 90th-minute strikes. Ajax started the game on the front foot and Polokwane keeper George Chigova did well to keep out Nemukondeni s seventh-minute chance before saving at the feet of Nxumalo in the 14th minute. The Urban Warriors remained on top, but again Chigova did superbly to deny Nemukondeni when he seemed set to put the home side ahead on 28 minutes. FT: Ajax 2-0 Polokwane City A brace by Prince Nxumalo wins it for the hosts.@ajaxcapetown @polokwane_city #PSL pic.twitter.com/r9uqvEBC0EPolokwane looked a more threatening unit in the second half and had chances when Rodney Ramagalela forced a 50th minute save from Brandon Petersen, who also made a comfortable stop on Jabulani Maluleke s shot five minutes later. Having done brilliantly to keep the home side off the score-sheet, it was ironically from his mistake, a dropped cross, that Nxumalo was able to pounce to score 20 minutes from time. Rise and Shine gave Menzo and his men some anxious moments as they stepped up a gear in search of an equaliser and Petersen had to be on top of his game. But nerves were settled in the 90th minute when Nxumalo converted an inviting cross from Rodrick Kabwe to bring some cheer to the loyal supporters who braved the elements in a stormy Mother City.African News Agency

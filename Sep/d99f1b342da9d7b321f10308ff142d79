Sifiso Nkabinde, our first Secretary General, was even killed. He was killed by the ANC mayor’s bodyguards from Richmond. "Fortunately justice was served. We’ve come a long way, we must remain unshaken and move forward. And focus on serving the people of South Africa.” Holomisa said the ANC doesn't stand a chance in the 2019 general elections. “The ANC is beyond redemption. It talks of self-correction as it limps desperately towards December," he said.

When you check the people who vote for us, we have not been exploiting the opportunity. It may appear that we are a black party, not that we regret that, but the vision is that it be home for all and we are determined to expand on that," he said. eNCA

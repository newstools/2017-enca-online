MUNICH - The drinking has begun as wet weather and enhanced security did not dampen the spirits of beer enthusiasts at the 184th Oktoberfest which opened in Munich on Saturday.

Prost! pic.twitter.com/fZS8d6qHq8 Six million people from all over the world are expected to visit the world's largest beer festival, which runs until October 3.This year, visitors will be able to download an app that shows nearby tents with available space. It will also help festival-goers find lost friends -- which will be useful as the largest tent fits 10,000 people.Drinkers will face higher beer prices -- a litre of beer will cost up to 10.95 euros ($13), 25 cents higher than last year when 6.6 million litres of beer were guzzled over the two weeks.Oktoberfest is hoping more people will come to the festival this year after attendance in 2016 dipped in part due to concern over terror attacks.http://www.enca.com/germans-oktoberfest-kicks-barrel-tapOktoberfest is in full swing!

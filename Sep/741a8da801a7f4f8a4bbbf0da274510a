JOHANNESBURG – The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has called on the Hawks to investigate corruption and fraud charges against KPMG executives, including those who stood to benefit from its adverse findings into the so-called South African Revenue Service (SARS) rogue unit. “We are not impressed by the resignation of the nine executives, including its chief executive officer Trevor Hoole as well as chief operating officer and country risk manager Steven Louw. There must be full disclosure of the audit firm’s part in the dirty tricks campaign aimed at discrediting those opposed to state capture,” Sanco national spokesman Jabu Mahlangu said. READ: KPMG should have stopped working with Guptas: CEO The KPMG scandal was an indication of a wider private sector involvement in corruption and other activities that undermined good corporate governance and those that contributed towards credit downgrades by international credit rating agencies. “Unless they are also captured or are narrowly serving the interests of the beneficiaries of institutionalised corruption, state security agencies need to explain to the country why it should still have confidence in them because state capture allegations point to their conspicuous disinterest in protecting the sovereignty and interest of the broader South African public.” Sanco was deeply concerned about the use of state apparatus in dirty political campaigns in the run up to the African National Congress’s December elective conference.
	
	“The fact that state security is missing in action or has turned a blind eye to pertinent issues which should be their preoccupation is encouraging political killings in certain parts of our country, including KwaZulu-Natal,” Mahlangu said. African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) said on Friday that parents of Ho rskool Pretoria West had voted against the proposed amendment to the school code of conduct that would allow learners to wear skinny pants.GDE spokesperson Steve Mabona said in a statement that the parents held a meeting Thursday evening where the decision was made. It is important to note, that teaching and learning continues unhindered at the said school, and as such we plead with learners not to disrupt schooling because that will impact negatively on their future. READ: Learning resumes at Pretoria school following 'pants' issueLast week, schooling was disrupted by learners who were complaining about not being allowed to wear skinny pants as part of their school uniform. We would like to thank the School Governing Body (SGB), for a swift intervention in this regard, Mabona said. Learners are encouraged to use proper channels to raise their grievances, this will eliminate the need for protests and unnecessary disruption of teaching and learning. We wish the learners well in their studies. Gauteng MEC for Education Mr Panyaza Lesufi said: I am encouraged and satisfied with the decision taken by parents, and also wish to encourage other parents to do the same. As parents, we must always take charge of our children s behaviour and empower educators to instill necessary discipline to learners. The day we allow ill-discipline to prevail in our schools, we will all be doomed. Ill-discipline must not be tolerated in our schooling environment. African News Agency

It's been a whirlwind road trip for the EFC Convoy, taking in the sights of the N2 as it leaves behind the wreckage of an awesome 63rd exposition of legislated violence in Cape Town to set the scene up the Dolphin Coast for the 64th. It will be the second time South Africa's premier mixed martial arts promotion visits Durban in 2017. EFC matchmaker Graeme Cartmell joins Simon Stephens to marvel at the testicular fortitude of Wayde Sage, the possibility of Warren Allison taking on France's Alain Baudot, advice on Cameron Pritchard's swift return to winning ways, the array of available bouts for the legend that is Dino Bagattin, mulling over Mazany and the lightweights, the first week of filming on The Fighter, a rundown of Jay Cuccinello and Wesley Hawkey and the November return of the one and only Boyd Allen. And more! Buckle up, this is a wild one.

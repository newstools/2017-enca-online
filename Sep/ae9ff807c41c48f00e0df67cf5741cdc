JOHANNESBURG - Former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, Chief Executive of Nkululeko Leadership Consulting, Nonkululeko Gobodo, and economist Iraj Abedian will take part in a panel discussion on Wednesday looking at what we can learn from the KPMG debacle. The event is being hosted by the Wits Faculty of Commerce, Law, and Management. The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has called on government and business to blacklist KPMG for unethical behaviour.

President Jacob Zuma’s lawyer says he is following the KPMG saga with keen interest. This follows revelations that the investigator behind the now-discredited SARS report also compiled the state’s forensic probe into Zuma. It looks likely that the president's legal team may use questions over the legality of the withdrawn KPMG report on the SARS intelligence unit in their favour as Zuma fights the reinstatement of corruption charges. eNCA

Latif had been charged with breaching six clauses, including the serious offense of luring other players to taker part in fixing.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) provisionally suspended Latif and Sharjeel after they found evidence of spot-fixing during a Pakistan Super League (PSL) match between Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi in Dubai in February.READ: Pakistan celebrates international revival with winThe board said Sharjeel and Latif met an alleged bookie and struck a deal. Based on the plan, Sharjeel -- an aggressive batsman who scores quickly -- agreed to play two dot balls after the first over in the match.Although Latif did not play in that game, he was later charged with luring Sharjeel into the deal and not reporting the matter to the PCB anti-corruption unit.Spot-fixing involves bets on the outcome of a particular passage of play, unlike match-fixing in which there is an attempt to prearrange the result of the match.Both players were suspended provisionally at the time and withdrawn from the PSL.The minimum punishment for the charges which Latif faced was a six-month suspension with a maximum of a life ban.Under the PCB code players can appeal rulings before an independent arbitrator within 14 days of the decision.Four other players -- Mohammad Irfan, Shahzaib Hasan, Nasir Jamshed and Mohammad Nawaz -- were also included in the investigation on multiple charges.READ: Pakistan bans Sharjeel for five years over spot-fixingIrfan and Nawaz admitted not reporting the bookie's offer.

But the pleas were rejected by the court. AFP

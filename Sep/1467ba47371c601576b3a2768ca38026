JOHANNESBURG - The government and its entities should consider reviewing their work programmes with beleaguered auditing firm KPMG to ensure their auditing had not ben compromised, the Finance Ministry said on Friday. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said in a statement that he was deeply concerned about audit matters currently surrounding KPMG. "These developments have created a bad image and have undermined the reputation of good governance and audit independence in one of the key sectors and institutions in our economy. These developments further threaten to undermine our efforts in reinforcing confidence and enhancing a climate for investments, both domestic and international," he said. A week ago KPMG made an about-turn on its 2016 report on the SARS intelligence unit, prompting several companies to end or review their contracts with the auditors. Gigaba said the developments of the past week reaffirmed the ministry's position that there should beÂ mandatory rotation of audit firms.

"It cannot be in the interest of good governance to have one audit firm auditing a company perpetually." Recent developments further highlighted the risks posed by market dominance and concentration of a few firms in key industries. "We call for a concerted effort by all stakeholders to open up the sector to more players for a more deconcentrated and transformed audit sector," the statement said.

It's no coincidence that One Championship are staging three massive events throughout November whilst at the same time announcing a staggering 24-event calendar for 2018. The month of October gives Asia's MMA leviathan much needed downtime in which to plan for Yangon/Manila/Singapore in what is evidently a very ambitious stress-test for its production teams prior to Jakarta on the 20th of January. In fact, it gives the staff just the festive season in which to plug the holes in its albeit world-class logistics machine despite a further three events in December. I spoke to Chairman and CEO of One Championship Chatri Sityodtong in Macau in August about the increase in production capabilities required for such a schedule and he told me that they have been pre-planning and bolstering facilities throughout 2017 in anticipation of the agressive expansion plans facilitated by the Sequioa investment deal. It's evident that 2018 is going to be the biggest year in the history of One Championship as it returns to the Indonesian capital that it departed just last week in Total Victory. In this week's episode we bring you all the highlights from Jakarta and look ahead to #OneMonth of incredible action in November and preview the rematch beween Mei Yamaguchi and Angela Lee, two athletes who last year put on THE greatest bout in the history of women's MMA. They meet again in Singapore on the 24th of November for a rerun of history in the aptly named Immortal Pursuit where Ben Askren will take his final bow against the legendary Tobikan Judan, Shinya Aoki.

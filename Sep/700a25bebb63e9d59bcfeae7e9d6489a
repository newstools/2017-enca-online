JOHANNESBURG It looks as if Durban s notorious gang leader Sandile Chillies Bhengu was living large.Bhengu, whose memorial service had social media abuzz with videos of spinning cars and gun-wielding men shooting volleys of bullets in the air, was killed in a shoot-out with police, allegedly after being caught removing a tracker from a stolen vehicle in Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal.This video, posted by Bhengu's fans on social media, is rife with speculation that his funeral is going to be used to settle scores and will feature a drag race with stolen vehicles. eNCA

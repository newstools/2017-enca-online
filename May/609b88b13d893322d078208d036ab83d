WASHINGTON - The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday made no change in the benchmark interest rate and downplayed recent weak economic growth, a signal it likely will remain on course for gradual rate hikes.The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep the federal funds lending rate in a range of 0.75-1.0 percent, just as most analysts had expected.AFP

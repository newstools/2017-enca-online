JOHANNESBURG - There was no evidence to link a man to the murder of two women who were found in different locations in Soweto, the National Prosecuting Authority said.Initially, it was reported that three men were arrested for the murders, but the NPA has confirmed that only one man had been arrested.Two of the slain women who have been identified by family and friends on social media are Bongeka Phungula (28) and Popi Qwabe (24). The NPA in the Protea magistrate's court refused to place the murder docket of Bongeka and Popi on the roll as there is no evidence that links the arrested suspect at this stage, which means that the docket did not meet the minimum requirements for a matter to be placed on the roll, NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said. The NPA has instructed the investigating officer to conduct certain investigations. Once concluded, the docket must be brought back to the NPA for a decision.

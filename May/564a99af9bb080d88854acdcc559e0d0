JOHANNESBURG SA Under-20 coach Thabo Senong, says despite losing their first two matches of the FIFA U20 World Cup, they can still bounce back and beat Uruguay.Amajita and the South Americans face off in the last group stages match on Saturday, at Incheon Football Stadium, Korea Republic in an 8pm (1pm SA time) local kickoff time.Senong s charges are yet to register a win after two games, while Uruguay is flying high with six points following two victories.South Africa lost 2-1 to Japan in their opening match, before going down 2-0 to Italy.Amajita is at the bottom of the table while Uruguay is leading the pack. Uruguay is a hard side to beat but it is not impossible. We have been working hard on how to deal with them and I have strong belief that they boys will deliver as expected because we have emphasised to them that they are worthy of being in the World Cup, said Senong. We are all aware it will be a tough day at the office but we have to play for pride. That is why I believe they will come out strongly against Uruguay. As matters stand, our World Cup run has come to an end but it doesn t mean we have to make things easy for the opposition we are going there to fight for victory. It would be a great morale booster for the boys confidence if we were to get a win, especially against a high-riding team like Uruguay. It is a fact that the last two results derailed our plans, but it s all in the past we have to focus on what s ahead of us. I am confident we will do well. African News Agency

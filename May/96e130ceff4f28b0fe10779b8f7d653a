CAPE TOWN - It appears that most of the injuries sustained by Henri van Breda on the day his parents and brother were murdered with an axe could have been self-inflicted.This is according to the testimony of a forensic pathologist in his murder trial in the Western Cape High Court.She also testified that his sister, Marli, had suffered injuries to her wrists, which created the impression that she tried to defend herself.A policeman also testified that Van Breda s fingerprint was found on a knife linked to the crime.According to Van Breda s version, he was stabbed by the attacker.READ: Officer in Van Breda case accused of misleading courtSergeant Jonathan Oliphant testified that he found 53 usable fingerprints in the Van Breda house.

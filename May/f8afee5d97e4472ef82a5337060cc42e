JOHANNESBURG - If a country s electricity consumption is a reliable barometer of its economic health SA s economy has declined by up to 20% over the past decade.The good news in the Statistics SA monthly report on electricity generated and available for distribution released on Thursday is that the economy rebounded 11% from February to March judging from its total power bill.The bad news is that this takes its decline from an economic peak reached in July 2007 from 20% in February to 10.7% in March.Stats SA reports that its electricity volume index which was set to 100 in 2015 rebounded to 102.2 points in March from 92.1 points in February. The index reached a peak of 114.4 points in July 2007 before Eskom s load shedding woes set in.READ: Nearly 90 percent of SA households have electricity, says EskomDemand for power tends to be higher in mid-winter and the index reached 112.9 points in July 2008 before rolling blackouts caused it to crash to a nadir of 86.8 points in February 2009.Measured in gigawatt-hours (GWh) rather than index points the July 2007 power peak equated to 23 801GWh. Much as Eskom likes to crow that it has resolved SA s load shedding crisis peak demand in July 2016 was 22 520GWh 5.4% lower than 10 years ago.A sharp decline in SA s economy following the load shedding crisis is borne out by other Stats SA releases. For instance according to its manufacturing volume index SA s factory output reached a peak of 125.9 points in October 2007 a level manufacturers managed to sustain the following month.The load-shedding crisis saw this index plunge to 82.7 in January 2009 and it has only limped back to 100.1 points in Stats SA s most recent report for February 2017.The bleak picture of the damage done to SA s economy by load shedding is also echoed in Stats SA s quarterly utilisation of production capacity report also released on Thursday. In the fourth quarter of 2007 before electricity became unreliable due to Eskom s problems utilisation was at 86.6%. During the height of load shedding in the third quarter of 2009 utilisation fell to 77.4%.READ: Good news on electricityThe report shows utilisation in the first quarter of 2017 was 80.8% or 6.3 percentage points lower than prior to load shedding.The textile clothing and footwear industry appears to be suffering most with 72.8% utilisation of production capability. The clothing sector also showed the sharpest annual decline in utilisation of 2.2 percentage points.Of the 10 types of manufacturing segments Stats SA gives utilisation figures for only two showed improvements from the first quarter of 2016: paper and furniture producers.Glass manufacturers suffered a 1.6 percentage point decline to 79.4% utilisation and falling vehicle sales contributed to car factory utilisation declining 1.2 percentage points to 82.4%.Hidden in these figures is the enormous damage a four-fold increase in electricity prices along with unreliable supply has done to SA s economy over the past decade.iNet Bridge

I have felt angry and isolated," he said in a statement issued by the international professional players' association FIFPro."I was being treated like a criminal. How could I be punished when I was the victim of racism?"There were no sanctions for Cagliari, however, the league ruling that the racist chanting came from "about 10 people, or less than one percent of the sector" of the stadium.Muntari added: "I hope my case can help so that other footballers do not suffer like me. I hope it can be a turning point in Italy and show the world what it means to stand up for your rights."This is an important victory to send a message that there s no place for racism in football, or society in general."

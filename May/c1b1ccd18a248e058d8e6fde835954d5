"It was perfect, I am super-happy," said Kohler."This one is really special."Asked if he would like to see the records wiped out, the German said he would "support" anything that ensures a clean sport.American double Olympic gold-medallist triple jumper, Christian Taylor, secured victory with a last round jump of 17.25m, to deny compatriot Omar Craddock.AFP

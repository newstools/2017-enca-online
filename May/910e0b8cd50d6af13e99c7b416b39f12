MANCHESTER Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho had no influence over the decision to excuse Marcus Rashford from duty at the Under-21 European Championship, England manager Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday.Southgate has frequently underlined the importance of giving young players tournament experience, but he called Rashford into his senior squad, rather than let him play at next month's Under-21 Euro in Poland.READ: United ranked as Europe's most valuable clubMourinho had expressed reservations about Rashford going to Poland, but Southgate said the decision to call the 19-year-old up for England's forthcoming games against Scotland and France was his and his alone."I didn't speak to him (Mourinho) about it," Southgate, the former England Under-21 manager, told journalists at St George's Park in Burton upon trent, central England."Marcus's evolution this season has been clear in terms of the responsibility he's had at his club."And when I've watched matches like the game away at Chelsea in the cup when he was playing on his own (up front) for long periods of the game, the game against Chelsea at Old Trafford, the European matches, quarter-finals and semi-finals, where he had such a big impact in big games, he should be in our squad. The only decision for me was, do we send him to both?"Southgate added: "The key for us is not the relationship with Jose; it's the relationship with Marcus."And making sure that he senses that we're not just plonking him somewhere to try to achieve an objective that ticks a box for us."We're very serious about development tournaments, but whenever we're dealing with young players, we've also got to be serious about their own personal development as well."Because he's got huge potential and we've got to handle him in the right way to try and get him where we want him long-term."READ: Rooney close to decision on futureAsked if Mourinho had put any pressure on him over Rashford, Southgate replied: "I've not spoken to him about it, but I'm not in a position where I can make decisions to keep people happy."I'm not going to achieve that. If I'm trying to keep Jose happy, that's going to be, let's say, fairly difficult."Respectfully, none of the managers are going to be around in 10 years - or (are) very, very unlikely (to be) - and I think people like Marcus Rashford will be. I think that his relationship with England is key."AFP

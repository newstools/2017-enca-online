CAIRO - Egypt held a sombre ceremony on the first anniversary of the EgyptAir MS804 disaster in Cairo Friday, but no answers were forthcoming on why the flight crashed into the Mediterranean killing all passengers on board. In loving memory #MS804 19 May 2016 will remain in our hearts forever. #EGYPTAIR pic.twitter.com/E3owYJUQUxDuring the ceremony at Cairo airport, relatives of the victims laid flowers at the foot of a memorial wall bearing the names of all 66 passengers and crew killed when the Airbus A320 flying from Paris to Cairo crashed.The ceremony came two weeks after a source close to the French investigation ruled out that explosives caused the crash, contradicting Egyptian investigators who had said explosive traces were found on the victims' bodies.

There are no conclusions," he said."We will present the conclusions we have at the appropriate time."In December, an official Egyptian investigative committee had said it found traces of explosives on victims' remains, but French officials at the time refused to draw conclusions on the cause of the accident.

Ramaphosa said his comments while director of Lonmin were not an instruction to police.READ: Ramaphosa apologises for Marikana emailsAnd now almost five years later, he's willing to meet the families of those who died.The EFF's Floyd Shivambu asked Ramaphosa who exactly he was apologising to, since the deputy president made the comments while he was in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape on Sunday."Why are you not going to apologise in Marikana so that the people who were affected will receive the apology," Shivambu asked.Ramphosa responded that he would visit Marikana accompanied by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela at some future date as it was her idea that he accompany her to the area."Madikizela-Mandela raised it publicly. I want to take you to Marikana. She will lead me, she will advise... I am prepared to meet the widows of those workers who were killed and the widows of all 44 people who were killed. As a leader I'm prepared to be accountable and prepared to confront any situation where accountability is required," Ramphosa said."I apologised honourable Shivambu for the language I used. I did say I used inappropriate language as expressed in the emails, but what I was dealing with was to try and stop further killings and for me this was sparked off... by the killing of the 10 people who died and that happened in the most gruesome manner."I said it could never be that I would want to have mine workers killed or anybody for that matter in the way that it all happened."Ramaphosa also faced questions ranging from the performance of municipalities, the so-called intelligence report purportedly used by President Jacob Zuma to reshuffle his cabinet, and whether he believes MPs should be allowed to vote with their conscience in the upcoming vote of no confidence in President Zuma.The vote of no confidence is expected to be scheduled once the Constitutional Court has ruled on whether MPs are allowed to vote using a secret ballot system.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - The SABC's Chief Financial Officer  James Aguma has been suspended. The ANC in Parliament said it welcomes the suspension of Aguma. The broadcaster also announced that Tseliso Ralitabo, the group executive for media, technology and infrastructure would stand in as the new group CEO. "At this stage, the SABC can unfortunately not reveal any further details due to internal processes," spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said in a statement. “This suspension follows a recent recommendation by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts that he be placed on suspension while the Interim SABC Board conducts its forensic investigation into irregularities in procurement and expenditure at the SABC,” said Mnyamezeli Booi, chairperson for the ANC Study Group on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). “We are confident of the efforts by the Interim SABC Board in their commitment of restoring good governance and public confidence in our public broadcaster.” READ: MPs call for SABC’s Aguma to be disciplined Earlier this month Communications Minister Ayanda Dlolo briefed Parliament's Scopa, saying Aguma was off sick. It's been reported that Aguma gave former CEO Hlaudi Motsoeneng permission to hold a media briefing in April. Motsoeneng made scathing remarks about the broadcaster's new board and said he would survive a disciplinary hearing. eNCA

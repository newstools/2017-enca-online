JOHANNESBURG - Travellers are no longer looking to South Africa as a destination for only scenic landscapes.

If you're going to be sick, you'd rather be sick where you can see beautiful scenery.}If you are an actor or a singer or even a president and you're suffering from stress you wouldn't want people from your country to know, so you go to a foreign country."Watch the video above for the full story.eNCA

It will include the features of its other Echo devices along with video shown on a seven-inch touchscreen."With Echo Show, customers can watch video flash briefings and YouTube, and see music lyrics, smart home cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, and more," said a blog post from Amazon developer anc chief evangelist for Echo devices David Isbitski.Users will also be able to call or message others who also have an Echo or the Alexa application.Last month the US online giant began selling its Echo Look gadget, which includes the voice-activated assistant but with a camera, allowing Alexa to offer fashion advice.Amazon's latest hardware foray comes after limited success with its Kindle and Fire tablets, but also a failure for its Fire smartphones.The new Echo Show "looks like a lot of other products that have been launched in the past," said analyst Avi Greengart of Current Analysis in a tweet. "Unlike those, it will sell."Ian Fogg of the research firm IHS Markit said on Twitter: "What's most interesting about #Echo Show is the extent it is different & enhanced from simply a combination of Echo + Fire tablet."More optionsJan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said the new device adds additional features to the Alexa family by giving consumers a screen option."I don't think all voice assistants need to have screens, but Amazon is wise to give people the option," Dawson said in a blog post."What we're seeing is Amazon using its smart original foray into and early dominance of this space as a beachhead to spread into lots of other areas."But Dawson echoed comments made by other observers that the Echo Show "isn't attractive.""If there's one area where Amazon's various bits of hardware have always struggled, it's design," he said."There's no real consistency or style, and as I said last week, this thing looks like a miniature version of one of those old massive tube TVs."

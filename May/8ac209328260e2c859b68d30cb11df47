 CAPE TOWN - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini is adamant her department can't take over grant payments in 10 months time.Dlamini appeared before Parliament on Wednesday morning to brief its members on the social grant payment issue. WATCH: Sassa updates Parliament on grants paymentsThe fact that Sassa (Social Services Agency) was created to payout pensions and we did not start with that, says there was already a challenge of staff that could not do some of the things that you were supposed to be doing if you are an agency that is supposed to be paying out grants," the minister said.The department of social development has come under fire following its failure to terminate a contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to distribute 17 million social grants to 10 million beneficiaries.The Constitutional Court declared that contract invalid and later extended Sassa's contract with CPS for one year. eNCA

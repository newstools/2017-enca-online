That would be ill-advised and cast the criminal justice system in a bad light," he said.Only RTs for @nickopiyo and @Bwesigye pic.twitter.com/uRBV3RBveqOutside the court, police arrested four protesting university students who were calling for Nyanzi's release.Last week, US ambassador Deborah Malac mentioned Nyanzi's case in a speech on World Press Freedom Day."Dr Nyanzi's case shows that... constitutional rights and freedoms apparently have limits, particularly when those opinions are critical of the country s leaders," she said.Ugandan government spokesman Ofwono Opondo condemned the ambassador s comments and compared Nyanzi's case to the treatment of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange by US authorities."Though Uganda continues to uphold freedom of expression as guaranteed by our constitution, the government shall apprehend and prosecute those involved in suspected criminal transgressions in all its forms," said Opondo.AFP

The #Ennerdale community also feels ignored by the provincial government, they say there've been many unkept promises. “Last year we had [Gauteng Human Settlements MEC] Paul Mashatile out here ... he promised the community that he’s going to build houses, that they’re going to allocate land to the people, and nothing has been happening ever since last year. “There was no promises that were fulfilled. So the community is tired of having these people come out here and make empty promises, and they’re not delivering on the promises.” We're in #Ennerdale service delivery protest.Police using rubber bullets to push back protesters.Protesters hv been fighting back with rocks pic.twitter.com/63f2Knx81w READ: Protests erupt in Ennerdale Cass says they want Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba to address them personally and listen to their demands. “We as a community of Ennerdale have given them enough time,” she said. “The problem is not at his offices, the problem is a community problem. The mayor needs to come here to come and address, and to come and tell us what the way forward is. “They’re sitting high up in the offices, and they are doing nothing for the people here down on the ground.” Protesters approaching police, hands in the air. #Ennerdale pic.twitter.com/azzuJOIRwt eNCA

LUSAKA Zambia heads to the 2017 FIFA Under-20 World Cup in South Korea with high expectations after a memorable last six months for the team.The Under-20 World Cup in South Korea gets under way on Saturday and Zambia along with Guinea, Senegal and South Africa will represent Africa.Under the guidance of Beston Chambeshi, who is basking in the great success in his first national team assignment in over two decades after stints with domestic sides Nkana, Power Dynamos (where he won the 2011 league title), Konkola Blades. He is currently coach of Lumwana Radiants.The 56-year-old ex-Zambia international midfielder has also coached in Botswana, notably Botswana Defence Force XI and Mochudi Centre Chiefs, steering the latter to a domestic double in 2008.Chambeshi leads Zambia to South Korea as continental champions, after beating Senegal 2-0 in the final on home soil last March.The feat came just two months after the Junior Chipolopolo emerged winners of the regional COSAFA Under-20 Cup in South Africa.They swept all before them at the regional championship, winning all their six games and beating hosts South Africa 2-1 in the final on December 11 in Rustenburg.Chambeshi now heads to the FIFA World Cup where Zambia will be making their third-ever appearance after 1999 (in Nigeria) and 2007 (in Canada). We are going there to compete and not going there to make the numbers, Chambeshi said.The Southern Africans are housed in Group C where they will face Iran, Costa Rica and Portugal, teams they will be facing for the first time at this level. The draw is tough but it is not like there are easy games at this level. We qualified for the World Cup so we are as good as any other team. Portugal is a good team but this is a competition we just have to be prepared then we can beat any team, said midfielder Enock Mwepu. We want to do better for our country. We will do our best after all we are African champions, added the NAPSA Stars player.Interestingly, Zambia has had a sneak preview of South Korea in their pre-tournament preparations. Chambeshi and his team took part in a Four-nation tournament where they faced fellow finalists Honduras, Ecuador and hosts South Korea earlier this year.Zambia beat Ecuador 2-0 in their opening game on March 25 thanks to goals from Mwepu and Edward Chilufya.They later lost 4-1 to South Korea two days later, their first defeat in a competitive outing after 13 successive victories since the team was constituted in August last year. Chilufya was again on target with Zambia consolation goal in that match.But Junior Chipolopolo bounced back in their final game with a 4-1 win over Honduras on March 30 in a match Mwepu scored a brace while Chilufya and Emmanuel Banda scored a goal each.Zambia went on to finish runner-up behind host South Korea on goal difference after tieing on six points at the round-robin eventThe African champions later held a long training camp in Spain in May en route to Jeju where they will play their Group C matches.This will be Zambia s second stint in Spain following a two-week camp they held there in early February to prepare for their successful Under-20 AFCON campaign.Salzburg striker Patson Daka is expected to lead Zambia s charge in South Korea. The 19-year old Austria -based striker has shown he is a winner scoring four goals at the continental championship and two at the regional COSAFA U-20 tournament.He recently inspired Salzburg to win 2016/2017 UEFA Youth Cup, scoring in the final 2-1 win over Benfica of Portugal on April 24.Another name to look out for is striker Fashion Sakala of Spartak Moscow in Russia who scored three goals as the Junior Chipolopolo romped to the African title.His ex-club mate at defending champions Zanaco, goalkeeper Mangani Banda, who conceded just two goals at the African championship, is another notable standout in the team.Not to be left out is striker Edward Chilufya who is blessed with a scoring touch from both open play and dead-ball situations which netted four goals at the Under-20 AFCON.

JOHANNESBURG – Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking in his role as Southern African Development Community (SADC) facilitator, says Lesotho is ready to hold a snap election next month. King Letsie the Third dissolved parliament in March after Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili lost a no-confidence vote. His support base was weakened by a string of defections from his coalition government. The election, schedule for 3 June, is the second snap poll in three years. Thabane: Lesotho army has no role in government The previous one was held in 2015, following a coup attempt in 2014. “My discussions with a number of stakeholders told me that indeed they are ready and prepared to roll-out the democratic process and go to elections once again. I also had extensive discussions with all role players about the decisions of the SADC troika, which decided that there should be a multiparty, multi stakeholder dialogue. Ideally before the elections,” said Ramaphosa. “As things have turned it seems impossible to hold it before the elections, because the elections are within three weeks’ time.” eNCA

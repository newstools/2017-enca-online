BERLIN - Borussia Dortmund's head coach Thomas Tuchel has left the club, the Bundesliga side confirmed Tuesday, denying that the departure was sparked by a public spat with the club's chief executive."We thank Thomas Tuchel and his training staff for their successful work at BVB," said the club, adding that the "cause of the separation is by no means a disagreement between two people".Relations between Tuchel and chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke have become publicly strained since a bomb attack on the Dortmund team bus on April 11.Three explosive devices hidden in a hedge went off next to the team bus as it left the squad's hotel heading for a Champions League quarter-final match at home against Monaco, wounding Spanish international Marc Bartra, 26, and a motorcycle police officer.READ: PSG poised to table bid for AubameyangTuchel had complained that neither he nor his shell-shocked players were consulted on the decision to go ahead with the match against Monaco less than 24 hours after the attack.But Watzke denied that was the case and said the claim had annoyed him.In a statement, the club sought to play down the row, saying that "the well-being of the Borussia Dortmund club... is always more important than individuals or possible differences between them".It added that it would not go into details about the reason for the separation.With a year left on his contract, Tuchel's departure reportedly includes a separation payment of around 2.5 million euros ($2.7m).His exit came just three days after Dortmund won the German Cup in Saturday's final against Eintracht Frankfurt.It was Tuchel's first title in his two years in charge.READ: Rampant Bayern win fifth straight German league titleHe has been shown the despite finishing third this season in Germany's top tier to qualify for the Champions League."I am very grateful for two beautiful, eventful and exciting years.

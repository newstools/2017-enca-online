He notched up his personal best of 8.65m in April. I am pleased to win again, said Manyonga. My success has been down to hard work, training, dedication and commitment. I hope now to just go on and win everything I can this season. The track was really fast and that made it difficult, he added. I did a few fouls and that was a distraction.

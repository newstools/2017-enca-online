JOHANNESBURG - The ANC is blaming Cosatu for the embarrassing end to its main Workers' Day rally in Bloemfontein.President Jacob Zuma was heckled and prevented from speaking on Monday, and eventually left when Cosatu cancelled all speeches.ANC Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa says the trade union federation should not have publicly endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for ANC president ahead of the year-end elective conference.Kodwa insists the tripartite alliance is not under threat.Kodwa lamented the fact that the significance of Workers Day was overshadowed by disruptions at many rallies around the country.ANC leaders were also booed at Cosatu May Day rallies in Durban and Polokwane."I think it s regrettable and unfortunate that this day, the significance has been reduced to personality cults, to preference of leadership," Kodwa said.While the ANC says it has no regrets about President Zuma attending Cosatu's rally in Bloemfontein, at least one analyst believes the President and the governing party underestimated the effect his presence would have at the country s main Workers Day' event.They were arrogant enough to think it was safe territory, said Political Commentator, Susan Booysen. eNCA

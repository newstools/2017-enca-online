DURBAN A small South African sprint team will contest the first ICF Canoe Sprint World Cup in Montemor-0-Velho, Portugal this weekend as South African sprinter paddlers start the long-term process of qualifying for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.The South African contingent will be made up by Chrisjan Coetzee and Esti van Tonder, both of whom performed well in the recent South African sprint championships at Shongweni Dam and Sprint Committee Chairman Craig Mustard is positive the two can produce good results.Mustard stressed that there are a number of factors that have led to such a small contingent travelling to Portugal, however he is confident that when the World Championships in Ra ice in August the squad will be larger. This year s team is one of the smallest I have ever been on with only Esti van Tonder and Chrisjan Coetzee attending, Mustard said. The biggest reason for this is that the cost of the World Cups makes it really difficult for paddlers to attend both of these World Cup events and then again later this year to travel to Europe for the world champs. This coupled with a number of athletes having to fulfil university commitments; it makes it difficult to leave for two weeks. Esti was in really brilliant form at the selections earlier this year and Chrisjan is also racing now the 500m and 200m and not just the 200m. Looking just at the numbers I believe the World Cup 1 will deliver Looking just at the numbers I believe the World Cup 1 will deliver our best results and we are hoping that these two seasoned athletes will be able to deliver some strong results. With the new Olympic cycle comes new races that will form part of the 2020 Olympic Games. Women s C1 and C2 race will replace the men s K2 200 and C1 200m, while the men s K4 1 000 will become a 500m race.Racing begins on Friday with the heats and then finishes on Sunday with the A Finals.

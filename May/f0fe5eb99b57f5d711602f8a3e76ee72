JOHANNESBURG - A dodgy intelligence report may take centre stage this week as the deadline approaches for President Jacob Zuma to explain why he fired Pravin Gordhan from the Finance Ministry.At the time of the Cabinet reshuffle, it was alleged the report showed Gordhan had been conspiring with foreign forces.The authenticity of the dossier is yet to be confirmed.If it's true, Gordhan could face treason charges.If not, it may lend credence to the argument Zuma acted irrationally during the reshuffle.READ: SACP lashes out at Zuma over 'fake' report - read it hereZuma was widely expected to reshuffle his cabinet one final time during his second term, but the reasons provided for replacing Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, are at the heart of the DA s legal challenge.It emerged that Zuma presented the so-called intelligence report to the ANC s top six leaders as the basis for axing his two most senior finance officials.Gordhan dismissed the report as "absolute nonsense," but Zuma stuck to his story, citing the report and a breakdown in the relationship between himself and Gordhan. It led to divisions within the ANC s senior leadership being laid bare.READ: Mbete knows why Zuma axed GordhanEven Zuma s own intelligence minister, David Mahlobo, all but disowned the report.This has all lead to questions around the rationality of the president s decision.The authenticity of the intelligence dossier could become clearer this week if and when Zuma provides reasons for his decision to the DA, as ordered by the High Court.eNCA

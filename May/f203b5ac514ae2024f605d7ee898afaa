COLIGNY The Coligny Magistrate s Court heard on Tuesday that two farmers, accused of murdering a teenage boy, handed themselves over to police after warrants for their arrests were issued.Local businessman Pieter Karsten, testifying in Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte's urgent bail application, said it was not because of pressure from protests allegedly sparked by the murder. The two did not hand themselves to the police because there was no warrant of arrest issued against them and a case against them was not opened.

You must engage me as a politician, don't bring my family and I will not bring yours too, I'm not that cheap, " Gigaba said in responding to EFF's Floyd Shivambu's questions.Shivambu asked Gigaba to clarify what advice his wife gave him when he was the Minister of Home Affairs and whether or not she'd be advising him in his new role.eNCA

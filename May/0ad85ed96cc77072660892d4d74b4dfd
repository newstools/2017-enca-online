JOHANNESBURG - The ANC has acknowledged attempts to stop members discussing the leaders they would like to elect in December, are futile. The party's National Executive Committee (NEC) says the organisation is gripped by election fever.It's now breaking with tradition, and allowing members to openly discuss names of leaders they want.But potential candidates are not allowed to openly declare their availability yet.WATCH: 'Not about removing one man, it's about dislodging the ANC': MantasheNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa are seen as the frontrunners to replace President Jacob Zuma at the elective conference.But several other leaders are believed to be angling for the top post."The NEC agreed that we should continue discussing the principles that should guide election of leadership in the ANC, but allow the structures of the ANC to start discussing the names," said ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe."Such discussions should be based on the principles discussed and through the eye of the needle. Nominations will only be opened in September 2017."eNCA

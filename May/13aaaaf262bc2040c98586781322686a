JOHANNESBURG - Karabo Mokoena has been remembered as a bold woman. Her sister Bontle Mokoena was speaking at her funeral in Diepkloof, Soweto. An emotional Bontle struggled to speak. Karabo's charred body was found in Lyndhurst on 29 April, a day after she was reported missing. Her boyfriend Sandile Mantsoe is facing charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. #RIPKaraboMokoena pic.twitter.com/HRJ9lds9IS #KaraboMokoena is laid to rest. pic.twitter.com/Boj54cnXws #KaraboMokoena's parents and siblings. pic.twitter.com/ecbgcQ7FQO #KaraboMokoena tombstone unveiled.

Tax matters by their very nature are matters that pertain to the taxpayer and the Sars, that then creates problem for us to give details , Tsholanku said, indicating that because engagements between the revenue service and taxpayers were confidential, he could not provide details.Tsholanku said because the matter involves complex processes such as audits, it would not be resolved overnight. By their very nature, they are complicated. It s difficult to say when you conduct an audit what you will find. Our auditors are working as fast as they can , he said.African National Congress MP Mnyami Booi was not happy with this answer, telling Sars not to transgress and undermine us . You are turning us into a laughing stock. Last year, National Treasury determined Zuma had to pay back R7.8 million for non-security upgrades to his Nkandla homestead in KwaZulu-Natal after the Constitution Court found he was liable to pay back a portion of the R250 million spent on non-security improvements.In addition, Zuma would have to pay tax on fringe benefits he accrued as result of the upgrades.African News Agency

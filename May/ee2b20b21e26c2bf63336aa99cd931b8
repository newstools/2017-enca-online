He deemed it necessary for good governance but also to protect the name of the power utility," he said.Now that Molefe was being reinstated, "we are battling with the perception and the reality of rampant corruption. And without even conclusively dealing with those issues, it does not help the ANC but also damages our effort to fight corruption." Kodwa said.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe reiterated the party's disappointment with the move, saying: "I would think that it is a joke -- you take a person you put him into Parliament and within three months take him out of Parliament. That makes a joke of him and a joke of the ANC". Advertising a job in February March.

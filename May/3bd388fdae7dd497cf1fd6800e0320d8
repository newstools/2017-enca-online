CAPE TOWN - Two months into its six-month term, the interim board of the embattled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has implemented a raft of measures to keep the broadcaster afloat, MPs were told on Tuesday.Briefing the portfolio committee on communications, interim board chairwoman Khanyisile Kweyama said the board had taken to heart and already started implementing recommendations by a parliamentary inquiry, which dissolved the former board and highlighted serious problems with the way public money was being wasted.Kweyama, who was appointed to the board in March along with four others, said the board and the Special Investigating Unit were conducting internal forensic investigations into various contracts at the broadcaster. Those that did not add value would be cancelled.In addition, those guilty of procuring goods and services deemed as wasteful would face the music. To this end, the board as early as this week, has formed a task team that will engage with the SIU on conducting a forensic audit on fraudulent and wasteful expenditure between April 2012 and March 2017.

As an interim board, we are committed to building a culture that will ensure that journalists adhere to credibility, professional standards and a culture that is designed to protect journalists against intimidation. Last year, several journalists were fired for questioning dubious editorial decisions including a ban on airing footage of violent protests.The journalists later told a parliamentary inquiry that they had continued to receive death threats.African News Agency

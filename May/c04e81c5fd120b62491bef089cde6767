JOHANNESBURG - A report by Adams and Adams into the roof collapse at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital found the collapse was caused by stockpiling of crushed stone.Gauteng's MEC of Infrastructure Development, Jacob Mamabolo received the report that he commissioned immediately after the roof collapsed.READ: Contractors blamed for Charlotte Maxeke roof collapseThe report, prepared by Adams & Adams Attorneys assisted by engineering firm Aurecon, contains an assessment of the cause of the incident as well as legal advice on who should be held liable for the damages caused.The roof gave way whilst contractors were waterproofing parts of the hospital's roof during maintenance. Aurecon found that roof over the entrance foyer of the hospital collapsed because of severe overloading due to the stockpiling of crushed stone."The crushed stone was moved to the roof as part of the execution of the waterproofing contract and is specifically provided for in the project specification," the department's statement said."The intention was for the crushed stone to be removed from the platform roofs, as the new waterproofing was not going to be covered by crushed stone. The crushed stone was stockpiled (instead of being taken off the roof through a chute that had been erected for that purpose) on the roof above the entrance foyer of the hospital. The excessive load created as a result caused the roof to collapse."The MEC noted the legal advice contained in the report, that it was the contractor s responsibility to ensure that the project was executed safely and without causing any harm or damage to property.The province would take necessary steps to hold those responsible to account for the damage caused to the hospital and the injuries caused. The MEC has further instructed the legal department to start the necessary processes as soon as possible.A review of the processes leading to the appointment of contractors was also instituted and will be concluded as a matter of urgency. eNCA

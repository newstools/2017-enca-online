MATOSINHOS, Portugal - Four-time world champion Sebastien Ogier stormed closer to a record-equalling fifth triumph at the Rally of Portugal on Saturday, turning an overnight five-second deficit into a 16-second advantage ahead of the final day.Ogier won in Portugal in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 and would emulate Markku Alen's record of five victories in the rally should he win on Sunday.

I m happy with the gap I have but we still have to push tomorrow as Thierry will fight to the end."The French driver had been third overnight as M-Sport teammate Ott Tanak led Sordo by 4.6sec.But Tanak's hopes of a maiden win in the championship evaporated when his car was damaged in a collision with a bank.AFP

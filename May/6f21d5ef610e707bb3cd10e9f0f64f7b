NEW DELHI - India's Shashank Manohar will stay on as chairman of the International Cricket Council until the end of his elected term in June 2018, the game's world governing body said Wednesday.Manohar, who resigned from his post citing "personal reasons" in March, was coaxed to stay on until the board met in April to vote on a series of major reforms.As chairman he spearheaded a broad restructuring of the body aimed at curbing the dominance of cricket's wealthiest nations -- India, Australia and England -- since being appointed ICC boss last year.READ: India's Manohar quits as ICC chairmanHis efforts came to fruition last month when the ICC overwhelming endorsed a plan to more equitably share revenue among all members -- a decision that cost India a large chunk of its funding.The restructure -- described by Manohar as "another step forward for world cricket" -- was agreed in principle in February by the majority of Test playing nations, including England and Australia, but was opposed by India.The Board of Control for Cricket in India stands to lose $277 million (R3.7 billion) in revenue over the next eight years under the changes, with more flowing to minor Test nations and associate members like Ireland and Afghanistan.India resisted naming its Champions Trophy squad in protest, missing a key deadline and threatening to pull out of the tournament in England, but relented and named a side this week.The new financial plan and governance structure will be ratified at the ICC's annual conference in June.African News Agency

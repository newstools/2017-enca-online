CAPE TOWN Ajax Cape made it three league wins on the trot with a fairly comfortable 2-0 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic at the Athlone Stadium on Saturday night.The game was to be settled by two goals in the opening 20 minutes by the Urban Warriors. Celtic were to enjoy most of the play after that, but they wasted a host of chances to get back into the match and remain just three points above the relegation zone with two matches to play.The Urban Warriors were ahead after just three minutes when some great interplay between Ayanda Makua and Bantu Mzwakali put Prince Nxumalo in on goal, the striker doing well to go around goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb before scoring cleverly on the angle.The lead was extended in the 19th minute when Nxumalo turned provider by unselfishly returning Mzwakali s pass for the latter to tap into an empty net after having instigated the move with a surging run through midfield.Celtic had chances to reduce the deficit, but Fiston Abduol s volley was well-saved by Brandon Peterson before Lyle Lakay blazed a shot into the stands on 30 minutes.The Free State team had a couple of more sniffs at goal before half time, but were not really able to pose much of a threat against an Ajax side happy to sit back on their lead.More opportunities were squandered by Phunya Sele Sele after the break as Abduol and then Alfred Ndengane both sent headers just wide of the mark. There was also chance for Celtic striker Ayanda Dlamini midway through the second half, but he failed to test Peterson.Deon Hotto should have done better when he dragged an effort an 83rd minutes wide before Lantshene Phalane went agonisingly close three minutes from time in what proved to be the last chance on a frustrating night for the Bloemfontein club.African News Agency

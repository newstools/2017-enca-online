JOHANNESBURG A 29-member national Preparation Squad has been announced by Athletics South Africa for the IAAF World Under-18 Youth Championships in Nairobi, Kenya on July 12-16.The squad consists of 16 boys and 13 girls.While only 11 athletes in total have achieved the required criteria for selection to the final team, the other 18 squad members have all shown promise in their individual attempts to meet the necessary marks.Though a number of athletes have either qualified or are close to qualifying in more than one event, IAAF rules prevent youth from competing in multiple disciplines over 400m and further.So, the likes of versatile one-lap prospect Sokwakhana Zazini will need to choose a specialty.The final national team for the biennial age group showpiece will be announced closer to the championships. This is what all athletes strive for, to be selected to represent their country. And with that prospect inviting, we believe athletes we are naming today will jostle for a placing in the final team. We encourage all athletes, whether named in this squad or not to make all efforts to impress the ASA selectors, as there are no guarantees that those named today will be the ones going to Kenya, said Aleck Skhosana, the ASA president.SA preparation squad: Boys100m: Retshidisitswe Mlenga (AGN), Tshenolo Lemao (AGN) 200m: Mlenga, Lemao 400m: Sokwakhana Zazini (AGN) 800m: Ndimande Nthuthuko (CGA) 1 500m: Siyabonga Ndlovu (AGN), Ronen Oosthuizen (ANWN) 2 000m steeplechase: Robert de Villiers (ACNW), Olebogeng Moremi (ANWN) 110m hurdles: Julian Bogner (AGN), Roelof van der Walt (CGA) 400m hurdles: Zazini High jump: Breyton Poole (WPA) Pole vault: Valco van Wyk (BOL) Long jump: Bogner Shot put: Jonathan de Lacey Lacey (CGA) Discus throw: Morne Brandon (CGA), De Lacey Lacey Javelin throw: Joshua Maas (AMPU), Johannes Schlebusch (AFS) Girls100m: Rose Xeyi (AGN), Joviale Mbisa (AFS) 200m: Angel Kivido (AFS) 400m: Zeney van der Walt (AGN) 1 500m: Nicole Louw (AFS), Lyndi Roelofse (CGA) 3 000m: Diphua Mashishi (CGA) 2 000m steeplechase: Shanley Koekemoer (AGN), Cara du Preez (AGN) 400m hurdles: Gontse Morake (AGN), Z van der Walt Shot put: Meike Strydom (ASWD) Discus throw: Tharina van der Walt (AFS) Hammer throw: T van der Walt Javelin throw: Jana van Schalkwyk (BOL)African News Agency

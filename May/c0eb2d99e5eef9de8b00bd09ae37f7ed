THE HAGUE - An American hedge fund manager launched legal action against AkzoNobel on Tuesday to try and oust its head after the world's top paintmaker repeatedly rejected a takeover bid by US rival PPG.Amsterdam-based AkzoNobel, whose best-known brands include Dulux and Trimetal, on Monday snubbed the third offer from PPG, saying it "undervalues" the company.READ: Dutch cycle makers gear up in giant merger talksBut according to shareholder Elliott Advisors, rejecting the offer -- which would have valued the company at some 24.6 billion euros (R364.29-billion) -- was "a flagrant breach" of AkzoNobel's duties and "an arrogant dismissal of recognised principles of proper corporate governance."In a statement, the New York-headquartered fund manager, which holds a stake of just over 3.0 percent in AkzoNobel, said it had filed a petition with the Dutch Enterprise Chamber, asking for an extraordinary meeting to be held where shareholders could vote on whether to dismiss board chairman, Antony Burgmans.It accused AkzoNobel's boards of pursuing "their own, self-entrenching interests and (acting) against the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders."For its part, AkzoNobel, formed in 1994 from the merger of the Dutch and Swedish firms Akzo and Nobel, believes there is "significant integration risk" to the tie-up with PPG.It complains that PPG has given no indication as to how it plans to get the merger past the anti-trust authorities.Neither has it made any job guarantees for AkzoNobel's 46,000-strong workforce.AkzoNobel, which booked a stronger-than-expected first quarter, is planning to spin off its specialist chemicals division to placate shareholders.After falling more than 3.0 percent on Monday, its shares were higher on the Amsterdam AEX on Tuesday, gaining some 1.55 percent to 78.02 euros by midday.Last month, some shareholders had already pushed to oust Burgmans, but the company refused, saying his dismissal "would be irresponsible, disproportionate (and) damaging".AFP

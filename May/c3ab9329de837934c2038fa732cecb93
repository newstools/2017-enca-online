Reason being with the evidence that we've gathered since Friday there's a clear indication that the charge should be incitement instead of conspiracy. Because where in you say a person has conspired to commit a crime obviously there should be a person or persons that conspired with him or her to commit the crime," Louw added. NPA spokesperson: at this point we have no information to say this was a coup plot. #ElvisRamosebudi eNCA

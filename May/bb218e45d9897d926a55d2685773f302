We need to go beyond the stereotype of what African music is, locked in the tourist curio realm of drums, he said.Soprano Osorio, who is also co-executive director of Africa Arts, said she was thrilled about the response to the organisation s collaboration with the office of the premier of the Western Cape Government and Iziko Museums.She said: Africa Arts was very honoured that we could enable two African premieres and commission two world premieres with talented African classical music composers, and that the audience gave such a favourable reception. She said the event showed that there was a hunger in Africa for classical music experiences that showcased the talent on the continent and celebrated inclusivity in the arts scene.Ndodana-Breen added: Africa has ancient traditions, as we saw in Tunde Jegede playing the Kora but also it has a modern artistic expression just like Europe or Asia. Yesterday s concert could have been a concert of new music in London or New York. It had a modern cosmopolitan but African feel to it. African News Agency

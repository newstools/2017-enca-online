DURBAN - Youth in sub-Saharan Africa were simply not interested in agriculture as a career, with the average age of Africa s small-scale farmers over 60 years.This emerged during a session at the World Economic Forum on Africa taking place in Durban this week. The average age of our small-scale farmers is 60 to 65 years. That s retirement age for most people in this room, said Birjup Patel from the Export Trading Group company during the session titled Africa s Food Paradox .LIVE COVERAGE: WEF Africa - 'Inclusive Growth'Patel said that there was a stigma attached to farming as it was often viewed as a chore. The solution is to make them into entrepreneurs, said Patel.That would involve giving young people access to finance, risk management tools, insurance and technology.The session heard that Africa spent $35-billion a year importing food, not counting fish, and that by 2025 this figure was expected to reach $110-billion as the population was expected to continue increasing.African News Agency

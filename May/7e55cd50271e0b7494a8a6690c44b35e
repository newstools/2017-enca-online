CAPE TOWN - Lodged in between two big towns on the Garden Route, Sedgefield is often just a bridge to greener pastures.The town is home to just 15,000 people and has scarce employment options.Fatigued from working in the town s shops, Michelle Lencoe turned to tourism."Guys who come from Cape Town or Joburg, they often drive past Sedgefield. They don't get to stop and experience what we offer," she saysLencoe takes people on guided forest walks of three to nine kilometres, or on township tours showcasing small entrepreneurs."If you say township tour most of the people say, 'It's one and the same, we've been on a township tour in Joburg, Durban, Cape Town.' With my township tour it's not only to show you guys how we are battling in the township, the poverty. It's about what people are doing for themselves, to upgrade themselves." She works in collaboration with the local tourism office, which helps market and refer clients, a scarcity in off-peak times."Our tourists months starts from September to April, it's sort of a six-month period where you get to survive. We try to cover up for the other six months that we don't get a lot of tourists coming in." Tourism and investment promoter Wesgro is invested in assisting these small players.Says Yaw Perrah, Wesgro chief business officer: "The regional offices help the smaller businesses and we help the regional offices There are some really cool and funky little areas and events that happen in these smaller regions, which we try and focus on and help them in whatever way we can."Growth in the multimillion-rand sector, would also address unemployment."We are blessed with tourism and, for me, it's a relatively easy way for us to create jobs in our country. So we have to find a way to nurture this and create a platform so that we can actually help the smaller companies and also the big ones." eNCA

DAR ES SALAAM Tanzanian President John Magufuli fired his mining minister and the chief of the state-run mineral audit agency on Wednesday after an investigation into possible undeclared exports by mining companies to evade tax.Magufuli's decision, announced in a televised speech, signals an escalation of tensions between the government and the mining industry, which has denied engaging in tax evasion.Mining accounts for about 4 percent of Tanzania's gross domestic product.Magufuli said the investigation findings revealed that Acacia Mining declared the presence of gold, copper and silver in its mineral sand exports but did not declare other precious metals in the consignments, including titanium and iridium.READ: Tanzania's president pushes for listing of mining companiesThe company denied any wrongdoing and said it had not yet seen the report."Acacia reiterates that it fully declares everything of commercial value that we produce and pays all appropriate royalties and taxes on all of the payable minerals," it said in a statementMagufuli also said that the Minister of Mines and Minerals, Sospeter Muhongo, and the state-run Tanzania Minerals Audit Agency (TMAA) were guilty of failings in the monitoring of gold and copper concentrate exports."I like Professor Muhongo very much ... he is my friend, but I would like him to assess himself on this issue and vacate his position without delay," Magufuli said after receiving the report on examinations of 200 shipping containers of gold and copper concentrates.Magufulu also sacked the agency's chief executive, Dominic Rwekaza, and disbanded the board of the mineral audit agency, saying they failed to supervise exports properly.Muhongo was not immediately available for comment, neither was anyone from the TMAA.Reuters

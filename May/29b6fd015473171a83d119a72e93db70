DURBAN Lamontville Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen says Sunday s Nedbank Cup semifinal at home to Orlando Pirates is a massive game for his side as they seek a first-ever appearance in the final of South Africa s most prestigious knockout competition.Pirates greater experience and excellent recent record against Golden Arrows makes them perhaps favourites, but Larsen feels his side can go all the way. Sunday is a huge game for our club, a number of the kids on this team have never reached a semifinal, yet alone a final, so hopefully they will get a taste of a cup final, he says. It will take a huge effort on Sunday against an ever-improving Pirates team. We will give our all and hope we can get the result. Larsen says Golden Arrows victory in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge last season has given the younger members of his squad a taste of winning a trophy, and that in turn has bred confidence. What I have realised with our young players is that they rise to the occasion on the big games. They thrive on those occasions and I think they are a confident young group. Being champions in the MDC last season did give them a little bit of confidence at this level and a little bit of arrogance too, but in a good way, and that holds them in good stead. I don t think they will crumble under the pressure, I think they will thrive. Golden Arrows only previous major trophy came in 2009 when they blitzed Ajax Cape Town 6-0 in the final of the Top Eight.African News Agency

Thabo Dloti was honoured by ABSIP and awarded the CEO of the decade back in 2013, in him we see an astute professional that can take the reins at any financial entity we should be asking ourselves some questions, said the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals' President Sibongiseni Mbatha.Liberty s financial performance under Dloti was impacted by challenging macroeconomic conditions across the territories in which it operates.READ: Liberty pays out R17m a day in claimsMajor shareholder Standard Bank s Corporate and Investment Banking CEO David Munro will take over from Dloti.ABSIP believes the outgoing CEO had a long-term strategy, while the board was chasing short-term gains. I think the board may have wanted to implement some quick wins and they thought that David was the right person to take Liberty forward, but we are (aggrieved) that there was no ready black professional at Liberty, now it begs the question is there a succession plan at Liberty! said MbathaDloti is the second black CEO to leave a financial institution in the past two weeks.About 20 black professionals staged a walkout at Absa Capital when Phakamani Hadebe was passed over for the position of head of corporate and investment banking.READ: Sudden staff departure at Absa opens window on discontentThe Black Management Forum met with the bank to question the move.ABSIP says it will meet with Liberty and Standard Bank to question its transformation succession plan. eNCA

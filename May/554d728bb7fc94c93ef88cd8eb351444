I felt slow and sluggish in the first set due to the difficult nature of Kawano s game, but then I began getting used to it and my groove back despite the heat and extreme humidity in the second and third set to win the match, said Sithole.Sithole s coach, Holger Losch said: It took some time for Lucas to get used to the extremely effective and low bouncing slice balls from Kawano.

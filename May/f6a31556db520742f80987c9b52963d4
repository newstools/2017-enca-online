ABUJA - Another schoolgirl from the 'Chibok girls' has escaped from Boko Haram a presidential spokesman said on Wednesday.Approximately 270 girls have been kidnapped by the group in April 2014 from the northeastern town of Chibok.Earlier this month, the militants swapped 82 of the girls in exchange for prisoners.READ: Boko Haram kills six farmers in NE NigeriaVice President Yemi Osinbajo at a cabinet meeting in the capital Abuja on Wednesday "announced that another Chibok schoolgirl had been found after she escaped from her captors," said the spokesman."I learnt she is already being brought to Abuja," he said, giving no further details.Of the 270 girls originally kidnapped, around 60 have escaped and more than 100 have been released. About 100 more are still believed to be in captivity.Boko Haram's insurgency has killed more than 20,000 people and displaced more than two million since 2009 in an attempt to create an Islamic caliphate in northeastern Nigeria.Three years ago, the abduction of the girls from their secondary school by Boko Haram sparked global outrage and a celebrity-backed campaign #bringbackourgirls.READ: Purported Boko Haram fighter says group plans to bomb Nigerian capitalFor more than two years there was no sign of the girls.But the discovery of one of them with a baby last May raised hopes for their safety, with a further two girls found in later months and a group of 21 released by the Islamist militants in October.Although the Chibok girls are the most high-profile case, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of adults and children, many of whose cases are neglected, say aid organisations.The group often uses those captives, especially young girls and women, as suicide bombers.

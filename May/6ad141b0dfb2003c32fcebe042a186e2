He was issued with a temporary residence [permit] not a visa. As per the regulations, a Nigerian national must be in possession of a visa, so there is a contravention of the Act here. He was not allowed to enter South Africa without a visa, he was issued a single entry only and came into South Africa without a relevant visa, said Klaasen, adding that he had no idea how this could happen at various ports of entry.Read: 'I am having suicidal thoughts': Nigerian pastorKlaasen told the court that government printers indicated that the pastor s temporary residence permit was dispatched in Port Elizabeth.On 20 May 2000, a request for eight permits, including a temporary residence permit, was made all of which were issued the same day, he said.A permit issued by a former home affairs official in Port Elizabeth was fraudulent, making the televangelist eligible for deportation.

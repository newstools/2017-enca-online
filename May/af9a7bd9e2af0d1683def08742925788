PRETORIA - All Blacks centre Malakai Fekitoa scored a brilliant solo try to give Otago Highlanders of New Zealand a 17-10 win over Northern Bulls of South Africa in cold, wet Pretoria on Saturday.A cut-up pitch after heavy pre-match rain meant there was little running rugby and the round 12 match developed into a titanic struggle between two mud-covered packs.Smarting from a record 38-point home loss in Super Rugby last weekend to another New Zealand outfit, leaders Canterbury Crusaders, Bulls had chances to win this time.

"It was tough trying to play footie out there."Handling was difficult as the ball was like a bar of soap, but we believe in each other and that is what keeps the victories coming."Liebenberg, deputising as captain for injured hooker Adriaan Strauss, said the red-carding of Snyman cost his team a chance of winning."That was the turning point of the match, but our performance offered hope for the future."After trailing to an early Bulls penalty, Highlanders led 10-3 at half-time only for the hosts to level on 48 minutes through a converted try.Victory kept Highlanders in line for a quarter-finals place, five points ahead of challengers Auckland Blues of New Zealand.Bulls are 11 points adrift of Africa 1 leaders and fellow South African side Western Stormers with five rounds remaining.Full-back Matt Faddes and Fekitoa scored tries for Highlanders which temporary replacement Fletcher Smith and Banks converted, Smith also slotted a penalty.Full-back Warrick Gelant was Bulls' try scorer and fly-half Tian Schoeman kicked the conversion and a penalty.AFP

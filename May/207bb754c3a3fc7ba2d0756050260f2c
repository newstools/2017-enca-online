JOHANNESBURG The Democratic Alliance has been reliably informed that a number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Gauteng have not received their monthly grant funding for the 2017/18 financial year, the DA said on Sunday. Late payments severely impact the services that need to be rendered by NGOs in the province. Finances are key to ensuring better care and upliftment for Gauteng s most vulnerable, young and old, DA MPL and spokeswoman Refiloe Nt sekhe said.This was not the first time that the department had forgotten its mandate , and now NGOs were unable to afford food, keep the lights on, and provide comfort to the province s most vulnerable people.Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza had a responsibility to ensure that internal financial controls were strengthened to ensure timeous payments to NGOs in the province, Nt sekhe said.#LifeEsidimeni: Department to pay millions for psychiatric patients The DA will not stand back and allow another Esidimeni. NGOs play a vital role in our society and need to be treated as such. A solid partnership between the department and NGOs is necessary to ensure that no child, woman, mentally ill, elderly, or disabled person is left behind. The DA will write to MEC Mayathula-Khoza to urge her to investigate non-payments to NGOs and to fast-track payments in areas identified by the department, Nt sekhe said.African News Agency

Next stop: Moses Mabhida Stadium, 24 June 2017 #OnceAlways #NedbankCup pic.twitter.com/Krleyshxlg With the near-capacity crowd enjoying the sun at the picturesque venue in KwaMashu, Kjell Jonevret s side once more put in a convincing display in the Cup, looking cohesive and confident throughout the 90 minutes. Arrows had their moments and made a good game of it, especially in the second half, but Abbubaker Mobara s goal 10 minutes before half-time proved to be enough for the visitors to run out winners.Bucs started the stronger team, looking purposeful on the ball and chances were created as Mpho Makola fired wide of the near post after a scintillating 11th minute counter attack before Thabo Rakhale shot over the bar and then Marc van Heerden hit a free kick straight at Arrows keeper Nkosingiphile Gumede.Abafana bes Thende managed to open up the Pirates defence with a penetrating move in the 26th minute, but instead of shooting, Nduduzo Sibaya elected to pass to Knox Mutizwa and the opportunity went to waste.Just when it looked like the home side were finding their way back into the game, Pirates struck in clinical style when Mobara applied a deft header at the near post to guide home Makola s well-placed in-swinging free kick. FULL TIME: Golden Arrows 0-1 Orlando Pirates. The Bucs are through to the #NedbankCup Final pic.twitter.com/lFZoDqc2XQ Firing on all cylinders, the Buccaneers went looking for more goals and when Makola picked out Thabo Matlaba who squared the ball for Thamsanqa Gabuza five minutes later, it looked set to be 2-0, only for home defender Limbikani Mzava to make a brilliant last-gasp clearance.The action continued thick and fast after the restart as Bucs keeper Jackson Mabokgwane saved comfortably from Sibaya, while at the other end of the field Gumede kept out two free kicks from van Heerden and also denied Rakhale from a tight angle.With the tension mounting chances grew less frequent, while play was halted for a few moments after the two coaches Jonevret and Clinton Larsen, exchanged some choice words on the sidelines. @Orlando_Pirates fan doing the victory dance #NedbankCup pic.twitter.com/EioIrlprei Arrows increased the pressure in the dying moments of the match, and there were chances as Sibusiso Sibeko had a couple of shots blocked before Lerato Lamola s header was well-saved by Mabokgwane.Sibiya was desperately unlucky to see his added time free kick thumping the woodwork before a header from the resultant corner went straight at Mabokgwane, as the Sea Robbers held on rather desperately for the win which gives them the chance to salvage something from what has been an underwhelming overall season.African News Agency

CAPE TOWN - Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has urged South Africans to accept the R6-billion she says is needed to make sure Sassa takes full control of the grants payment system.Speaking before Parliament on Wednesday, she told MPs it s going to take five years to set up a one-stop payment shop.It s the first time Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza and Dlamini have been seen side by side in Parliament, amid reports they have a frosty relationship following the Sassa grants debacle that played out earlier this year.The Constitutional Court has given Sassa another 10 months to use the company Cash Paymaster Systems to deliver social grants, as Sassa was created primarily to pay out grants and so should not be paying an external company to do its job.But the Minister says it is going to take another five years before Sassa can do it alone. We have agreed that it s not going to take 12 months to bring the whole programme to its totality," she said.READ: It will take five years to take over grant payments - Dlamini"Yes, the company paying has to go, we agree, but this is going to be a five-year process and the estimation we have is plus minus R6-billion."But South Africans must look at the whole process as an investment because once we start paying, you won t have to pay this amount of money, said Dlamini.The Minister also justified her controversial workstream system which she introduced in parallel to Sassa s normal functions.Dlamini told MPs that Sassa does not have the necessary staff to fulfil its work, and so she may go to court to force Treasury to approve the costs. We have been explaining on a daily basis why we have workstreams. But in one Scopa meeting a Treasury official said we can have them and then these are the issues we are dealing with. eNCA

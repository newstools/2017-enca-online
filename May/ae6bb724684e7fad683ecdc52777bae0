LOS ANGELES Kevin Durant scored 38 points and the Golden State Warriors withstood a determined Utah effort to down the Jazz 102-91 on Saturday to take a commanding 3-0 lead in their NBA playoff series.The Warriors will try to close out the best-of-seven Western Conference second-round series in game four on Monday in Salt Lake City.The Jazz had hoped a return to their home floor on Saturday would spark a resurgence, and it briefly looked as if it had.

Gobert, however, missed both free throws.Gobert finished the night with 21 points and 15 rebounds for the Jazz, who were led by Gordon Hayward's 29 points but still find themselves one defeat away from elimination.AFP

CAPE TOWN - SABC CEO James Aguma's suggestion that the broadcasting act should be amended, got social media abuzz.Aguma told Parliament s portfolio committee meeting on Wednesday that South Africans should pay for a TV licence when they buy a mobile phone, computer or tablet.Aguma wants to change the definition of what a receiving device is, because SABC content can be viewed on a variety of devices and some South Africans did not take kindly to the idea.Some blamed former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng for the national broadcaster being short of money and requiring a bail-out. Some people took to Twitter to express their views of the idea.#SABC me: mom SABC wants its licence payed ...Mom: let then come take SABC off my TV, i will youtube Generations with yo phone.#SABC I will pay the Tv license the day hell freezes over! pic.twitter.com/3q6E76O1KLThe way bayfuna ngakhona lemali yerr TV License for my phone --#SABC pic.twitter.com/aydCGZZbN7 #SABC #IWillPaySABCDeviceLicenceWhen They stop showing this every five minutes pic.twitter.com/sYwRCJgs9BIf we pay for the computer, cell phone and table licence #SABC is going to give us free Internet? pic.twitter.com/zHxVuiJy6m#SABC don't have that financial thing pic.twitter.com/Micrwu43UHeNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Minister of Women in the Presidency Susan Shabangu explained on Wednesday why she had described Karabo Mokoena as weak, in an interview with eNCA s Checkpoint programme.Shabangu said she had meant Mokoena was vulnerable. To eNCA, which says I say Karabo was weak, I just wish to say Karabo was vulnerable. Karabo was in a relationship where she thought it would work for her but it led to the unfortunate death of her," Shabangu told a press briefing ahead of her budget vote.She had been roundly criticised on social media after commenting after Mokoena's funeral that the young woman had been weak.@Checkpoint_eNCA #KaraboMokoena was not weak! She was a victim of abuse. Uncalled for and disrespectful words by #SusanShabangu.I am so disgusted by Susan Shabangu and her stupid comments, how dare she speak so carelessly.This is why women in SA are in danger,because patriachy matrons like Susan Shabangu are in charge.Disgrace of a woman #checkpointShabangu said on Wednesday that the murder raised the issue of how men behaved towards women and believed they had the right to assault women."That s what we also have to look at. One of the responsibilities of the government and society as a whole is to make sure there s a change of attitudes. Hence you can t mobilise one sector of the community, which is women; you also have to change [men's] attitudes to accept that women are not punching bags or objects they can do anything with," Shabangu said.And women needed to be economically empowered so they were not financially dependent on men, she said.WATCH: Checkpoint PART1 - Karabo's Secret Hell eNCA

JOHANNESBURG Garreth Soldierboy McLellan has confirmed to eNCA that reports of his departure from the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, the UFC are true.The formerly dominant middleweight champion of EFC Worldwide - who claimed the scalps of African standouts such as Dricus du Plessis, Jeremy Smith, JP Kruger, Tumelo Maphutha and Danie can Heerden - struggled to continue his form with the Las Vegas based global leader. Former @EFCworldwide Champion Garreth 'Soldierboy' McLellan removed from @UFC Fighter roster according to @UFCFIGHTERSiNFOWinning just once in five fights, McLellan fought in Poland, Ireland, Holland, Canada and Brazil during his tenure. His management company released this press statement last night: I can confirm that I have parted ways with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) after being with them for the past 3 years, said McLellan. After signing with the group in 2014, I spent a lot of time away from my family traveling and competing overseas, and would now like to shift my focus on being a husband and father. On the business front, I will now be concentrating on various projects for both my personal brand and Soldierboy Management brand (SBM). Being a pioneer and a leader of MMA in the country and abroad for over 10 years, I look forward to taking a well-deserved break and will consider my options of returning. READ: The Clinch TV - Pride of the LionWithin hours of The Clinch announcing his departure from the UFC, several EFC athletes were already putting themselves in the Hexagon to face McLellan, most notably the current BAMMA and EFC middleweight champion, Yannick Bahati. Greatest EFC star, If he needs a fight I'll take that @EFCworldwide https://t.co/EgEJANvXTNIt is evident that such a stalwart of MMA on these shores who has fought for the biggest combat brand in the world is immediately relevant within the middleweight division, particularly considering that current welterweight champion Dricus du Plessis is moving up to middleweight to face Bahati for the title in Johannesburg on August 19 in what will be one of the biggest fights in EFC s history.Putting McLellan in this mix is a delicious conundrum for EFC matchmaker Graeme Cartmell, should the Durban legend decide to strap up once more and reclaim African gold.McLellan is a confirmed guest on next week s episode of The Clinch where we hope to be able to find out more of Soldierboy s real fighting intentions. eNCA

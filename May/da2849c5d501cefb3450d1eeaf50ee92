CAPE TOWN The Minister of Higher Education and Training, Minister Blade Nzimande on Tuesday, said that investment in infrastructure is critical to ensuring quality teaching.Tabling his department s budget vote in parliament on Tuesday, Nzimande put emphasis on the need for infrastructure and investments in South Africa as a means to add to the success and quality of higher education and training.He said that the boost in infrastructure investments will ensure the quality of teaching, learning, and researching spaces, equipment and teaching resources, and conducive student living and learning environments.Over the given period in his speech which is 2016/17 and 2017/18, his department would have injected new investments of R6.964 billion for the development of infrastructure at universities. R2.1 billion will be for student housing development, R1.475 billion will go to universities to refurbish and update current infrastructure and to deal with backlog maintenance, R2 billion is for building Sol Plaatje University and the University of Mpumalanga, R600 million is earmarked for Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University to enable its development as a new university, he said. R248.9 million is for infrastructure projects at Historically Disadvantaged Institutions linked to their individual development plans, and R300 million is for priority projects to be identified by universities, and which may include improving disability access, well-founded laboratories, security upgrades or infrastructure and communication technology developments. The infrastructure investments ties into the housing needed to accommodate students, therefore the department s student housing infrastructure programme (SHIP) one of the biggest priorities.Approximately 200,000 beds are needed for universities alone as well as accommodation for TVET colleges. According to the Minister steady progress is being made in their joint work with the Department of Public Works in search for government buildings that are not currently being used to be converted into student accommodation. Given the large shortages in this area, our universities and colleges will still have to rely on privately owned student accommodation facilities. I, however, intend undertaking research to establish ownership patterns in this sector in order to ensure that there is meaningful participation by all South Africans, especially black African owners and participation of youth and women, including co-operatives, Nzimande said.Despite these shortages, the government is continuing to fund the publicly owned student housing. At the new Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in GaRankuwa, we have for instance allocated R1.2 billion over the next four years for infrastructure development. Part of this funding will provide decent housing for the students, he addedHis department, however, has already started with providing their first 2,000 beds and from next year students that are travelling 50 kilometres to accommodation in the Pretoria CBD, will be housed on campus.African News Agency

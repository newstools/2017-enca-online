JOHANNESBURG Quinton de Kock matched the previous performances of superstars Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers when he was named South African Cricketer of the Year and received a total of five awards at a glittering Cricket South Africa (CSA) awards function in Kyalami, northern Johannesburg, on Saturday evening.Only Kagiso Rababa has done better with his six CSA awards last year.The other nine players to have received CSA s most prestigious award are Jacques Kallis (2004 and 2011), Makhaya Ntini (2005 and 2006), Amla (2010 and 2013) and De Villiers (2014 and 2015), who have all won the award twice with the other previous winners being Shaun Pollock (2007), Dale Steyn (2008), Graeme Smith (2009), Vernon Philander (2012) and Rabada (2016).In addition to the main award, De Kock was named Standard Bank Test Cricketer of the Year and Standard Bank ODI Cricketer of the Year, was honoured by his peers by being named SA Players Player of the Year and by supporters as the SA Fans' Player of the Year. Simply outstanding! What a year Quinton has had, commented CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat. He has shown the maturity of a seasoned campaigner with performances that have really counted when needed most, often blowing away the opposition in the process. It is encouraging that for the second time in a row our premier award has gone to one of our young stars who is shining with distinction alongside our world-class senior players.De Kock received a sixth award as the ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year.His statistics for the year were remarkable, highlighted by his ODI innings of 178 against Australia in a series in which he scored 300 runs, at an average of exactly 60, and a strike rate in excess of 137.His Test match performances were notable for his ability to score big runs when needed and to take the game away from the opposition.In addition, the quality of his glove work was brilliant.READ: Proteas wrecking ball Rabada wants to stay the courseThe only awards De Kock did not win for which he was eligible were the Standard Bank T20 International Player of the Year award, which went to Imran Tahir for the second year in a row, and the KFC Award of Excellence, which was awarded to Temba Bavuma, again for the second successive year, for his brilliant run-out of David Warner.De Kock was not a contender for RAM Delivery of the Year and that again went to Rabada, for his delivery that bowled Usman Khawaja at Perth.Sune Luus was named SA Women s Cricketer of the Year, while Lizelle Lee was the SA Women Players' Player of the Year.The International Newcomer of the Year award went to Keshav Maharaj and Laura Wolvaardt.Lorgat said: The way the Proteas have come through to rise up the ICC rankings in meteoric fashion has been quite brilliant and we now have a real team in the true sense of the word.

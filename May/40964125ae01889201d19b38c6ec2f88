JOHANNESBURG - SA s contribution to global gold production will fall below 5% by 2020 BMI Research said in a report released on Tuesday morning.While global gold production rose 6.5% to about 109.6-million ounces in 2020 from 102.9-million ounces in 2017 SA s output would stagnate at about 5-million ounces the research firm within the Fitch group forecast.READ: GDP: Fall in mining production puts SA economy in slumpBMI forecasts SA s gold production to decline 1% to 4.85-million ounces in 2017 from 4.9-million in 2016 but recover to 5.01-million ounces in 2020. SA s gold production will pick up on the back of rising prices which will improve gold miner s margins. However growth will continue to be hampered by ongoing labour unrest and power shortages. Major miners in the country continue to scale back operations and look abroad to invest the report said. Notably in December 2016 SA-based Sibanye Gold announced plans to acquire US-based platinum group metals Stillwater Mining Company for $2.2bn. We forecast SA s gold output to account for approximately 4.6% of global gold production over this period compared to an average 5.6% over the previous five-year period. Australia s gold production is forecast to grow 9% to 12.45-million ounces in 2017 after achieving 8% growth to 11.43-million ounces 2016. A weaker Australian dollar compared to the US dollar will continue to boost the gold sector leading to mine expansions and increased exploration activities by the top miners. For example in February Resolute Mining received environmental approval to restart operations at the Sarsfield open pit. The firm s Ravenswood expansion project will extend local operations for an additional 13 years and increase average annual gold production by 120 000oz. In January senior miner Gold Fields received environmental approval for the estimated 270 00oz per annum Gruyere gold project which the firm is developing with partner Gold Road Resources BMI said.READ: Uranium mining in the Karoo - South Africa's new gold?The world s biggest gold producer China is forecast to grow 1.5% to 16.47-million ounces in 2017. Major Chinese firms will ramp up investment in foreign gold mines as the country s gold demand growth far outpaces that of production. Indeed in 2016 the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 44.7% of global gold mining merger and acquisition activity. In April Chinese firm Shandong Gold purchased a 50% stake in the Veladero mine in Argentina from Barrick Gold for $960m the report said. In 2015 China set up a new $16bn mining fund to develop gold mining projects along the planned Silk Road infrastructure route. We forecast China s gold mine production to stagnate over the coming years at around 16.5-million ounces. iNet Bridge

BLOEMFONTEIN - Cosatu decided to cancel all scheduled speeches at its main Workers' Day rally in Bloemfontein on Monday.The decision comes as President Jacob Zuma was heckled by some members during the gathering, singing that he should step down. They believed Zuma's address would be inconsistent with the trade union s call for him to step down.Sections of the crowd chant; 'We heard the good news that Zuma is going' & 'Zuma must go' #WorkersDay pic.twitter.com/nTBScCgF50READ: Zuma not welcome at May Day celebrations: unionsAs President Jacob Zuma arrives, chants against him are drowned out by chants of 'Zuma!

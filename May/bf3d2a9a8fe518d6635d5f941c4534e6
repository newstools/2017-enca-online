JOHANNESBURG - Net1 and its subsidiaries have been granted the right to continue deducting money from the bank account of social grant beneficiaries.The North Gauteng High Court made its ruling on Tuesday.The majority of social grants from the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) are paid via Net1's subsidiary, Cash Paymaster Services, into accounts that beneficiaries hold with Grindrod Bank.Fees for financial services rendered are withdrawn from these accounts each month. Sassa has previously instructed that this practice be halted, but their request was disregarded.The companies were then charged with criminal conduct for failing to implement Sassa's instructions.The court said on Tuesday that the regulations clearly stipulate that recipients must receive the full grant amount before deductions can be made.However, it also found that these regulations do not apply to debit orders lawfully deducted with the account holder s consent. eNCA

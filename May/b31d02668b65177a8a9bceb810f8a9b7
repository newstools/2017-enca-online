The dogs and their handlers volunteer their services to the foundation.The smallest dog used is a spaniel and the biggest is an Irish wolfhound, which stands a metre tall.The therapy time is dependent on each case.Omar explains: It's a ground-breaking, unique programme, the first of its kind in the country, in Canada and Australia they ve made some strides, but using dogs clothed as court personnel is a first of its kind internationally. Omar says therapy not only helps children be credible witnesses but rebuilds their trust in people as they see that not all dogs bite and not all people hurt children. The foundation assists over 100 children a month through this sort of therapy -- free of charge.eNCA

This is largely attributed to the lower than expected economic growth environment that businesses faced in the first quarter of 2017. It suggested business were taking a conservative approach in their corporate strategies preferring to ensure solid balance sheets rather than embarking on new ventures that may impair their solvency .Experian said the fallout of the Cabinet reshuffle was likely to be seen in most of the domestic economic indicators in the coming months including in the second-quarter business debt index.The debt index for both the agriculture and mining sectors turned positive in the first quarter.However for the retail sector it deteriorated markedly with consumer spending and local demand declining sharply.iNet Bridge

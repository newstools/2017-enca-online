 TEL AVIV - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, offered sympathetic words to visiting US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania on Monday, telling them that people still loved them despite negative media coverage.Standing on the red carpet and chatting minutes after Trump and the First Lady had arrived at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport in Air Force One, Sara Netanyahu was caught on camera exchanging a few private words with the visitors.Sara's red-carpet conversation soon began circulating on social media, along with another awkward arrival moment.As the Netanyahus strode along holding hands, as they often do, Trump, walking alongside them, reached out to grasp the First Lady's hand, but video circulated on Twitter appeared to show Melania Trump briefly flicking his hand away.Reuters

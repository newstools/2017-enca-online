PARLIAMENT - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba told Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Floyd Shivambu not to take "cheap shots" at his family and to rather tackle him, the politician. Gigaba was responding to questions in Parliament's Standing Committee on Finance on Tuesday morning. "I don't think we should take cheap shots at each other using our families. You must engage me as a politician. Don't bring my family and I will not bring yours too - I'm not that cheap."Referring to Ayanda-Allie Paine's interview with Gigaba's wife, Norma on eNCA at the weekend, Shivambu asked Gigaba to clarify what advice his wife gave him when he was the Minister of Home Affairs and whether or not she'd be advising him in his new role. WATCH: Mrs Gigabytes - I'm my own womanDuring the interview, Mrs Gigaba spoke about the announcement that her husband would be moved to the Finance Ministry."I was excited because I also felt like I was working at Home Affairs because every day I was doing people's passports and everything. Also, I love growth."Gigaba denied, however, that his wife had attended any of his official meetings. Addressing Shivambu, he said: "It s important to say that your statements are fundamentally untrue, that she made any reference to telling me what IT solutions [to use]. She works in the IT sector."* Watch the exchange in the gallery above.eNCA

BAKU, Azerbaijan - Turkey's Ramil Guliev reaffirmed his dominance of the men's sprint events at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Baku on Thursday as he charged to gold in the 200-metre final.Baku-born Guliev had already won 100-metre gold on Tuesday in a time of 10.06s and he sprinted away from the field in the 200 metres to clock 20.08 seconds.The 200-metre European Championship silver medallist was well ahead of Bahrain's Salem Eid Yaqoob, who surged past the 2013 silver medallist Winston George in the final few metres to take second place with 20.56s. Guyana's George was 0.06s further back. Guliev may have managed it, but the sprint double eluded Gina Bass as she was beaten to women's 200-metre gold by Bahrain's Edidiong Ofonime Odiong.Bass was favourite to add to her 100-metre crown, but she was well beaten by the powerful 20-year-old Odiong, who secured Bahrain's fifth athletics gold of the Games in 22.95s, while Bass came in at 23.15s to claim silver ahead of Uzbekistan's Nigina Sharipova.Long distance star Ruth Jebet had earlier sealed Bahrain's first gold of the day as she won the women's 5000-metre final.Jebet strolled to glory in the 3000-metre steeplechase on Wednesday, but she was pushed all the way by Yasemin Can on Thursday after a superb effort from her training partner.The Olympic steeplechase champion passed the Turkish athlete on the final straight to win in 14 minutes and 53.41 seconds.European 5000- and 10,000-metre champion Can finished just 0.09s adrift of Jebet, while Kyrgyzstan's Daria Maslova was awarded the bronze after a lengthy consultation following a photo finish with UAE's Alia Mohammed. Maslova's time was 15:00:42.Odile Ahouanwanou landed Benin's first-ever gold medal in an Islamic Solidarity Games with victory in the women's 100-metre hurdles final.The 26-year-old powered clear in the final 30 metres to record a personal best time of 13.55 seconds and secure Benin's second athletics medal after Noelie Yarigo's bronze in the women's 800 metres.Turkey's Nevin Yanit Baltaci (13.71s) took silver, 0.14s ahead of Malaysia's Raja Nursheena Azhar, who clinched bronze for the second successive Games. Mohamed Tindouft surged to an emphatic gold in the men's 3000-metre steeplechase as Morocco dominated the men's middle-distance finals.The 24-year-old obliterated his season's best time by nearly four seconds to record eight minutes 26.26 seconds. Mohamed Ismail of Djibouti was a surprise silver medallist - only his country's second medal of the Games - while Turkey's Aras Kaya snatched bronze. Twenty-year-old Mostafa Smaili produced more Moroccan magic as he cruised to gold in the men's 800 metres to win his maiden major title.Smaili's personal best time of 1 minute 45.78 seconds was too good for Tunisian silver medallist Riadah Chninni and Algeria's Mohamed El Amin Belferar who finished third.Aleksandr Svechnikov won gold for Uzbekistan as he threw a world record distance of 70 metres to win the men's javelin F13 disability final, while Iranian duo Sajad Nikparast (silver) and Seyed Er Hosseini Liravi (bronze) completed the podium.Nadiya Dusanova landed a second gold for the Uzbeks as she won the women's high jump title with a leap of 1.80 metres.Algeria's Yousra Arar was awarded silver on 1.77m, while Guyana's Natrena Hooper was handed bronze despite notching the same score as Arar.It was Turkish delight in the men's hammer throw final as Esref Apak clinched gold from compatriot Ozkan Baltaci with a huge throw of 74.32 metres, after he fouled on his first three attempts.Baltaci was an agonising 19 centimetres short as he took silver in a Turkish one-two, while Qatar's Ahmed Elseify was third.Turkey's Eda Tugsuz launched her way to gold with a monster first-round throw of 67.21 metres in the women's javelin final.Tugsuz bettered the Olympic-winning distance of 66.18 metres set by Sara Kolak in Rio last year, while Iran's Sahar Ziaeisisakht (silver) and Turkey's Berivan Sakir (bronze) were a long way back. The Turks now have five athletics golds after they won three on Thursday.Algeria won their first athletics gold as Tahani Roumaiss Belabiod secured the women's long jump title with her first effort.6.33 metres was enough for gold with Maria Londa of Indonesia falling agonisingly short on 6.30m, while Cameroon's Marlyne Sarah Ngo Ngoa clinched bronze.Azerbaijan recorded their eighth athletics gold medal with a one-two finish in the men's 100-metre T11 disability final, which was won by Nurlan Ibrahimov.The Azeri clocked 11.60s to beat compatriot Elchin Muradov.

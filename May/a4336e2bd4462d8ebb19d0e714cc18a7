The player accepted a one-week sanction.Sekekete, a loose forward for the Golden Lions XV, was red carded in the 76th minute of their match against the Hino Valke on 14 May. The referee s report noted that the player had contravened Law 10.4 (e) by tackling an opponent around the neck, with force and following through .The contravention of Law 10.4 (e) was confirmed by Jacobs and it was noted that at the time of the contact between the player and the opposing player of the Hino Valke, Sekekete made contact with the neck and head of the opposing player.It was also apparent from the video footage that Sekekete s right arm, at the time the contact was made with the opponent, could be described as stiff arm contact. It was held that the player s conduct fell within the ambit of Law 10.4 (e) and that the red card should be confirmed.Sekekete s legal representative submitted that the contravention fell within the mid-range in terms of the sanctioning in World Rugby Regulation 17, of which the starting point for consideration, therefore, was a period of six weeks suspension.After taking into account mitigating factors, Jacobs reduced the sanction to five weeks and declared that the player was not eligible to play in the match on Saturday and four subsequent matches to be played thereafter.African News Agency

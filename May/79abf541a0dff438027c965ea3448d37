JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's bulk export volumes plunged by 27.4 percent year on year in April to 12.3 million tons after soaring 27.4 percent in March.The Transnet National Ports Authority said on Friday that the massive swings were, in part due to an enhanced Easter effect as the holidays fell in March in 2016 but in April this year. This boosted the year-on-year comparison for March and reduced it for April.In March bulk exports out of Saldanha mostly iron ore almost doubled (up 95.3 percent) to 5.8 million tons although this was followed by a 34.75 percent drop to 4.2 million tons in April.Bulk exports out of Richards Bay mostly coal rose only 1.1 percent year on year in March to 7.3 million tons but fell by 22.2 percent in April to 6.7 million tons.The exception to the April slump was bulk exports from other ports which ship agricultural goods such as grain and sugar. These rose 17.3 percent in April to 1.3 million tons.In the first quarter of 2017 bulk-export volumes grew 11.7 percent year on year but the plunge in April reduced the year-to-date increase to only 0.9% year on year. The record annual increase in this century was 9% set in 2010.iNet Bridge

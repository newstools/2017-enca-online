Very very excited to bring in my New Year in Johannesburg, headlining @afropunk pic.twitter.com/CDV7SvstEd The Afropunk mindset is less concerned with genres and pigeonholes, than the strength and unity of otherness. Modern South Africa is proof of the victory of otherness over historical precedent, and of the country s desire to mould a society based on virtues that are at the core of Afropunk, the statement added. We are excited about collaborating with South African artists, audiences and service providers in a similar way as we do in America and in Europe, as we establish Afropunk in Africa, said festival co-creator Matthew Morgan.He said music at the Afropunk Johannesburg celebration would be thoughtfully curated and include house, kwaito, punk, hip-hop, soul, reggae, roots, pop and other genres. The event culminates in an unforgettable New Year s Eve party in this awesome African city .Artists who have performed at past Afropunk festivals include Grace Jones, D Angelo, Mos Def, Lauryn Hill, Lenny Kravitz, Erykah Badu and Ice Cube.

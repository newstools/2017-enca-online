PARIS - WikiLeaks has been making headlines for more than a decade by releasing millions of classified documents, embarrassing governments worldwide while also raising fears that its activities may have put lives in danger.The controversy surrounding founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape accusations, has also polarised opinion on the group.FILE: Ecuador's Foreign Minister Guillaume Long addresses the media after Swedish prosecutors dropped an investigation of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday over a rape allegation, in Quito, Ecuador.

Again, the group denied the accusation.Arrest warrant The worst scandals to affect WikiLeaks have been those involving Assange.Hailed as a hero by supporters and reviled as a manipulator by critics, the white-haired Australian has been holed up in the Ecuadoran embassy in London since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation on May 19, 2017.British police, however, said they would still have to arrest Assange if he left the embassy, on the grounds that he had breached his bail.Snowden and ManningThe huge release of memos known as "cablegate", which embarrassed governments worldwide, would not have been possible had it not been for US soldier Chelsea Manning, who handed WikiLeaks 700,000 classified documents.FILE: Chelsea Manning, the transgender US Army soldier responsible for a massive leak of classified material, poses in a photo of herself for the first time since she was released from prison and post to social media on May 18, 2017.

Manning was freed on May 17, 2017.Former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden has also received WikiLeaks's backing, though he did not use the group's site to publish his leaks about the National Security Agency.Assange recommended he quickly flee to Moscow to evade prosecution in the US -- advice he heeded.In the movies Two major films have been made about WikiLeaks -- "The Fifth Estate" (2013) and "Risk", a documentary that was screened at the Cannes film festival last year.Assange meanwhile guest-starred as himself in an episode of "The Simpsons", recording his lines over the phone from the Ecuadoran embassy.

LONDON - As the ICC Champions Trophy in England and Wales draws near ahead of the first match on June 1, there are a number of matches across the three venues that stand out in the memories of cricket fans.Eight teams will compete for the title across three venues in England and Wales: the Kennington Oval in London, Edgbaston in Birmingham and Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. These three venues have hosted many matches, including ones played in ICC tournaments.READ: Ntini and Kallis SA s top individual performers in history of Champions TrophyThe most infamous and heart-breaking memory from a South African perspective was the World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston against Australia in 1999.Sometimes, a match is won by the smallest of margins and the 1999 World Cup semi-final, one of the greatest World Cup matches ever, was won by the smallest of them all: net run-rate. It didn t have to come down to that for either team if Allan Donald had not dropped his bat while trying to complete the winning run or if Shane Warne hadn t found his rhythm and taken 4/29.But despite a brilliant half-century from Jacques Kallis and some solid hitting from Lance Klusener, Donald s bat drop while the scores were tied still haunts Edgbaston if not the South Africans, who are yet to reach an ICC World Cup final.At the Kennington Oval, London, it was the Browne and Bradshaw show in the ICC Champions Trophy 2004 final between England and the West Indies.READ: Donald joins Sri Lanka as bowling consultant for Champions TrophyEngland was hosting the Champions Trophy after a long home season. It had reached the finals of a tournament that had seen its fair share of rain. But the venue wasn t the only thing under a cloud of gloom.The West Indies, under Brian Lara s captaincy, was trying to regain some of its former glory and beating the home side seemed like the perfect cure. The Caribbean islands had been hit by hurricanes earlier, and Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw were men on a mission, determined to give their people something to be happy about.With 71 runs and a title win that was dedicated to the victims of the hurricanes back home, Browne and Bradshaw will have fond memories of The Oval.At Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, another fine spectacle was witnessed in the inaugural match ICC World Cup 1999, between Australia and New Zealand.Hosting a One-Day International for the first time, Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, was treated to a spectacle in a fierce rivalry between the trans-Tasman neighbours. Darren Lehmann s half-century and Geoff Allott s 4/37 studded the first innings, setting New Zealand a chase of 214.Enter Roger Twose, who made his highest score of the tournament, an unbeaten 80, in a spectacular partnership of 148 with Chris Cairns (60) to chase down the target with 28 balls and five wickets to spare, giving Cardiff a brilliant start to hosting ODIs.

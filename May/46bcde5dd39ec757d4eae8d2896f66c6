Along with Burberry, he has been a vocal champion of expanding the traditional system, and timeline, of ordering designs strictly as they appear on the runway months in advance.True to his aesthetic, his Dubai show was conceptually complex but structurally clean: square necklines, skirts layered over pants and matte black shades in sharp contrast against uncoiffed hair and a soundtrack featuring the iconic songs of Lebanese diva Fairuz."I don't aim to make men feminine, or women masculine," Hourani told AFP after his show."It's to infuse the two anatomies and create one pure unisex neutral pattern. I think it's important to understand what neutrality is, what unisex is about."'Bold and unapologetic'On the other end of the spectrum is Marchesa.The brand's trademark fairytale pre-fall collection was an instant hit with the Arab Fashion Week crowd, some of whom put on their Marchesa best for the occasion. Many were still snapping selfies on the catwalk moments after the lights dimmed and music started.With three-dimensional floral appliques, layers of tulle, long beaded fringe and intricate embroidery in blush, blue and metallics, Marchesa's collection of gowns was met with nods and excited whispers.

She's bold, and she's glamorous, and she's feminine, and she's unapologetic about that."And it's not just the women who are bold in their sartorial choices. We are in love with @rafeeaalhajsi look for #ArabFashionWeek #teutamatoshiduriqiA post shared by Teuta Matoshi Duriqi (@teutamatoshiduriqi) on Barakat Bespoke, a family business out of Little Rock, Arkansas, showcased a selection of suits, cuffed pants and cotton tees on a group of male models from around the world, and of different ages."This is the first time we've done anything international," said designer Filat, as her gold-lipped, braided-haired models stopped to hug her backstage."We have to design things a little differently for the Middle East, but it's a little more fun," she said."We can do things a bit more outside the box than what we do traditionally, since ... we design for the (US) south, generally, which is very conservative."And with the Muslim fashion industry booming, spending on modest wear -- which includes both traditionally feminine and gender-shunning designs -- is expected to top $480 billion annually by 2019."There's more strictness in the Middle East, but I also see here so many women who are free, who are evolving," said Hourani."People understand my clothes -- women and men. It doesn't feel at all that I'm in the wrong place."AFP

Mbambo said two men had forced her and her eight-year-old son out of her vehicle and sped off with the child.Hundreds of police, emergency services and volunteers joined the search, which made national and international headlines.The driver's vehicle was found abandoned in Montclair, but the baby seat and baby apparel had been taken.

It was not immediately clear if the third suspect would be charged.Police said they would file a civil suit against the suspects for costs incurred through time and resources.African News Agency

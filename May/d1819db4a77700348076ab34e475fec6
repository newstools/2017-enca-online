AUCKLAND - The Blues ran the Cheetahs ragged and scored eight tries to thump the South Africans 50-32 in a Super Rugby clash at Eden Park on Friday.The Cheetahs had managed to claw their way back into the match after an initial four-try blitz in the first half by the Blues, with flyhalf Fred Zeilinga slotting two penalties just before half-time to take the score to 24-18 to the home team.But three more Blues touchdowns within six minutes after the break was enough to kill off the game as a contest.READ: Highlanders snatch late win against CheetahsWhile Cheetahs fans would ve been expecting the worst in New Zealand due to their team s poor record overseas, the Bloemfontein outfit actually rocked the Blues by getting onto the scoreboard first, with captain Francois Venter creating a dummy and eventually getting the ball down in the eighth minute.But it didn t take long for Tana Umaga s free-flowing side from breaching the flimsy Cheetahs defence, with a simple backline move ending in fullback Melani Nanai offloading in the tackle for wing Rieko Ioane to score.The see-sawing nature of the first half continued, as first the Cheetahs responded with a Torsten van Jaarsveld rumbling over from a maul off a five-metre lineout to put the visitors 12-7 ahead after 14 minutes.But the Cheetahs lacked an appetite for defence on the night, with wing Raymond Rhule the guilty party on a couple of occasions as Scott Scrafton, Akira Ioane and Patrick Tuipulotu taking the Blues back into the lead at 24-12.READ: Cheetahs relinquish 24-point lead, mauled 41-27All Black lock Tuipulotu was at the heart of the Blues dominance in the tight-loose, and he set up Steven Luatua s try early in the second half by cutting the line, before prop Charlie Faumuina offloaded in the tackle for Luatua.Scrumhalf Augustine Pulu, No 8 Rieko Ioane and Nanai added further tries to bring up the half-century for the Blues, but the Cheetahs added some respectability to the scoreboard at least.Replacement hooker Elandr Huggett barged over for a double from two lineout drives, but the game had already been won by the Blues well before the final quarter.

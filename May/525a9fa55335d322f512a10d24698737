JOHANNESBURG The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) at Kimberley Ekapa Mining Joint Venture (KEM JV) said on Monday that it was very concerned and disturbed by the manner in which the mine management was allegedly treating the workers and victimising its leadership at the mine.This comes after a slew of allegations of racism, suspensions, and ill-treatment of union members by mine management.READ: NUM to march against De BeersThe NUM said in a statement that it had tried, on several occasions, to engage the management and even invited the mine s executive to try and deal with the attitudes of senior management at the operations in the Northern Cape.NUM said racism was rife within the company, and that transformation was just window dressing .The union said a contractor called one of its members a baboon, and the company was reluctant to act until the union forced them to suspend the intransigent manager of the contractor.The NUM also alleged that one of its shop stewards was suspended for talking in his mother language. Another burning issue is the ill-treatment of the NUM branch leadership, especially the branch chairperson and secretary. There is an ulterior motive towards the two, the NUM said. The company failed to implement its own recruitment policies, which is a cause for concern and the company is busy recruiting people who don t have qualifications. The NUM vowed to fight to bring the perpetrators to book and end management's aberrant behaviour. It said that although the company claims to care about employees, all that it cares about is production.KEM JV representatives were not immediately available for comment on Monday.KEM JV came about when the London Stock Exchange-listed Petra Diamonds entered into a joint venture with South African-based diamond mining company, Ekapa Mining in July 2016.This resultant entity, which combined the companies respective operations, now houses the Kimberley underground mine, numerous tailings retreatment programmes and the central treatment plant.African News Agency

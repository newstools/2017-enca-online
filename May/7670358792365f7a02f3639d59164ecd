In October 2016, the government imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Mandera after al-Shabaab fighters killed 12 people at a hotel. The authorities also stepped up security in the region, with the curfew extended in April.Since 2007, al-Shabaab has fought to overthrow successive internationally-backed governments in Somalia but began attacking Kenya in 2011 after Nairobi ordered its troops into Somalia to fight the militants.Kenyan soldiers are now part of a 22,000-strong African Union mission fighting in Somalia. In 2013, al-Shabaab gunmen raided a shopping mall in the capital Nairobi killing 67 people, and in 2015 a similar attack on a university in Garissa left 148 dead.AFP

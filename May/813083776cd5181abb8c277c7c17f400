Opposition parties had mixed reactions.The department has a R10-billion budget for the 2017/2018 financial year and says it will use the bulk to speed up land redistribution by giving more teeth to the National Land Claims Commission. This is why now we are talking about turning the land claims commission into a Chapter 9 institution," said Nkwinti.Nkwinti says they re working on legislation to fast- track this.eNCA

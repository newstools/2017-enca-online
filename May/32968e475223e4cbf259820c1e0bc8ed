JOHANNESBURG The petrol price is set to drop in June, the Automobile Association (AA) said on Monday.The AA was commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. Our expectation for June is that petrol will drop by up to 26 cents a litre, with a 20 cent drop for both diesel and illuminating paraffin, the AA said in a statement.It said the Rand advanced against the US dollar during most of May, with further support from retreating international petroleum prices.READ: Petrol could increase by 55 cents a litre in May: AA Both of these factors have contributed to the reduction in the fuel price. According to the AA, OPEC's decision to continue its production cut for another nine months showed that there was concern in oil producing nations about a continued world oversupply of oil. It said this could mean a period of relative price stability. With political uncertainty set to continue, our medium-term outlook for the fuel price is that lower international petroleum prices will be key to maintaining local fuel price stability if the Rand weakens again, the AA said.eNCA

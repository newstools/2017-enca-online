The SABC today finished presenting its case and Mr Motsoeneng s legal representative requested a postponement for the following reasons, among others [the] recusal of the chairperson of the disciplinary hearing; [to] apply for protected disclosure at the CCMA [Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration] of the information that was said at the press conference; [and] interdicting the process through the Labour Court, Kganyago said.At the press briefing on 19 April Motsoeneng rubbished the SABC interim committee, appointed to fix the trail of destruction he is accused of having left at the public broadcaster.The defiant Motsoeneng is facing concurrent disciplinary hearings stemming from a Public Protector report that found that he lied about his qualifications, purged staff and increased his salary exorbitantly during his tenure at Auckland Park.The Western Cape High Court ruled in December that Motsoeneng's was unlawful and irrational and that he should not hold office until such time as a fresh disciplinary hearing cleared him of any wrongdoing, or if a court set aside the Public Protector s report.Motsoeneng s attempts to appeal the ruling failed.eNCA

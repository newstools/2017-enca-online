DOHA, Qatar Olympic champion Caster Semenya proved on Friday night in Doha that she has not lost that unbeatable aura she carried throughout last season.Competing at the opening IAAF Diamond League competition of the year, South Africa s Semenya easily won the women s 800m in 1min 56.61sec ahead of Kenya s Margaret Wambui.The women s 800m had been highly anticipated as Semenya went up against world 1 500m record holder Genzebe Dibaba in the Ethiopian s first ever 800m race.As it was, there was no contest as Semenya, who was last year s Diamond Trophy winner in the event and was unbeaten over the distance in 2016, continued her dominance ahead of Wambui s 1:57.03.Dibaba s 1:59.37 placed her fifth, behind Kenya s Eunice Sum and Ethiopia s Habitam Alemu.The race was paced by Britain s Jenny Meadows. The South African sat close to Meadows on the first lap before taking up the sole lead and moving away from the rest of the field.Olympic bronze medallist Wambui was the only athlete capable of covering the move, but Semenya crossed the line a comfortable winner. The race was fantastic and the field was great, said Semenya. I m looking forward to having great races; my only concern now is to finish my studies. I m left with two semesters, so I need to graduate and get my focus back on the track.

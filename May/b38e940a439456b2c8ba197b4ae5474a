JOHANNESBURG - Baroka FC will begin their battle for survival in top flight football when they face Stellenbosch FC at the Athlone Stadium in Cape Town on Wednesday, in the first of six promotion/relegation playoff matches.Baroka FC, who were edged into the playoffs by Free State Stars on goal difference on the final 2016/2017 Absa Premiership standings, know all too well of the hardships of the National First Division (NFD), having won the lower league title to secure promotion to top flight football two seasons ago.With the NFD champions Thanda Royal Zulu having already been promoted to the Absa Premiership at the expense of top league bottom club Highlands Park (NFD runners-up in 2015/2016), Baroka, will need to see off the challenges of NFD runners up Black Leopards and third-placed side Stellenbosch FC in round robin matches played on a home and away basis.READ: Wits too good for Polokwane, wins Premiership titleLimpopo-based Baroka will need no reminding of the difficulty of retaining their top flight status through the playoffs as the 15th placed teams in the Absa Premiership of the past two seasons in the form of Moroka Swallows and the University of Pretoria, both failed to see off the challenge from the NFD clubs.The fall from grace is a huge one, with Swallows having suffered three consecutive relegations and who will ply their trade in the SAB League (SAFA 3rd division) next season.Black Leopards are no strangers to the top flight, having been there on two previous occasions, and the Thohoyandou-based side, under the chairmanship of former PSL security chief David Thidiela, will be eager to return at the expense of Baroka FC. Lidoda Duvha, as Leopards are known, have a proud football history, with Bidvest Wits Absa Premiership title-winning coach Gavin Hunt, having been in charge of the team back in 2001/2002 when they finished in the Top 8.Stellenbosch FC, coached by former Free State Stars and University of Pretoria mentor Sammy Troughton with ex Amazulu coach Steve Barker as his assistant, and who formed a partnership between former Vasco da Gama and the Stellenbosch University at the start of the season, pipped Royal Eagles and the more-fancied Amazulu for third spot in the National First Division.Vasco spent the 2010/2011 season in the top flight before being relegated and struggled to get back, before doing a deal that included a name change, which allowed the club to use the Stellenbosch University s sports facilities and Coetzenburg stadium as a home venue.At the end of the day, the promotion/relegation tussle boils down to a money game, with an average top flight football club franchise estimated to be worth in the region of R50 to R60 million while a NFD franchise is usually on the market for between R8 and R10 million.The Absa Premiership clubs each receive a R1.5 million a month grant from the PSL while the NFD clubs receive R500 000 per month.PSL Promotion/Relegation matches:31 May 2017: Stellenbosch FC VS Baroka FC, Athlone Stadium (15h00)3 June 2017: Black Leopards vs Stellenbosch, Thohoyandou Stadium (15h00)7 June 2017: Baroka FC vs Black Leopards, Peter Mokaba Stadium (19h30)10 June 2017: Baroka FC vs Stellenbosch FC, Peter Mokaba Stadium (15h00)14 June 2017: Stellenbosch FC vs Black Leopards, Athlone Stadium (19h30)17 June 2017: Black Leopards vs Baroka FC, Thohoyandou Stadium (15h00) African News Agency

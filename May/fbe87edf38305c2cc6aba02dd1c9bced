JOHANNESBURG Three men were arrested and a task team appointed to investigate the murders of women in Gauteng after the bodies of three women were discovered, provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange said. Police will work around the clock to make sure that perpetrators are brought to book. It does not matter where they are hiding, she said in a statement. Criminals should not be allowed to do as they wish and to have a field day in terrorising our communities. They must be isolated by all members of the community.

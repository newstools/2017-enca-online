I own a four-star lodge around Port Shepstone and also have a little bit of business in property development," Musa Mseleku told eNCA's Ayanda Allie-Paine on the channel's weekend show on Sunday.MaKhumalo says MaNgwabe should recommend a fifth wife for her duties.

The wives reveal some tit-bits of their marriages, including how they deal with the intricacies that plague most relationships; jealousy, conflict and sharing their husband's time."We have tried a number of ways to make this work and I'm fortunate that I have wives that communicate and work out the logistics of where I spend my time," the father of 10 said.My new favorite show uThando Nesthembu!!!

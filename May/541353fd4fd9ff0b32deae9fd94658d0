UNITED STATES - A movie based on a tweet based on a Tumblr post has been bought at Cannes Film Festival, and it's the news 2017 needed. Ava DuVernay and Issa Rae Jump Onboard (at Least, on Social Media) the Rihanna/Lupita Nyong o Movie Idea https://t.co/q4cErLtEvO pic.twitter.com/EL5GBmcp9AIt all started in 2015, when Roxy Macdonald reblogged a Tumblr post of Lupita Nyong'o and Rihanna at a Miu Miu fashion event.Two years later, Twitter user @1800SADGAl took up the concept and posted it to Twitter -- this time adding that the two look as if they don't just scam anyone, but rich white men to boot. The internet is prosperous once more ------------ all hail @1800SADGAL https://t.co/IyZkrZuiIPTwitter erupted, willing the film into existence. First to opt in was Nyong'o.Writer Mikelle Street then called on Ava Duvernay to direct. Duvernay seemed the obvious choice, as the first black female director to have her film nominated for an Academy Award. We deserve nice things. -- https://t.co/VlbKhLNDIvAnd that was all it took. The film was hotly contested for at Cannes Film Festival this week, but Netflix nudged out multiple other suitors to come out on top. After a dramatic week at Cannes (many cinema lovers were vexed by the streaming site's presence), the company should certainly relish the win. #FanArtFriday @Mythallica giving life to Riri and Pit'z. #CashingIn pic.twitter.com/c0mpy9d5o2Issa Rae is currently working on the script, but her team have confirmed with Vanity Fair that the original creators of the idea will be credited and included in some form.

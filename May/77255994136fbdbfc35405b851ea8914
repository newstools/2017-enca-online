ABUJA - The United Nations on Monday welcomed the release of 82 Nigerian schoolgirls after years of Boko Haram captivity and appealed to their families and communities not to ostracize them.The teenage girls kidnapped in 2014 from a school in Chibok, northeast Nigeria, were freed on Saturday after a prisoner swap agreed with the Islamist group.One of the freed girls brought her infant son, according to a military official."We appeal to all Nigerians, including the families and local communities of the liberated girls, to fully embrace them and provide all necessary support to ensure their reintegration into society," UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

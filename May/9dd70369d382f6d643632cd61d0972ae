LOS ANGELES - Fight promoter Dana White says he has an agreement with mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor for a proposed megafight, but boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather remains unsigned.White told American television cable channel TNT on Wednesday night that McGregor has agreed to a boxing match and not a martial arts fight which heavily favours Mayweather, who has never lost in his two-decades long storied career.White said they still have a long way to go.But his plan now is to try to lure Mayweather out retirement for a superfight with McGregor."The McGregor side is done," Ultimate Fighting Champion president White said."I'm not saying the fight will happen but I got one side done and it's time to work on the other (Mayweather)."If we can come to a deal with (Al) Haymon and (Floyd) Mayweather, the fight's going to happen."READ: Mayweather-McGregor edging closer?White said that McGregor has agreed to step in the ring with the undefeated Mayweather despite not having fought competitively in a boxing ring since he was a teenager.McGregor was granted a license to box in California several months ago.McGregor, a 28-year-old Irishman, has been the UFC's most popular fighter and among its top money spinners while Mayweather, a 40-year-old American, retired in 2015 with a 49-0 record including 26 victories by knockout.White has said the fight could generate a payday of $100-million (R1.3-billion) for Mayweather and $75-million (R975-million) for McGregor.Mayweather has repeatedly said that he won't come out of retirement, against anyone, for less than $100 million.Not everyone would be excited to see a Mayweather-McGregor boxing match.Promoter Oscar De La Hoya has said a bout between the two would be an "embarrassment" for the sport of boxing.

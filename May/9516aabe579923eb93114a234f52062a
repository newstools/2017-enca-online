He is respected by his team-mates and opposition alike and has a lot of experience when it comes to captaincy, having led the Emirates Lions with great authority for many seasons. He is resilient, copes well under pressure and makes good decisions. The national selectors have rewarded form and we are looking forward to face the French team next month. I am confident the players will do the jersey and our country proud, said Coetzee. A lot of hard work has been done since the start of the season to make sure we improve as a team. The collaboration and spirit showed at the various indabas and other gatherings are proof that we are moving in the right direction. The three preseason training camps gave us the chance to have a close look at a number of players, especially those who haven t been involved with the Springboks previously. We were also kept abreast of the form and the progress of the overseas-based group of players, added Coetzee.The third training camp finished in Johannesburg on Tuesday morning, with Coetzee emphasising the importance of the training camps. I want to especially thank the franchise and conditioning coaches for their contribution towards the success of the training camps, according to the Bok coach.Flyhalf Pat Lambie is still symptomatic following his concussion. After discussions with the player and the medical teams of both the Springboks and the Cell C Sharks, it was decided not to consider him for selection for the Springbok squad.The Springbok squad for the Castle Lager Incoming Series:Forwards (18): Lood de Jager (lock), Vodacom Bulls 28 caps, 20 points (4 tries) Pieter-Steph du Toit (lock), DHL Stormers 20 caps, 15 points (3 tries) Ruan Dreyer (prop), Emirates Lions uncapped Eben Etzebeth (lock), DHL Stormers 54 caps, 10 points (2 tries) Steven Kitshoff (prop), Bordeaux B gles (France) 10 caps, 0 points Siya Kolisi (flank), DHL Stormers 16 caps, 0 points Jaco Kriel (loose forward), Emirates Lions 7 caps, 0 points Frans Malherbe (prop), DHL Stormers 15 caps, 0 points Malcolm Marx (hooker), Emirates Lions 2 caps, 0 points Bongi Mbonambi (hooker), DHL Stormers 5 caps; 0 points Oupa Mohoje (loose forward), Toyota Cheetahs 15 tests, 0 points Franco Mostert (lock), Emirates Lions 7 caps, 0 points Tendai Mtawarira (prop), Cell C Sharks 87 caps, 10 points (2 tries) Lizo Gqoboka (prop), Vodacom Bulls uncapped Coenie Oosthuizen (prop), Cell C Sharks 23 caps, 15 points (3 tries) Chiliboy Ralepelle (hooker), Cell C Sharks 22 caps, 5 points (1 try) Duane Vermeulen (loose forward), Toulon (France) 37 caps, 10 points (2 tries) Warren Whiteley (captain, loose forward), Emirates Lions 15 caps, 15 points (3 tries)Backs (13): Lukhanyo Am (centre), Cell C Sharks uncapped Andries Coetzee (fullback) Emirates Lions uncapped Ross Cronje (scrumhalf), Emirates Lions uncapped Damian de Allende (centre), DHL Stormers 22 Caps, 15 points (3 tries) Francois Hougaard (scrumhalf), Worcester (England) 39 caps, 25 points (5 tries) Elton Jantjies (flyhalf), Emirates Lions 11 caps, 78 points (12 conversions, 18 penalties) Jesse Kriel (centre), Vodacom Bulls 17 caps, 15 points (3 tries) Dillyn Leyds (wing/utility back), DHL Stormers uncapped Rudy Paige (scrumhalf), Vodacom Bulls 7 caps, 0 points Raymond Rhule (wing) Toyota Cheetahs uncapped Jan Serfontein (centre), Vodacom Bulls 26 caps, 10 points (2 tries) Courtnall Skosan (wing), Emirates Lions uncapped Frans Steyn (flyhalf/centre), Montpellier (France) 53 caps, 132 points (10 tries, 5 conversions, 21 penalties, 3 drop goals)African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - State-owned arms manufacturer Denel said on Tuesday that it was forging ahead to re-establish itself in the east Asian market via its joint-venture with VR Laser despite a high court bid to halt the undertaking.This comes after former National Treasury s director-general, Lungisa Fuzile, said in court papers that Gupta-linked VR Laser SA was a technically insolvent company and did not appear to be in a position to raise the funds that would enable VR Laser Asia to establish the joint-venture with Denel.READ: Denel denies capture by GuptasVR Laser Asia is owned by Salim Essa, an associate of the politically-connected Gupta family. Fuzile filed an affidavit with this claim in response to Denel s high court bid to acquire approval for the joint venture, Denel Asia.Denel wants to partner with Asian-based business of VR Laser as a vehicle to penetrate the Asia-Pacific markets.Reasons given by Denel to pursue this market include research showing that by 2018, the Asia-Pacific nations would command more than half of global defence procurement outside of the United States and two-thirds of non-US defence markets.In a statement on Tuesday, Denel said that this Asia-Pacific market was critical for any progressive global defence company, adding that it had conformed to all governance and statutory prescripts leading up to the formation of the Denel Asia joint venture.READ: Denel finally speaks out on Gupta dealThe state arms manufacturer said VR Laser Asia s proposition was found to be the next best opportunity given the financial commitment made risk-free to Denel, following a rigorous process to select a suitable partner.Zwelakhe Ntshepe, the acting group chief executive of Denel, said the financial commitment was adequately embedded into the shareholders agreement with the necessary default clauses to deal with the unlikely event when the commitment was not fulfilled.Ntshepe said that since its inception, Denel Asia had not traded and that this was on instruction from the Public Enterprises Minister and Denel board to allow the engagement process with National Treasury which was currently underway.Ntshepe said this delay and negative publicity around Denel Asia had cost the company valuable time in positioning Denel appropriately for export opportunities that would have been of huge advantage. The East-Asia market, in particular India, is the fastest growing defence market in the world. This is an important region for Denel to expand its business and find new markets for our world-class products, especially in the fields of artillery, armoured vehicles, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Ntshepe said.Ntshepe said they believe that Denel Asia was duly established after following and complying with all the relevant prescripts of the Public Finance Management Act. We need a firm foothold in this region and the establishment of Denel Asia was meant to give us a strong presence and the ability to pursue the desperately needed opportunities in that region, Ntshepe said.READ: Solidarity asks Madonsela to probe Gupta-Denel dealDenel Asia would have focused its marketing attention in the Asian region as most countries there had announced their intention to embark on major new defence acquisitions and grow their research and development budgets into the future.African News Agency

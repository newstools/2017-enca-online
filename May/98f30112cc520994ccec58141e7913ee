LOS ANGELES - American Idol may officially be coming back on ABC, but it s looking increasingly likely that none of the original Fox judging panel will be taking part.That s because Simon Cowell further confirmed this week he will not be involved in next season s reboot.In an interview with Extra on Thursday, the former judge revealed that the network had in fact reached out to him. I was asked to do it, and the answer is no, Cowell admitted. I have no interest. My memories are when we first started. It was a different time with Randy [Jackson], Ryan [Seacrest], and Paula [Abdul]. You can t recreate that. Cowell even claimed to not have watched American Idol in its later years after he exited the reality TV show in 2010 in favour of The X Factor. Last time I watched, it was not the same show, just the same name, Cowell conceded. I left for a reason and I never regretted that. As Variety has previously reported, Cowell is prevented from joining Idol due to his exclusive agreement at NBC, where he is a judge and executive producer for America s Got Talent. Ryan Seacrest is in advanced talks to reclaim his hosting duties now that he s permanently set up at ABC as Kelly Ripa s Live co-host.However, potential judges Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson will not be returning to the show that jump started their careers having already been cast on back-to-back seasons of The Voice.

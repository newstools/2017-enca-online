JOHANNESBURG - Do you remember how cold it was last weekend?The first big cold snap of winter brought some snow to the region.It also brought out the adventurous spirit of 4 by 4 drivers, who decided to tackle Sani Pass, with some interesting results.The top of the Sani Pass, after the first snowfall of 2017, is no place to get stuck, but thousands of snow-deprived South Africans caused a traffic jam of vehicles queuing to drive up the pass.Some even battled through blizzards, to get to ski resorts in Lesotho.Rob Ansell of Snow Report SA said, "South Africans don't see a lot of snow. So when it does happen, it becomes a bit of a novelty to them."After all, it's certainly more affordable than a trip to the Swiss Alps.With winter still ahead of us, weather experts say there will be more snow in the coming months.*View the attached video, courtesy of Snow Report SA, for more on this story. eNCA

PARLIAMENT - Political parties are calling for an investigation into Wednesday's altercation between members of the Black First Land First organisation and a senior MP during a committee meeting. Finance Committee MP Yunus Carrim and BLF's Andile Mngxitama nearly came to blows during a public hearing on economic transformation. Mngxitama allegedly called co-chairperson Joan Fubbs a fascist and Carrim reprimanded him. Parliament's speaker now wants tighter security measures around the legislature to be revisited. Baleka Mbete said both Mngxitama and CarrimÂ were at fault.

He claimed that while presenting in parliament, BLF was reportedly interrupted on multiple occasions by MPs. Mngxitama said that he responded that 'such treatment was fascist' to a statement by Fubbs saying that BLF was wasting time. He claimed that after BLF had finished their presentation and answered questions from MPs, he was confronted by Carrim. He insisted that the truth had been misrepresented by media saying, "Our people know the truth and know that it was not us who interrupted Parliament." eNCA

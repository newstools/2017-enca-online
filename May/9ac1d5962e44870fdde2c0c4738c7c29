BMW launched the all-new 5 Series sedan in Mzansi a few weeks ago and the car quickly claimed best of the best status with a number of motoring media.Now more derivatives are coming out thick and fast, including the new M550d xDrive that could finally make its way to Mzansi.While other markets like Europe did receive the previous-generation M550d xDrive, Mzansi could only take that engine if it came in an X5 or X6.The local outfit was never interested in selling all-wheel-drive sedans, despite evidence that its competitors were thriving in that category.The car uses an updated version of the 3.0-litre quadruple diesel turbo (yes, it has four turbos, just like the Bugatti Chiron), nestled under the bonnet.Maximum power is up to 294kW, while torque is now rated at 760Nm.Interestingly this car is quicker off the line than the outgoing M5, with a claimed 0 100km/h time of 4 seconds flat.Top speed is limited to the usual 250km/h, while average fuel consumption is said to be 5.9 litres per 100km.The M550d xDrive uses BMW s patented xDrive all-wheel-drive system, as well as an 8-speed automatic gearbox to send power onto the road.In contact with the surface are 19-inch alloy wheels that work with a standard M sports suspension, as well as Integral Active Steering, M sports brakes with blue calipers, and an M Performance twin tailpipe exhaust system.Some of the visible differences kitted on the car include a slightly different front grille, sporty bumper elements in a Cerium Grey colour, side air breathers in the same material, and the xDrive badge on one end of the boot lit.IN4RIDE

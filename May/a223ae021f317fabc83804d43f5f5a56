Last year we came second by 14 points, and I said to them as long as we improve this year, said the three-time championship-winning coach. I ve been here four years, we ve improved every year and that s all we need to keep doing. Keep improving, keep producing young players from our academy, which we do all the time. Our right-back Reeve Frosler has been outstanding, so that s what it s all about for me.

Landa's win has soothed the pain of yet another underwhelming campaign on the three-week Italian race, although the classy Basque rider hinted he might be looking for pastures new.When asked if he would still be with Team Sky next year, he said: "It's possible." Beginning the race as Sky's co-leader along with Welshman Geraint Thomas, their pink jersey ambitions ended on stage nine when both were among a group of riders brought down by a police motorcycle on the climb to Blockhaus.But while Thomas eventually pulled out due to injuries suffered in the spill, Landa ploughed on in the hope of claiming a stage -- and showing Sky he fully deserves their full support for a grand tour campaign by his own."I had a lot of problems in the first week so I had to refocus and my aim was to get here to the final week in good condition, and try to win a stage," added Landa."I tried very hard to win a stage this week, I came close yesterday (Thursday) and finally my efforts paid off."It shows that, if you still have the condition, you should never give up and to always believe in yourself."It's been a good third week for me and has confirmed to me that I should try to aim for a grand tour win myself in the future."AFP

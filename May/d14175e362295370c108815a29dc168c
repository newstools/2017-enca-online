BARCELONA - A drained but happy Lewis Hamilton hailed an "awesome" Sebastian Vettel on Sunday after winning a Spanish Grand Prix that the Briton described as the "rawest" of fights.The two rivals, with seven world championships between them, were in a race of their own at the Circuit de Catalunya as they lapped all but Red Bull's third placed Australian Daniel Ricciardo.Banging wheels, the one almost forcing the other off the road and getting hot under the collar as they fought for the lead, the Mercedes and Ferrari rivals produced a memorable thriller."That s how racing should be and I loved it and I wouldn t change it for the world," gushed triple champion Hamilton after chalking up the 55th win of his career to cut Vettel's championship lead to six points. ------ Lewis Hamilton wins the 2017 #SpanishGP!

This is why I race and this is what got me into racing in the beginning. To have that close battle with him, with a four-time champ, is awesome."Spain followed on from a difficult Russian weekend for Hamilton, the Briton finishing fourth in an overheating car.He might have been hot on Sunday, but the Mercedes was not the problem."From turn one to the end it was flat chat (full speed)," he said. "You re just using everything you ve got... to stay on (keep up with) Sebastian was a killer."Reuters

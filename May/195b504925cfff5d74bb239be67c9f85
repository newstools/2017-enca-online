The vehicles had been hijacked in various areas in and around Johannesburg and Pretoria, he said. The team also recovered a handheld radio and two firearms which will be ballistically tested to establish if they were used in the commission of any crimes. Approximately R600,000 in cash was also seized.

Further charges could well be added as investigations and liaison with the prosecuting authority continued. The suspects were expected to appear in the Lenasia Magistrate s Court on Monday. All role players are to be commended on this huge breakthrough which will undoubtedly disrupt organised carjackings and motor vehicle theft in Gauteng. As part of the implementation of the national trio crimes action plan, the SAPS is liaising and working closely with other role players in, inter alia, the security, banking, and vehicle industries and their support is appreciated. Investigations continue and more arrests cannot be ruled out, Naidoo said.African News Agency

CAPE TOWN - MPs have grilled Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini for government money spent on private security for her children. Parliaments Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Scopa,Â asked the minister to explain why R1-million was spent to protect her children. MPs say the minister had no right to use the money and should have called police if she believed her children were in danger. Dlamini says it was a provisional arrangement made with the social services department. She says the process of acquiring police services takes too long. eNCA

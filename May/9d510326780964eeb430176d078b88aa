By Toyota s standards, the new C-HR crossover is downright outlandish, flamboyant even, but based on the amount of attention it has garnered since its recent arrival, it s bound to resonate well in our market.Indeed demand for the C-HR is high and with only one production plant in Turkey making them, Toyota s 150-odd monthly allotment for South Africa should fly off showroom floors faster than you can say...C-HR. A new 1.2-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engine powers the C-HR with 85 kW and 185 Nm of torque on offer. A 6-speed manual transmission and CVT are available to buyers. Pricing starts at R318,500.The C-HR joins a booming crossover segment and it comes well-armed with sharp, progressive styling and attractive interior packaging that makes its rivals look rather ancient. However, most buyers are smart and for the C-HR to succeed, it will have to trump a host of formidable rivals on the road to sales success.Here are 5 cars that the new Toyota C-HR will need to beat.Suzuki VitaraThe Suzuki Vitara 1.6 GL+ won the Compact Family Car category in the annual Cars.co.za Consumer Awards and it attractively blends style, spaciousness, features, refinement and reliability. The Vitara range is powered by a naturally aspirated 1.6-litre engine that develops 86 kW and 151 Nm of torque with a 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmission on offer. Suzuki Vitara pricing starts at R267,900 for the 1.6 GL, but the ideal specification is probably presented by the 1.6 GL+, priced at R303,900.Consider buying if: You treasure reliability, economy and practicality at a good value price.Hyundai CretaThe Creta is also new to the crossover segment and even though it s a bit pricier, it offers attractive styling, a solidly built interior and lots of space for luggage and passengers. There are two engines available, a naturally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol engine with 90 kW and 150 Nm of torque, as well as a 1.6-litre turbodiesel engine with 94 kW and 260 Nm on offer.

The petrol range kicks off with the entry-level 0.9-litre turbopetrol engine with 66 kW and 135 Nm as well as a more powerful 1.2-litre turbopetrol engine delivering 88 kW and 190 Nm.

A 5-speed manual transmission is offered on all derivatives except the top-spec 88 kW turbopetrol derivative, which uses a 6-speed dual-clutch transmission.

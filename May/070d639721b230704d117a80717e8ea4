Thabo Matlaba nearly fashioned an opening for Pirates, but fluffed his final pass. The Buccaneers midfielder Abbubaker Mobara also tried his luck from range, but his attempt was saved by Wits goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs.Play continued to swing from end to end, and there were further opportunities for Pirates Thamsanqa Gabuza and Issa Sarr, while Wis winger Phakamani Mahlambi s dangerous-looking cross was well-dealt by the Soweto club s defence.READ: Baxter named new Bafana coachThe midfield exchanges were tough, the tackles hard and aggressive, and it was clear that a real scrap was on the cards. Neither side was prepared to give an inch and the half-time stalemate proved to be a tribute to the tight, tense encounter between two closely-matched teams.The excitement continued in the second half, with Pirates getting off to a quick start and Thabo Rakhale just failing to meet Patrick Phungwayo s cross at the far post.It was, however, Wits who took a 1-0 lead in the 56th minute when Mahlambi s good work created the opening for Cuthbert Malajila to score. The goal provided the Clever Boys with some impetus and chances accrued soon after to both Phumlani Ntshangase and Reeve Frosler, but one attempt was drilled wide and the other was cleared by the Pirates defence.READ: Hunt dismisses title talk, aims to improve on last seasonPirates Rakhale then a great chance to equalise, but his powerful shot was well-saved by Josephs. At the end, Gabadinho Mhango could have increased the Clever Boys advantage, but Pirates keeper Siyabonga Mpontshane pulled off an excellent stop.The Soweto club made a double substitution in the hope that it would provide some measure of inspiration in the search for an equaliser, with Tendai Ndoro and Thabo Qalinge replacing Ayanda Gcaba and Mpho Makola.Qalinge should then really have levelled when he had an inviting opportunity inside the penalty area, but unfortunately headed wide.Wits stayed compact and organised, and were able to play out the game and take the valuable three points.African News Agency

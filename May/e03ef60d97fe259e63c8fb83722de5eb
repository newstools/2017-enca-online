PRETORIA Mamelodi Sundowns lost what could prove a crucial two points in the title race when they drew 2-2 with struggling Platinum Stars at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Thursday night. #UPDATE: Sundowns drop points against #PlatinumStars@PlatinumStarsFC @IOLsport @Masandawana https://t.co/IfcROkbSHS pic.twitter.com/fkSquqe9OU The Tshwane side had to come from 2-1 down after a Ndumiso Mabena brace had put the North West club ahead 10 minutes into the second half. Although Downs were not at their clinical best in front of goal, the visiting side, who have been in poor form, should also get credit for a determined display.Sundowns were in dominant mood from kick off and went in front after just five minutes when defender Thabo Nthethe reacted sharply in the box to turn the ball in from close range after Dikwena had failed to clear a corner.READ: Wits beat Sundowns to go top of PremiershipNthethe nearly added a second goal just two minutes later when he flashed a header inches over the crossbar.Having survived the initial onslaught by conceding just the one goal, Stars began to play themselves back into the game and parity was restored in the 16th minute when a long throw-in reached Ndumiso Mabena, who took the ball past two defenders in the box before slotting home from 10-yards out.The remainder of the half remained tight, with only a couple more chance as Gerald Phiri sent a free kick onto the roof of the net for Dikwena, while Khama Billiat s 27th-minute effort was always rising over the goal.Downs started the second half with renewed vigour, but from against the run of play, Stars took the lead in the 55th minute when a quick free kick released Mabena, who sprinted onto the ball before thumping home a left-footed drive past Denis Onyango at the near post.But Cavin Johnson saw his side relinquish their advantage just eight minutes later when after a sustained spell of attacking from Sundowns, Yannick Zakri popped up the back post to fire the ball into the roof of the net after a long throw-in for what was his first league goal of the season.After Onyango did well to keep out Bongi Ntuli, Stars keeper Mbongeni Mzimela did superbly to deny Anthony Laffor at close range as the game burst to life.By now Sundowns had wrestled back control of the game, but they had to wait until the 85th minute before having another chance on goal, which saw Laffor firing over from the left-hand side of the box, for what was ultimately their last clear effort on goal as the visiting team threw bodies on the line.Stars, who had claimed only a point from their last five matches heading into the game, ended the match with 10 men after Sphamandla Mlilo was sent off in added time.African News Agency

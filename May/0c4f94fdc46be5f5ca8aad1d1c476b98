JOHANNESBURG - Seasoned political reporters Thulasizwe Simelane and Xoli Mngambi will bring a new focus to South African politics with the launch of their show PolitBureau. The show airs at 10:30am every Sunday from 21 May 2017. eNCA Channel News Director Mapi Mhlangu says eNCA is dedicating its top talent to helping viewers navigate the choppy political waters of 2017. Simelane and Mngambi have a record of asking the tough questions on issues that matter, of people who do not necessarily want to answer. They will now use this experience to examine South African politics on a weekly basis; what was said, who said it, what it means and sometimes what was not said, and why," she says.Simelane has more than 15 years experience in the media space and is a regular stand-in anchor on the channel. As a South African journalist, I feel privileged to live in a country where the media can still help citizens interpret the extraordinary political events of our time , says Simelane. In writing a history of our present, things look both strange and familiar. My experience as a journalist on the rest of the continent allows me to see South Africa ... in a special light. How do we learn from what has gone before, from our neighbours near and far, and avoid making the mistakes in Africa s post-independence political history. Mngambi, who joined the station in 2008, says he's ready to tackle a bigger anchoring role."I ve been talking to politicians and ordinary people since the road to Polokwane. A decade later I am struck by the echoes, but I am also intrigued by how much has been forgotten and how much people have erased, willingly or unwittingly. To live through these events and be given the privilege to help tell these ordinary and extraordinary stories of our times on a platform like eNCA: I am honoured." eNCA

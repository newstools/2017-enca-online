DURBAN Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret says the Nedbank Cup provides his side with a chance to salvage something from what has been a difficult campaign to date.The Buccaneers travel to Durban on Sunday to play Lamontville Golden Arrows with the opportunity to reach a second successive Nedbank Cup final.Pirates lost 3-2 to SuperSport United in the 2016 decider but can call on the memory of lifting the trophy in 2011 and 2014.Speaking after his side s 0-0 league draw with Ajax Cape Town on Wednesday that all but ended his side s hopes of a top eight finish, Jonevret says they need to pick themselves up for a difficult Nedbank Cup tie. It s a big chance for us in the cup. We just have to be braver when we have the ball but we need to stay as we were defensive, the Swede said. Our focus now from tomorrow is in getting this next game in Durban under the belt. Then we go back to the last league game and [Nedbank Cup] final. Jonevret feels his side did enough to beat Ajax, but again drew a blank. We knew that Ajax would play this way, for a point. This is what happens when sides like this come to Orlando. They were organised, he said. They played to their plan very well. We should have made our first half chances count, especially where we played well. We created enough chances to win tonight, but we didn t make them count. Defensively we have been difficult to beat. Tonight was a big night. We should have won this. Sunday we ll have a chance to salvage something from the season. African News Agency

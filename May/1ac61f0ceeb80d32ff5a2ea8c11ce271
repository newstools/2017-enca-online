JOHANNESBURG Germany rose to 22nd in the World Rugby Rankings, matching their highest ever position, after leaving it late to beat Kenya at the E.A. Union Ground, in Nairobi on Saturday. rugby: German Flyhalf Chris Hilsenbeck pierces Kenya Simba's hearthttps://t.co/FflTUTdkNo pic.twitter.com/8ThaG9k5ryFly-half Chris Hilsenbeck was the hero in Nairobi after he kicked a drop goal with the last act of the game for a 30-29 win, inflicting Kenya s first home defeat in almost three years.Up until then, Germany had dominated in the set-piece but it was Kenya who largely commanded the scoreboard, having led 12-3 at the end of the first quarter and then 26-15 around the hour mark.With influential eighthman, Martin Owila, in the sin-bin for a high tackle, Kenya came under intense pressure in the latter stages, but it looked as if they would hold on until Hilsenbeck struck. Simbas' Rugby tackles Germany, Sat 27/5/17 without 'hot' forward Martin Owila injured during Training at Barclays Bank Sports Club yesterday pic.twitter.com/1jDd8Jp3W3Germany had taken a first-minute lead from the boot of Raynor Parkinson only for Kenya to respond with tries from Eric Kerre, after good work in the build-up from Owila, and Captain Wilson K Opondo, the latter converted by Darwin Mukidza.Germany then used their powerful line-out maul to clinical effect, resulting in a try for Eric Marks, which Parkinson converted to make it 12-10 to Kenya at half-time.Three minutes into the second half, Germany went ahead after they pounced on a spilt pass in midfield to work a try for Kehoma Brenner. The advantage was short-lived, as Kenya scored two tries through Samson Onsomu and David Ambunya, both converted by Mukidza.Germany was not giving up the fight easily, though, and Sean Armstrong crossed for a converted try before Mukidza kicked a penalty to make the score 29-22 to the home side.When Harris Aounallah touched down with less than 10 minutes to play, it was all eyes on Hilsenbeck. Instead of levelling the scores though, the fly-half pushed his conversion attempt wide.Germany failed to turn their dominance into points, Hilsenbeck and Jamie Murphy both missing shots at goal as the clock ticked down.Just when it looked as though their chance of victory had gone, Germany managed to work one last attacking position for Hilsenbeck, who held his nerve to bring about a successful conclusion to what he later described as the hardest match I ve ever played in. The victory was worth 1.39 rating points to Germany, which is enough to lift them three places, above their vanquished opponents, as well as Canada and Portugal into 22nd place, a position they last achieved back in March.Rugby Europe Trophy winners Portugal lie in wait for the Czech Republic in the next stage of the European qualification process for Rugby World Cup 2019, after the Czechs saw off Hungary 47-19.With more than 40 places separating the Czechs from Hungary in the rankings, the scoreline came as little surprise to the majority of those in attendance at the Tatra Sm chov Stadium in Prague on Saturday.Backs Adam Soural, Ji Pant ek, Ale Stejskal and Zbyn k Sch tz scored first-half tries in addition to one from number eight Marek Loutock , as the Czechs led 33-12 at the break. Both of Hungary s tries came from outside centre Mark Stiglmayer.Hungary closed the gap to just two scores eight minutes after the restart, when flanker Andrew Zair crossed the line and the versatile Martin Sacase, who had switched from fly-half to scrum-half for this match, added the conversion.The score stayed at 33-19 until the 65th minute when Loutock bagged his second try. Pant ek did likewise with five minutes to go, to round off a good win for the home side.Despite the win, they drop a place to 32nd after the half point that Brazil picked up, for beating Paraguay 57-6 in the Sudam rica Rugby A Championship on Friday, took them above the Czechs.Uruguay was once again crowned Sudam rica Rugby A Championship winners, following a 27-11 victory over Chile in the title-deciding game in Montevideo on Saturday. They gain five-hundredths of a point as a result of the win, but that still leaves them just under a point short of replacing Russia in the world s top 20.Meanwhile, Hong Kong is up to two places to 25th in the rankings after their six-try, 43-17 away win against Korea in Yesan came with a 1.8-point reward on Saturday. Korea drop one place to 29th.The victory also gives Hong Kong the advantage in the contest for second place in the Asia Rugby Championship, ahead of the final round on Saturday. They are now on five points in the overall standings, with Korea stuck on one.Jamie Hood converted tries from James Cunningham, Tyler Spitz and Lex Kaleca as Hong Kong built up a 21-0 lead before Korea got a score of their own on 36 minutes through Kim Gwong Min. Hood, however, ensured Hong Kong had the final say of the first half with a penalty on the stroke of half-time.Yiu Kam-shing secured the try bonus point for Hong Kong three minutes after the break, before Spitz scored his second try of the match, and third of the championship, shortly thereafter to put the game well and truly to bed. Winger Ally Maclay outsprinted the defence for Hong Kong s sixth, and Hood s only unsuccessful conversion attempt of the day left the score at 43-5.Korea came back to score two tries in the final quarter and briefly threatened to collect the bonus point, but Hong Kong s defence held strong, leaving the final score at 43-17.African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG The Sunday Times and City Press are reporting on a series of damning emails which detail the Gupta family s alleged influence over President Jacob Zuma.The two Sunday papers report that the controversial family is at the heart of a scheme to provide Zuma with residence in the United Arab Emirates, but he has rubbished the claim.The emails appear to confirm a number of claims around state capture. They reveal that Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane's CV was given to the Guptas a month before his appointment.That the Guptas allegedly tried to give former Communications Minister Faith Muthambi more power and that the family paid for Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen to go to Dubai after he was appointed to cabinet.Both van Rooyen and Zwane are yet to respond to the allegations.The Sunday Times reports that last year two draft letters were circulated from Tony Gupta to Gupta owned Sahara CEO Ashu Chawla Chawla and then to Zuma s son Duduzane requesting Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Moktoum their "guidance and direction" for making the United Arab Emirates his second home."It is with this sentiment that I am happy to inform you that my family has decided to make the UAE a second home. It will be a great honour for me and my family to gain your patronage during our proposed residency in the UAE," Zuma allegedly wrote in the email. eNCA

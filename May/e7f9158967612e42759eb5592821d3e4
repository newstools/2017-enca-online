I welcome @LeoDiCaprio and @World_Wildlife 's concern regarding the Vaquita Marina. .@Mexico has focused all its efforts to prevent the extinction of this species. Since Feb/2015, we have eliminated one of its main causes of death: the shrimp and scale fishery, establishing a two-year ban on the area. .@SEMAR_mx -Mexico's Navy- has more than 300 marines, 15 boats and unmanned aircraft systems watching over this area. Mexico's government is making a major effort, doing what should have been done decades ago to save the Vaquita Marina. Mexico imposed a two-year ban on gillnet fishing in the vaquita's habitat in 2015, extending it earlier this year.Still, critics have complained the ban needs better enforcement.Our government has also extended the protection zone to a surface three times larger than the original. Viva Vaquita, a group dedicated to saving the porpoise, says on its website that the vaquita population was estimated to be below 50 in January 2017, based on earlier study findingsVisit https://t.co/yhTPVC4sby to learn more about Mexico's efforts to protect the Vaquita.Reuters

Water Restrictions to be implemented with immediate effect in Nelson Mandela Bay pic.twitter.com/XoL3atMu9d We are faced with a crisis simply because a water provision canal has collapsed which has made it even more important that we save water, said Trollip.MMC for Safety and Security, John Best, said that a legislative process was underway for the disaster to be promulgated into the provincial gazette. Once the gazette is promulgated and it is published then we can apply to government for additional financial assistance. We believe the the process can take up to a week, said Best.

It is a substantial amount of water, we don t in anyway want to put across a message that it is okay to use 40 kl a month. It is probably okay to use between 10-15 kl per month per household at this stage, said Lovemore.Contractors will have to use recycled water from Fishwater Flats.African News Agency

The Danes might have a national obsession with cosying up for winter (hygge), but the Germans understand all about feeding body and soul with comfort food. I couldn t agree more: Once the cold sets in, hearty sauerbraten (sour roast), potato dumplings and rohtkol (sweet-sour cabbage); pea soup; cabbage rolls; and especially goulash soup do the trick.High on the slopes of the Simonsberg Mountains in Stellenbosch, you won t find much German comfort food on the cards, even though Delheim wine estate has been in German hands since 1938. The Sperling family s estate does focus though on offering Gem tlichkeit a word that has no direct equivalent but translates broadly as cosiness, warmth and hospitality by the bucket-load.The Sperlings are renowned in wine circles. Michael Hans Spatz Sperling, the patriarch, was a maverick in his day and instrumental in establishing the country s first wine route in the 70s. Since those early days, Delheim s been popular with locals and tourists alike: tastings are held inside their Downstairs cellar, where guests are welcomed with a cool glass of water from the farm s own natural springs in summer or gl hwein in winter.In recent times, there s a fun cupcake and wine pairing on offer but for serious tasting, it costs just R50 per person for any five wines. Don t forget to book a cellar tour, which takes you past the concrete tanks (built by Italian prisoners-of-war).For a light nibble, you could order a platter for two in the cellar (cheese, preserves, cold cuts, bread and fruit for R185), a picnic basket (R460 for two, summer months only) or head on to the Garden Restaurant, which has had chef Bruce von Pressentin in charge of the kitchen since 2015.Formerly of Cassia and Longridge, Bruce has an impressive r sum , with local and international experience, which is evident in his confident approach to contemporary European cuisine.This being our first meal at Delheim, I was struck by the ambitious menu for a restaurant on a wine estate so far from town, but left seriously impressed. Their motto: Worth the Journey , is certainly fitting. I had expected average bistro fare: instead, Bruce s team delivered rather posh plates of perfection, rich with texture, colour and flavour.We shared a delicious starter platter of mild Cape Malay beef samoosas, rich lamb neck springrolls, a peach and cucumber atchar, and curried onion and coriander beignets (fritters similar to chilli bites). Samoosas aren t often something to rave about but these had such a lovely, lingering flavour I was hesitant to ruin it with the next course. So, we persevered to the next course.He had the slow-braised beef short rib, served with an earthy, creamy celeriac pur e, crisp string beans, shimeji mushrooms, pickled shitake, roasted beef marrow and beef jus rub; while I couldn t resist the duck breast: this was panfried till beautifully browned on the edges but bright pink as a rose bud on the inside.Served with lightly charred artichoke, pear and saffron; a quinoa, rabbit and leek terrine; pak choi and a chenin cream sauce, it was paired with the estate s Sur Lie Chenin.Other menu options included a herb-crusted linefish with pancetta, kidney beans and olive cassoulet; bratwurst with saut ed baby potatoes, pickled cabbage, mustard and a pork jus; ostrich bobotie with the trimmings; a slow-roasted Moroccan lamb shank with saute d baby potatoes, seasonal vegetables, olives, harissa, a yogurt dressing; and a delicious sounding Malay chicken curry with apricot chutney. All the estate s wines are available in the restaurant, whether by the glass or by bottle, including their fabulous Wild Ferment Chenin, the top-drawer Vera Cruz Shiraz named for the matriarch of the family, naturally and the flagship red, the Grand Reserve, which is only released in stellar years.This classically styled cabernet sauvignon is produced from grapes grown on the cool slopes of the nearby Vera Cruz property, aged in small, new French oak barrels (which impart firm tannins to support long-term ageing).Last year, Delheim celebrated the 40th anniversary of its fresh and fruity Pinotage Ros a blend of mostly pinotage with a touch of Muscat de Frontignan with a mini facelift in the form of a cleaner label design. It tastes of spring but you don t have to wait for the seasons to warm up: this will be perfect at lunch with their aromatic Cape Malay chicken curry or a hot and spicy Thai number.Their popular Jazz and Cheese Fondues run throughout winter. This month though, they re focussing on Cape Malay cuisine.The exclusive menu is served every Saturday and only open to entire tables: think beef and veg samoosas; curried yellowtail; butter chicken; denningsvleis (curried lamb stew, richly infused with tamarind); beef biryani; potato and green-bean bredie followed by koeksisters, boeber (also known as melkkos) and stick bread served with butter and jam.Next month, it s foraging time with mushroom fundi Gary Goldman, who will take you through the picking and cleaning process, before you sit down to a mushroom-themed food and wine experience.

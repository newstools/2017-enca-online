GENEVA, Switzerland - The United Nations said Monday that $1.4-billion (R18.5-billion) was needed this year alone to help the nearly two million people who have fled war and famine in South Sudan."The suffering of the South Sudanese people is just unimaginable," World Food Programme chief David Beasley said in a statement, adding that many are "close to the abyss".South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, descended into civil war in December 2013, just two years after it split from the north.Tens of thousands of people have been killed since then, with 1.8 million forced to flee the country, including about one million children, to seek refuge in Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.Another two million have been displaced inside the country, but they are not covered by Monday's appeal.

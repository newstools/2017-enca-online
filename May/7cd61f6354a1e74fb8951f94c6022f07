Authorities may have helped it on its way by playing a continuous loop of humpback whale feeding sounds overnight near the harbor s entrance-exit point.The idea was to draw the whale toward the open water under the belief there would be something good to eat.Read: Whale set free after marathon rescueThe 40-foot-long creature had wowed boaters and passers-by on shore for hours Saturday after it arrived in the small fishing harbor north of Los Angeles.People stood on small boats and docks watching it swim back and forth and occasionally surface.Whale experts told Higgins it appeared to be a healthy juvenile, although he didn t know its age.The Coast Guard, National Parks Service, authorities and volunteers spent hours trying unsuccessfully to shepherd it back to the ocean.Read: Whale cams reveal secret Antarctic feeding habitsAfter blocking its path with boats and banging on pipes failed to work, they tried the whale feeding sounds.

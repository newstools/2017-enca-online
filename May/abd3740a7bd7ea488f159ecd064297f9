BLOEMFONTEIN In one of the most extraordinary Super Rugby games for many a year, each team scored six tries in a thrill-a-minute match ultimately won 45-41 by the Dunedin team Highlanders over the host side Cheetahs.The Cheetahs seemed to have it sewn up with a 17-point lead with seven minutes to go but the Kiwis hit back with a stunning burst of points.The Highlanders had won eight of their last nine games against the Cheetahs and were overwhelming favourites to stretch that record.But the plucky home side had other ideas and stuck to their season-long script of running just about anything, and were handsomely rewarded in the 7th minute when Sergeal Petersen broke out down the touchline from his 22 and fed inside for scrumhalf Tian Meyer to sprint to the corner flag for a spectacular score.And soon after flyhalf Fred Zeilinga added three more points with a well-taken penalty for an 8-0 lead. The Highlanders had also started the game in adventurous mood but chose to go for posts in the 20th minute and flyhalf Marty Banks was on target.Banks was back in business a few minutes later when a culmination of slick phases opened a gap for him to saunter through for a try under the crossbar. His conversion put his team in front at 10-8.There was disappointment for the Cheetahs when an entertaining team build-up saw Petersen score a lovely try that was disallowed because a Highlanders defender had been obstructed from making a tackle. One of the great comeback wins!#FullTime #CHEvHIG #HighlandersANDYou pic.twitter.com/a0X4nTjJDA Five minutes before half-time, the visitors suffered a blow when their fullback, Matt Faddes was sin-binned for a stiff-arm tackle on Raymond Rhule. The Cheetahs immediately capitalised on having the extra man when they stretched the ball wide and Petersen sped in at the corner, with Zeilinga nailing the difficult conversion for a 15-10 lead.In a dramatic development, as the half-time was hooter was sounding and the Highlanders were camping on the Cheetahs line, lock Tom Franklin charged into a ruck with no use of the arms and was penalised, letting the Cheetahs off the hook.There was misfortune for the visitors shortly after the break when replacement prop Siate Tokolahi was yellow-carded for a tip tackle on Paul Schoeman, meaning the Highlanders were down to 13 men for a few minutes.Again the Cheetahs capitalised on their numerical advantage when they kicked the penalty to the corner and hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld scored off the back of the lineout charge. Zeilinga s conversion pushed the lead out to 22-10.That lead was short-lived. Highlanders centre Rob Thompson broke through after a loose kick from Zeilinga and scored near the uprights and a few minutes later a sweeping counter-attack put wing Waisake Naholo in for a converted try, and a 24-22 lead. @CheetahsRugby played their hearts out!!! Congrats with the win @Highlanders pic.twitter.com/4Uyb5D1f3N The Cheetahs bounced back superbly when slick handling by the backs resulted in flank Oupa Mohoje being unmarked on the touchline and he raced home for the try in the corner, which was well converted by Zeilinga.The kick-off had barely been taken when Rhule neatly chipped over the defence and the ball bounced kindly for Meyer to score his second try, and the Cheetahs were suddenly 34-24 ahead as the game hit the three-quarter mark.READ: Cheetahs coach Smith relishing challenges as they take on the HighlandersIt just kept getting better for the Cheetahs when they scored a marvellous team try that saw most of the forwards handle before Ox Nche scored his team s sixth try. The conversion made it 41-24.The two teams had scored six tries in 22 minutes of fantastic rugby.There was a twist eight minutes from time when Cheetahs flank Uzair Cassiem was binned for a high tackle near his team s tryline and while the defence held firm for a few minutes, Richard Buckman eventually scored, and then the home fans were stunned when a minute later Faddes scored from a breakout from the Cheetahs 22, and it was 41-38 to the Cheetahs with two minutes to go.There was almost an inevitability about the dying seconds when the Highlanders scored after the hooter through Naholo, his team s third try in five minutes.African News Agency

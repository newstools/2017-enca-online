The situation in the region is worrying," said Herve Verhoosel, a MINUSCA spokesman.The Moroccan royal armed forces separately said in a statement from Rabat that the body of the Moroccan peacekeeper had been returned, and that another wounded soldier remained in serious condition.The ambush of the UN convoy took place on the Rafai-Bangassou axis, some 140 miles (220 kilometers) southeast of the city of Bria.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the Security Council have strongly condemned the attack and called for those responsible to face justice.Meanwhile, the military mission of the European Union said the first battalion of 650 Centrafrican soldiers which trained by the mission was presented to authorities in Bangui on Thursday.

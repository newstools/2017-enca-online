PORT ELIZABETH The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Tuesday issued a warning to residents to be mindful of letting children fly kites close to electricity cables.In a statement, the municipality said that as Energy Month is celebrated in May, the City would like to send a strong warning to parents and guardians to closely guard and prevent their children from flying kites close to electricity cables, as this poses the serious risk of electrocution .The City said the warning followed a growing number of incidents where kites flown close to or under electric cables had entangled themselves around electric cables, resulting in cables touching each other. These incidents had led to a number of electricity distribution cuts in a number of areas, more especially in the Northern Areas of the city. The Municipality s Electricity and Energy Directorate has warned that the flying of kites near or under electric cables poses a risk, because the electric cables are live and carry high electricity voltage, which could cause instantaneous death on contact. The municipality also appealed to parents and guardians to closely monitor their children to refrain from fiddling with electricity installations in their neighbourhoods.African News Agency

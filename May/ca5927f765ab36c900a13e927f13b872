GENEVA - Five UN workers at a refugee camp in north-west Kenya were allegedly involved in fraud and other serious misconduct, the UN refugee agency said Tuesday.One staff member was arrested after the agency referred three workers at the Kakuma camp to Kenyan police for criminal prosecution, according to the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). "Protecting lives is at the core of UNHCR's work, which makes the betrayal of trust we have seen in this case so galling," said deputy head of the UNHCR George Okoth-Obbo.The UNHCR launched an internal investigation after receiving allegations of fraud, corruption, threats and intimidation in the camp, it said.Two of the workers have since resigned and disciplinary actions are being taken against the other three.The agency also suspended resettlement applications for the camp, it said. UNHCR investigations are carried out by the organisation s Inspector General s Office, an independent body which reports directly to the High Commissioner.AFP

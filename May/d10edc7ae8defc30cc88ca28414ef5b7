TERME LUIGIANE - Retirement-bound Francesco Totti said he remains focused on helping Roma secure a top-two finish despite the prospect of watching from the bench when they bid to stop Juventus securing the Serie A title on Sunday.The 40-year-old Totti ended months of speculation over his future by confirming this week he is ready to work alongside sporting director Monchi when he hangs up his boots at the end of the month.Known as 'Il Re di Roma' (King of Rome) for the best part of a career spent entirely with Roma, Totti will be given a farewell worth of royalty when they host Genoa on his swansong on May 28.Despite a decidedly underwhelming end to a storied career that has been overshadowed by sporadic, cameo appearance from the bench and disagreements with club officials, Totti says he remains committed to the cause.READ: Totti to retire at end of season"We have Juventus against Roma on Sunday, that's all I'm thinking about because we want to fight all the way to the end in this championship, and Roma comes first," said Totti."There will be plenty of time to talk (about me) afterwards."With a seven-point lead on Luciano Spalletti's hosts and three games remaining, Juventus need just a point at the Stadio Olimpico to secure a record sixth consecutive 'scudetto', and the first trophy of a targeted treble.Massimiliano Allegri's men face face Lazio in the Italian Cup final on May 17 before focusing on Real Madrid in the Champions League final on June 3.But Allegri is keen to make sure Juve get the job finished quickly."We'll go into the final looking to win, but in the meantime we can't forget we need a point against Roma.

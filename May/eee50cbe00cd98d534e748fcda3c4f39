JOHANNESBURG - A two-week-old boy has died after allegedly inhaling teargas during a housing protest in Durban's Foreman Road informal settlement.The teargas was thrown by police to disperse the protesting residents.Receive Khoza, the father of the baby, Jayden said although the teargas canister was thrown behind their yard, the smoke went into his home."My two-week old child was inside. When I went to go check on him he was struggling to breathe."The protest was organised by the shack-dwellers' movement Abahlali Base Mjondolo, which accuses the eThekwini municipality of ignoring housing demands.Now the fight has claimed an innocent life, they say.Abahlali Basemjondolo president Sbu Zikode said: "Police came and then they started their violent behaviour. They started shooting three stun grenade, they have also attacked people right in the shack settlements and that s when they threw teargas, which led to the child inhaling it to death."The municipality concedes that there are housing backlogs and that it plans to deal with them. "In the next three years we are going to build about 14,700 houses and we are going to acquire about 300 hectares of land, which will be able to assist us in moving forward," said eThekwini mayoral spokesperson Mthunzi Gumede.Police say post-mortem results will determine the exact cause of baby Jayden's death.KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Thulani Zwane said: "We are still waiting for the postmortem results that will determine how the child died, but early this morning we attended to a complaint about people who were protesting in the area. They were blocking the road using burning tyres as well as stones. They were complaining of [inadequate] service delivery." The community has vowed to continue protesting until its complaints are addressed.eNCA

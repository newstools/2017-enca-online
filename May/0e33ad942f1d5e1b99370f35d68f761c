Although State Security is the government agency responsible for keeping the secrets of the state and ensuring that sensitive information is kept secure, we now see that the manner in which state security operates and hides its budget from parliament is problematic," said Karabo Rajuili."We re seeing an increase in the number of corruption scandals and wasteful and irregular expenditure happening at state security. Mahlobo s department has recently come under scrutiny after he distanced himself from an intelligence report President Jacob Zuma is believed to have used in his axing of former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Rajuili says this is an example of an agency that operates with no consequences. State security seems to be getting distracted by matters that are outside of its purvey of work, so it s getting caught up in factional battles the seems to be evidence of mismanagement within state security as well which suggests a department which is losing its own direction. For we ll have to wait to see what Mahlobo has up his sleeve when he presents his budget.eNCA

PORT ELIZABETH The Kings from the Eastern Cape have been depleted by injury this season, but are keeping their spirits up, in the wake of some improved performances of late and the reward of four of their players with invitations to the third Springbok training camp from May 21 to 23.The Kings have won their last three consecutive matches in Super Rugby the away victory over the Waratahs in Sydney and two home matches against the Rebels and the Sharks.Kings flanker Chris Cloete sustained a concussion in last weekend s victory over the Sharks. In accordance with the World Rugby concussion protocol, he will not be available for their Super Rugby clash against the Brumbies at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Saturday.He will have to satisfy the return-to-play requirement next week before facing the Lions at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on May 28.Fullback Masixole Banda is also out with a hamstring injury and will undergo scans to determine how long he will take before returning to action. It is almost sure that he will not be available for the Brumbies encounter, according to team doctor, Konrad von Hagen.Compounding the bad news is the continued absence of flank CJ Velleman, 22, who will be devastated by damaging the same knee (which kept him out with injury for so long) in training last week. Now he will have to undergo knee surgery.Also out with a knee injury was prop Justin Forwood, which he incurred in the Kings victory over the Rebels in April. On a positive note, his surgery on Monday was a success. He will have to wait until 2018, though, to return to rugby as the recovery will take nine months.The injury list includes loose forward Ruaan Lerm (ankle), who may be available for selection for this week s match, and Malcolm Jaer (knee), who is also making progress.Von Hagen mentioned that the recovery of scrumhalf Rudi van Rooyen (ankle), lock Cameron Lindsay (knee) and prop Schalk Ferreira (biceps) is also on track.Meanwhile, Charl Crous, chief executive of the Southern Kings has been delighted by the invitation of captain and flyhalf Lionel Cronje, loose forwards Andisa Ntsila, Chris Cloete and wing Makazole Mapimpi to the imminent third Springbok training camp.He said: Lionel Cronje, Andisa Ntsila, Chris Cloete and Makazole Mapimpi have done well in what has been an impressive team effort by all involved in ensuring that the Southern Kings enjoy the good results we have had this season. This call-up for the players is reflective of the hard work that has been put in by the head coach, Deon Davids, his coaching staff, the rest of the Southern Kings players and staff since the pre-season build-up. We wish our players, and the rest of the Springbok extended squad the very best for the camp. Kings coach, Deon Davids, added: Given the fact that all four of these players are born and bred in the Eastern Cape, it is a reflection of the continued amount of talent that is at our disposal in the region. It is indicative of the fact that the province continues to manufacture quality players who can add value to South African rugby.The Kings can also be proud of wing Yaw Penxe, who has been selected as part of the Junior Springbok squad who will compete in the World Rugby Under-20 Championship in Georgia from May 31 to June 18.African News Agency

The fastest car around the N rburgring s 20.8km Nordschleife is Chinese. Yes, a new track record has been set by a car not from Germany, Italy, Japan or the USA.The new boss is from China and surprisingly, all-electric too. Made by the NIO brand, the new EP9 hypercar does not have a V8, V10 or V12, but instead uses electric power to propel it to a stunning 6 minutes 45.9 seconds around the green hell . In October 2016, we aimed to set a new lap record for an electric vehicle with our NIO EP9, said Gerry Hughes, Head of Performance Program & FE Team Principal, NIO. In the incremental weather that the N rburgring Nordschleife is known for, the EP9 completed two laps of the 20.8 km (12.9m) Green Hell , one of which was in 7m 05.12s, beating the previous EV lap record, making it the fastest electric car in the world."The EP9 s new lap record is 19.22 seconds faster than its previous lap time. This is a fabulous achievement for NIO and I am very proud of the team that has worked tirelessly to achieve this accolade. NIO, which is totally unknown to ordinary members of the public, has its global headquarters in Shanghai, China. But it also has offices in Munich, London and San Jose.The company plans to produce global electric vehicles, such as sedans and SUVs in the near future.For now, its only product, which you can purchase for US$1.48 million (about R19 million).The car s electric powerplant makes 1MW (1,000kW) and 1,480Nm of torque all the way from 0 7,500rpm, which helps it to accelerate from 0 200km/h in 7.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 313km/h.So aerodynamic is the EP9 that NIO says it has twice the downforce generated by a Formula One car.Its battery can be recharged in 45 minutes.IN4RIDE

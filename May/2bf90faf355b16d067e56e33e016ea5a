JOHANNESBURG Libya s Benina Airport, in Benghazi in the east of the North African country, is due to open again on 16 May, on the third anniversary of its forced closure in 2014 following the country s deteriorating security situation.Security sources in the country told the Libya Herald on Tuesday that a slight improvement in the security situation made the reopening of the airport possible.In February, the airport management asked the Libyan National Army (LNA) for permission to restart civil flights, saying that it was now safe to reopen.READ: Libya general's forces linked to war crimesFollowing the request, there were several one-off VIP flights to and from the airport.This was followed by the civil aviation authorities granting permission for all cargo, air ambulance, humanitarian and VIP flights to resume at the beginning of April as the final step before fully reopening.However, the fighting in the area has not stopped completely and it is thought that the resumption of commercial flights to and from Benghazi sends a powerful message to the militants that they are losing the war.Meanwhile, Libya s economy remains in crisis.Members of Libya s Presidency Council, including its head Fayez Serraj, and members of the Tripoli-based House of Representatives (HoR), met in the capital in an endeavour to discuss solutions to the current financial and economic problems facing the country.Organisers reported that the meeting included the HoR Finance Committee, the Government of National Accord s (GNA) Finance, Planning and Economy Ministries, the Tripoli-based Audit Bureau, the Tripoli-based Administrative Control Authority, the Economy Committee in the High State Council, the Economic Development Council and the General Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry.However, the Central Bank of Libya failed to show.The negative effects of the liquidity crisis and the fall in the value of the Libyan dinar on the economy, the standard of living on citizens and mechanisms to exit the crisis were discussed at length.African News Agency

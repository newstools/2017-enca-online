CAPE TOWN - Delayed revisions to South Africa's Mining Charter, which sets industry targets for black ownership and participation in the sector, will be published and become law in the next few weeks, President Jacob Zuma said on Wednesday.The mining industry has complained that it has not been consulted enough about the revisions and that South Africa's mining industry is losing badly needed investment as a result.The government said last week the revisions, which were expected in March, had been approved.Zuma confirms Minerals Minister Zwane's announcement that the Mining Charter will be gazetted in coming weeks. #PresidencyBudgetThe president was speaking in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, his first appearance since the Cabinet reshuffle in March and since news reports of his apparent plan to relocate himself and family to the United Arab Emirates.Zuma said a Commission of Inquiry into the extent of state capture would establish the fact and remove rumours.#PresidencyBudget Zuma on #StateCapture.

This is the second raid in the area, last week police made a grim discovery when they pounced on what appeared to be a barbershop and found five kidnapped teenagers, drugs and pornographic material. Police say there may be more houses like these. Makhubela implored, "we are calling for those who know those places to come forward and those who are in those places and feel that they can have a chance to go to the police station, they can run to the police station and inform the police. They will go and rescue them by arresting all who are in there.” eNCA

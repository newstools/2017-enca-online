JOHANNESBURG – Twitter exploded on Tuesday as users took up the  #MampintshaChallenge. The challenge was prompted by the rants by singers Babes Wodumo and her producer bae, Mamphintsha, after the South African Music Awards (Samas). READ: Babes Wodumo lashes out at #SAMA23 The Wololo hitmaker Wodumo was nominated for four awards but walked away empty-handed from the 23rd Samas at Sun City at the weekend. She and Mampintsha took to social media to vent, accusing the awards of being bought. Their record label, West Ink Records, however, has issued a statement apologising for the artist's outbursts. "We therefore wish to apologise to all our supporters and society in general for the outburst by some of us soon after the Samas ceremony. This unfortunate situation was due to a number of calls we were receiving from thousands of music lovers who were disappointed about outcomes of the ceremony," the label said. #MampintshaChallenge

UMKOMAAS Three scuba divers have been found safe after an extensive search was launched when they got separated from their dive boat off Umkomaas, south of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Saturday.NSRI Durban duty crew were activated about 2.30pm on Friday by the Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) following reports of three scuba divers missing from their dive boat during a dive at Aliwal Shoal, offshore of Umkomaas, NSRI Durban station commander Clifford Ireland said.READ: Umkomaas death toll drops to 14This followed an initial search by the dive boat. NSRI Durban dispatched a sea rescue vehicle and the sea rescue craft Eikos Rescuer II was placed on alert. NSRI Shelly Beach towed the sea rescue craft Spirit of Dawn to be launched at Umkomaas and NSRI Port Edward dispatched a sea rescue vehicle to join a shoreline search, he said.The NSRI air-sea rescue (ASR) were activated to initiate an air search, and the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) initiated a search pattern. A total of eight local dive boats and private boats from the area had launched to join the dive boat searching for the three divers, while local dive companies dispatched 4 4 vehicles to help in a shoreline search, Ireland said. During the search carried out by the local dive boats and private boats and before NSRI sea rescue craft and air resources were launched, the three divers were found safe ashore at Umgababa after they had managed to swim to shore and no one was injured and no further assistance was required. It appears that the three divers had surfaced away from their dive boat at the same time that visibility was reduced by weather conditions and the three divers, an experienced local dive charter lead diver and a French couple, had waited at their surfacing position for about 40 minutes; but after not regaining sight of their dive boat and not knowing what had become of their dive boat and skipper they had then initiated a swim towards shore and on reaching the shoreline they were found safe. The local dive companies, their dive boats, and 4 4 vehicles engaged in the search are commended for their efforts, Ireland said.African News Agency

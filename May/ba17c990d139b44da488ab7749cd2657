DURBAN - South Africa can regain its investment-grade rating without compromising on promises to transform the economy for the benefit of its black majority, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said on Wednesday.Africa's most industrialised economy suffered two credit ratings downgrades to "junk" last month after President Jacob Zuma sacked respected Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan."Even with the issues that the ratings agencies are raising with us we think that we can regain our investment grade," Gigaba told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum for Africa in Durban.Since his appointment as Gordhan's successor, Gigaba has vowed to "radically" transform the economy for the benefit of the black majority, which remains economically marginalised more than two decades after the end of apartheid.His comments have raised concerns with investors and ratings agencies, who fear the government may shift away from the fiscal consolidation outlined in the February budget."The political and economic elites cannot engage in banal debates about what name we must give the economic transformation that we seek," Gigaba said.#WEFAfrica2017 Gigaba answers question around downgrades and managing fiscal debt with responsible spending. #DStv403 pic.twitter.com/lXpd52rvKq#WEFAfrica2017 Gigaba on the ANC being conservative on economic transformation.

You cannot have an either-or question. It's a luxury we can't afford," Gigaba said.S&P Global Ratings cut South African foreign debt to sub-investment grade in April, while Fitch downgraded both the foreign and local currency debt to "junk" status.Moody's, two notches above junk status, has put South Africa on review for a downgrade.Gigaba, who recently met Moody's, said the agency was concerned about government plans to grow the economy, polices such as the procurement of nuclear power, and whether there was sufficient fiscal discipline to manage the budget."Those are the three vital, vital issues," he said.Reuters

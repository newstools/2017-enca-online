JOHANNESBURG - Stellenbosch University on Wednesday condemned Nazi-inspired posters advertising a "Anglo-Afrikaner" meeting and said three students were being questioned over the furore.The posters -- which copy Nazi propaganda images -- sparked immediate complaints when they appeared on noticeboards at the university.Dumb racists at Stellenbosch University in #SouthAfrica thought copying Nazi posters was a good idea https://t.co/Bmrrv672RZ pic.twitter.com/QdNlF3Lhh9"The posters and advertised event promoting racial polarisation (and) superiority combined with highly offensive references to Nazi propaganda and Neo-Nazism are totally unacceptable," the university said."We cannot condone views, events, publicity campaigns or innuendo that undermine our innate equality as human beings."The images showed a blonde woman and man in poses copied from German Nazi posters.Stellenbosch University was viewed as the intellectual home of Afrikaners during white-minority apartheid rule.In recent years, students have protested against continuing alleged racism at the university.Some students have campaigned for a ban on teaching in Afrikaans, saying it was the language of apartheid oppression.Meanwhile, AfriForum Youth said in a statement it condemns the depictions of the posters. Because the motive is still unknown, there can only be speculated over who is responsible for the posters, but the affixing of any ideological Nazi nostalgia is strongly condemned by AfriForum Youth. We believe the incident must be investigated, says Bernard Pieters, AfriForum Youth s Coordinator for Maties and the Eastern and Western Cape.AFP

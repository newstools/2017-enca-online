Amsterdam's mayor Eberhard van der Laan had already announced emergency measures Monday, before the Manchester suicide bombing at a concert by US pop star Ariana Grande."Chances are, judging by experience over the last few years, that a huge number of Ajax fans will gather in the city," Van der Laan said in a letter announcing the measures."There is a chance that public order will be disturbed and that cans, glasses and bottles will be thrown, vandalism will happen... and fireworks set off," the mayor said, before declaring parts of Amsterdam emergency zones.Many fans travelling to the city to watch the game on the giant screen in the shadow of the famous Rijksmuseum said they believed celebrations would be muted out of respect for the Manchester victims, some of them children.AFP

This is what Robert Sobukwe was saying in the 60 s if Africa is going to prosper in the continent we have to take control, we have to dismantle colonial control, we dismantle foreign invasion in our economy .and today African Union is talking about the things Sobukwe raised a long time ago, Pascall Taruvinga, Chief Heritage Officer for Robben Island.The party said the fight for freedom is still ongoing. We are going to fight for freedom, free black people, how will we know they are free? Because there will be no more shacks, there will be jobs and how will we see they are free by seeing African children attending school not having to worry about paying fees, said PAC veteran, Kwedi Mkhaliphi.The PAC and Robben Island Museum are working on further programmes to educate South Africans on Sobukwe s history.eNCA

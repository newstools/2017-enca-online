JOHANNESBURG The ANC must manage discontent and succession battles within the party or it risks tearing the 105-year-old liberation movement apart from within.This is what ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize told eNCA in an exclusive interview.He says the party is repeating the mistakes it made during the fall of Thabo Mbeki a decade ago.Mkhize believes the Workers' Day chaos that unfolded in Bloemfontein mimics the internal battles that played out towards the end of Mbeki s tenure as party leader.READ: What's at stake in the ANC 'succession' race I can say because I was part of that whole scene that it s, of course, important for leadership to manage a lot of these issues early. Because I can recall I was among those who were very angry. We still can t say that we justify it. And if it happened many years ago it was wrong. If it happened two weeks ago it was wrong. If it happened today it is wrong. Mkhize believes that relations within the tripartite alliance can be salvaged.And the mere thought of Cosatu, the SACP and the ANC going their separate ways is too terrible to contemplate. Even worse so if we were to consider the communist party registering as a political party and going it alone. That for me is going to more disastrous than other splits that the ANC has seen put together. It is going to be much more devastating. The ANC succession race is expected to begin officially at the party s policy conference next month.Click on the video above to watch the full interview.eNCA

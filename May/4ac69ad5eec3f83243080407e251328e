"I was pretty happy with the afternoon, I thought I was a bit wild through the morning, touching barriers and stuff like that, but we still have some work to do."It s more fun going faster here this year. It s only Thursday so it would be nice to do it again on Saturday (qualifying)."I was very happy with the first run this morning. Then we improved the car for the afternoon and the conditions improved too. You don t get many clear laps here due to traffic but both myself and Kimi (team-mate Raikkonen) seem quite happy with how we re looking."READ: Vettel relishing breaking Mercedes stronghold in RussiaAsked about Mercedes' apparently disappointing performance, Vettel added: "I don t know what happened to them today."It was a bit weird.

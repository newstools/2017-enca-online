MADRID - Real Madrid can only throw away a first La Liga title in five years on Sunday with a shock defeat at Malaga as they look set to depose rivals Barcelona's run as Spanish champions.Barca have won La Liga for six of the past eight years, but have to beat Eibar at home to have any chance of a third straight title in outgoing coach Luis Enrique's farewell to the Camp Nou.-- IT'S MATCHDAY!

We have planned for the same work rate and intensity. The players don't know any other way."Barca should at least force Real to get the point they need and give Enrique a victorious farewell when an Eibar side that have run out of steam after a great season visit the Camp Nou."I am concentrated on getting the three points," insisted Enrique."If our luck is in then fantastic, if not then we have to congratulate our rivals."Enrique has won eight trophies in three largely successful seasons in charge and will have the chance to add a ninth in next weekend's Copa del Rey final even if Madrid avoid defeat on Sunday.READ: Messi, Ronaldo kissing graffiti causes stir"Barca's history is full of moments like this. People come and go," added Enrique."I am very proud to have formed part of that history. I am a privileged one and next season I will be at the Camp Nou for many games as a fan."It is not a goodbye, but a see you later."AFP

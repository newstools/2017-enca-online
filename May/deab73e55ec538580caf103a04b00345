LOS ANGELES - Actors come and go, radio presenters live or die by their ratings and musicians top the charts only to be dropped, hostages to the vagaries of fickle public opinion.But some stars are destined to be remembered forever, their successes immortalised in terrazzo and brass on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a draw for visitors from across the world that has more staying power than any individual celebrity.Launched in 1958, the walk has built up more than 2,600 stars, each a tribute to the contribution of a public figure in the fields of film, television, recording, radio or, latterly, live theatre."The criteria for getting a star are longevity in the field of entertainment -- of five years or more -- awards nominations, and very important to us is that they do philanthropic work," said Ana Martinez, who arranges the ceremonies. #OTD in 2008, rap mogul Sean Diddy Combs received a star on Hollywood s Walk of Fame.

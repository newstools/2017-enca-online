PRETORIA Mamelodi Sundowns hopes of defending their league title came to an end in the penultimate game of the season after they were held to a 2-2 by Maritzburg United at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday night.With Bidvest Wits beating Polokwane City 2-0 in Johannesburg, the Pretoria club had to win to take the race to the final day of the season. But going into the final five minutes 0-2 down, two late goals from Yannick Zakri were not enough to rescue the Brazilians.Sundowns made a promising start, but with the home side failing to get any clear chances in on goal, Maritzburg grew increasingly confident as the half progressed.And with the atmosphere growing more tense by the minute, the Team of Choice shocked the Sundowns supporters into silence when Brian Onyango stormed into the box to head in Deolin Mekoa s 30th-minute corner.Having spoken about his team s weakness at defending set-pieces ahead of the match, Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was unsurprisingly left fuming in the dug-out.The African Champions pushed and probed for openings, but found chances hard to come by against a confident and determined Maritzburg defence.With the exception of an excellent save to keep out a Teko Modise header, Maritzburg keeper Virgil Vries had barely been tested by the time a somewhat anxious Masandawana side went into the half-time break at a near-capacity Attridgeville.Vries did, however, to do very well just after the break to intercept the ball with his knee outside of his box as Khama Billiat went flying in on goal.But again Maritzburg remained calm and they doubled their advantage in the 67th minute through a breathtaking individual effort that saw Evans Rusike sprinting half the pitch and holding off several challenges before chipping the ball over Downs keeper Kennedy Mweene.After Zakri had nodded wide at the back post for Downs, Hlompho Kekana looked set to halve the deficit eight minutes from time with a brilliant curler, but Vries made an even better save.Finally, the hosts got on the score-sheet when Zakri pulled one back with a neat finish in the box two minutes from time.A Vries blunder then allowed Zakri to poke home deep in extra time, but the final whistle blew soon after as the defending Absa Premiership champions reign came to an end.

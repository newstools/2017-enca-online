"We thought we had it under control early on and then it kicked off. I was under pressure a little but the team came through for me."It's a pretty special day really -- very, very special."Admitting, "I was pretty relieved when I went under the 3km (to go) banner," Bennett said he hopes his first major stage race crown can launch him to greater feats."It's a major stepping stone for me. I can take a lot from this, confidence and with the team," Bennett said. "I want to keep building on this in Europe." Exciting to sit in on the final press conference.

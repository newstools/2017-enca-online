Successful deployment of Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit confirmed. SpaceX, which is headed by Elon Musk, did not attempt to bring the first stage of the rocket back to Earth for an upright landing following the launch.The payload weighed some 13,500 pounds (6,100 kilograms), and the force needed to propel it to orbit would not leave enough fuel for the rocket to manoeuvre back to Earth.AFP

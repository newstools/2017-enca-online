Ke, who has some 3.5 million followers on Twitter-like service Weibo, shared details of the Google event and his trip to Wuzhen, which is also the seat of the country's top annual government internet conference."Ke Jie pushed AlphaGo right to the limit," tweeted DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis following the match.

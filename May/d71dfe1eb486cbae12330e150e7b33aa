JOHANNESBURG - DA leader Mmusi Maimane has vowed to return to Zambia to express his support for jailed opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema.Maimane flew to Lusaka to express his solidarity with jailed opposition leader, Hakainde Hichilema, but was barred from entering the country on Thursday.The Zambian government said it warned Maimane to postpone visiting the country until Hichilema's trial was over.Hichilema's supporters have accused President Edgar Lungu of turning the country into a dictatorship.Zambian authorities said Maimane was denied entry to the country for disrespecting its judiciary. They believe his presence in the country will undermine the judiciary's integrity.Zambia's High Commissioner Emmanuel Mwamba said, The point to emphasise for us is that his remarks were contemptuous to the court process. They were grave to the standing of the court in Zambia. It s imperative that if he wishes to go and observe the process he can still go without insulting our judiciary."Government was especially concerned with Mr Maimane's and the DA's media statement prior to his visit to Zambia that stated that his party would pressure our courts of law in Zambia to release Zambia's opposition leader Mr Hakainde Hichilema."You're aware that Mr Hichilema is currently undergoing a treason trial, and Zambia holds that Mr Hichilema is legitimately before that court. He's legally before that court. He's properly before that court."The DA protested against the decision outside the Zambian High Commission in Pretoria on Friday. eNCA

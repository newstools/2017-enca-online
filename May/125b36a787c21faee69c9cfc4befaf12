It's too late now, that alliance is dead from 1996 and it's been in the ICU in a coma, it's time to pull the plug on it now."Naidoo says the federation should never have expelled the National Union of Metal Workers."Thirty five people in the central committee expelled three hundred and fifty thousand people. I can tell you with absolute certainty we would have never done that in that Cosatu leadership expelling three hundred and fifty thousand people because you have a political disagreement with them."Naidoo also took aim at Cosatu affiliate Sadtu for failing the education system. This is a union that does not take action against teachers guilty of abusing young girls, of selling posts of principals, it s unacceptable."Naidoo says calls for a new leadership are growing louder - but dirty money stands in the way."We have thousands of leaders. They're just not in the right place and the system of getting them to the top is so controlled by people who carry bags of cash that buy off people that we only get bad leaders at the top."Naidoo appealed to South Africans to learn a lesson from the Fees Must Fall movement by uniting and strengthening community activism. eNCA

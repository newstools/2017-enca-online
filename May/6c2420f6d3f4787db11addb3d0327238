Now I am not so sure," a person close to the situation told the Financial Times.Steel magnate Usmanov already had a previous bid for Arsenal rejected and has been critical of Kroenke's passive ownership style in the past.Usmanov's latest offer comes at a tricky time for the north London club, who are in severe danger of missing out on a lucrative place in next season's Champions League following a miserable Premier League campaign marred by calls for boss Arsene Wenger to quit.Wenger is yet to reveal if he will extend his 21-year reign and failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in two decades would cost Arsenal an estimated 50 million in revenue.AFP

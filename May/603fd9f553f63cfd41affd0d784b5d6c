WASHINGTON - Social sharing platform Snapchat has today debuted a nifty group sharing mechanic to its Stories feature."Today we re announcing a new way to create custom Stories about anything, with any of your friends, even for a specific location! It's perfect for a trip, a birthday party, or a new baby story just for the family," it writes on its blog. snapchat stories r fun bc u see everything u weren t invited to pic.twitter.com/7LKaFswWW2Heading to a gig with friends? Going to the big game on the weekend with chums? Or heading to your local canyon for some paddling with your besties? Snapchat now lets users create custom stories to capture the moment with other individuals.The new feature doesn't really change the interface much either.Users can add a new Story by tapping the Stories circles icon in the bottom right of the app, selecting the "Create Story" button in the top right, and giving it a name. Users can then invite other to participate in building the story.Read: Snapchat introduces snapping spectacles"Stories disappear if no one has contributed to them in the past 24 hours," the company adds.While this might not solve the company's immediate problems (Instagram's encroaching threat and Snap's dismal financial performance), it might just encourage those who don't regularly use Snapchat to engage with the app more often.Bolstering its 160-million user base is all Snapchat can really aim to do at present.Memeburn

This has resulted in firm closures and concomitant job losses. According to Seifsa the sector lost 25 000 jobs in the last year representing the closure of almost 500 small to medium companies. This was a loss of more than 6% of the total 400 000 workers employed in the sector.The note identified structural factors such as a lack of fixed investment in modern plant and equipment and underinvestment in skills and research and development as contributing to the industry s decline. The current cyclical downturn characterised by weak export demand and stiff import competition in a domestic environment of rising costs has only served to accelerate the sector s challenges. iNet Bridge

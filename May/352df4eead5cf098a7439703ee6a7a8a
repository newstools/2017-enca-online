PARLIAMENT - Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba insisted on Tuesday that radical economic transformation was inevitable, but said this would not entail nationalisation of banks or mines.Gigaba told Parliament s standing committee on finance that whether one termed the change he referred to as radical economic transformation or inclusive growth, it was needed to address the plight of the poor.WATCH: FinMin Gigaba gives maiden Parly reportHe said the aim was to give everyone a chance to participate in the economy. The fact of the matter is that you want to address the plight of these people and the plight of the people doesn t confine itself to unemployment, it includes their desire to have land assets, to have access to the financial sector, ... and so whatever decisions we take are in line with the National Development Plan, he said. And so there is no other view, absolutely none, no view to take up arms, to nationalise the banks, to nationalise the Reserve Bank, to nationalise the mines in terms of government, no such views exist, so I do not think anybody has to worry. Gigaba brushed aside concerns that his utterances, and those of his controversial advisor, Chris Malikane, meant a turning away from the firm commitment to the financial consolidation of his predecessor, Pravin Gordhan, who was fired at the end of March in a sweeping Cabinet reshuffle.READ: The odd meaning of radical economic transformationHe said he believed he had been entirely consistent since taking up the post, and added that ministers were free to ignore views expressed by their advisors if they did not agree with these. So the minister is not schizophrenic, he said.African News Agency

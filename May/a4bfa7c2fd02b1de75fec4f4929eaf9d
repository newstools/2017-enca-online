They pair were arrested on Wednesday last week.But this week the farmers approached the North West High Court, on an urgent basis, to request an early bail application date and also to move their case from Coligny to Lichtenburg.Judge Nadia Gutta granted the accused an early bail application date but, refused to move their court to Lichtenburg.Opposing bail, Brigadier Clifford Kgorane testified on Tuesday, that charges of kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice would be added to their charge sheet.He accused the pair of removing the bakkie from the crime scene. The police officer also said they threatened a witness with a firearm before taking his cellphone.Brigadier Kgorane told the court the pair was safer in custody, as their released on bail would trigger public unrest in Coligny and would also put their lives at risk.However, the accused said prior to their arrests the community was aware they had been linked to the incident, but there had been no threats.Pieter Karsten, Doorewaard s uncle, who employs the two accused, told the court that residents of Coligny wanted them released and charges against them withdrawn. About 150 people signed the petition to that effect.Asked by prosecutor Nkhetheni Mudau, why only white residents signed the petition and not a single black person signed, Karsten cited time constraints.Magistrate Makgaola Foso is presiding over the matter after Magistrate Mattheus van Loggenberg recused himself from the case on 28 April, for safety reasons.African News Agency

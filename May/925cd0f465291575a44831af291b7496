She made another at the par-5 15th but bogeys at 16 and 18 sandwiched around a birdie at 17 kept her off the pace.Ko, trying to fight off rivals and remain atop the rankings, fired a bogey-free 67, opening with a birdie on the par-4 10th, adding back-to-back birdies at the par-5 third and par-4 fourth and another at the par-5 seventh."Playing well. Was good to get confidence going into the weekend," Ko said. "It was a pretty steady round. The front nine I gave myself a lot of looks for birdies and a lot of them really slipped by. But I feel like I'm putting good strokes on it. That's all I can do at the end of the day."South Korea's Chun In-Gee and American Vicky Hurst shared fifth on 135 with China's Feng Shanshan and Americans Angela Stanford and Brittany Lincicome on 136.AFP

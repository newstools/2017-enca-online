LONDON - Britain's sports minister welcomed changes to the set-up of England's Football Association which risked losing millions of pounds of public money if it did not alter its structure.Several changes were agreed at the annual general meeting of English football's governing body at Wembley on Thursday after FA chairman Greg Clarke had pressed for reform. The main alterations have seen the FA's board reduced from 12 members to 10, with three seats reserved for women from 2018, and the introduction of term limits."I'm absolutely delighted the FA has understood the importance of good governance and implemented these reforms," sports minister Tracey Crouch told Britain's Press Association."And I pay tribute to Greg Clarke for making it clear that the FA is committed to complying with the new governance code."From November, any organisation wanting public money from funding agency Sport England or the elite UK Sport must comply with Crouch's governance code.Had the FA failed to reform, it stood to lose some 15 million in public money.Former Leicester City and English Football League chairman Clarke vowed to quit the FA if a reform package failed to go through, with doubts about the organisation's ability to charge summed up when the House of Commons passed a "no confidence" vote in the FA's ability to reform itself in February.Clarke said Thursday in an FA statement: "This is a significant moment and a very positive step. "Good corporate governance is essential for any successful organisation and these new reforms have the interests of football at their core. They will benefit all of English football."AFP

LONDON - Alexis Sanchez kept alive Arsenal's fading hopes of qualifying for the Champions League as the Chilean broke Sunderland's stubborn resistance to seal a crucial 2-0 win on Tuesday. Alexis Sanchez scores his and Arsenal's second goal of the night. #afc pic.twitter.com/ql1Wk6Exj5Arsene Wenger's side was struggling to see off relegated Sunderland until Sanchez came to the rescue with two goals deep into the second half at the Emirates Stadium.Despite refusing to sign a new contract, Sanchez remains the only Arsenal player consistently performing at a world-class standard and the former Barcelona forward, playing despite a recent thigh injury, is the sole reason they still have a faint chance of a top-four finish. Alexis Sanchez involved in 43 goals from 48 games this season.

Games: 37 Goals: 23 Assists: 10 Nobody has been involved in more Premier League goals than Alexis Sanchez this season...-- pic.twitter.com/XwI1fLth1NOlivier Giroud was the culprit after flicking the ball goalwards with his arm, and the Arsenal striker wasted a chance to redeem himself moments later when his close-range effort was pushed away by Pickford.Wenger moaned this week that Arsenal's top-four rivals were benefiting from playing teams with their minds already on their holidays, ignoring the fact the Gunners enjoyed victories over a Manchester United side more concerned with the Europa League final and a Stoke team with nothing to play for.Sunderland, losers in nine of their last 12 games and relegated last month, were hardly a step up in class.Lead balloonYet Arsenal didn't find it easy to kill them off.A sharp stop from Pickford prevented Aaron Ramsey converting Mesut Ozil's pass, while Hector Bellerin curled just over before Granit Xhaka's strike skidded wide.Never totally convincing at the back, Arsenal were almost breached against the run of play when Didier N'Dong tested Petr Cech, who then had to save from Jermain Defoe.That sparked another flurry of Arsenal pressure, but both Bellerin and Ramsey shot into the side-netting, while Rob Holding headed straight at Pickford.News of City's goals against West Brom went down like a lead balloon at half-time and Nacho Monreal almost deepened Arsenal's gloom with a comically miscued backpass that had Cech scrambling to keep it out.That foreshadowed a nervous period for Arsenal, who looked short of ideas in the final third, and after Giroud glanced a header wide, Wenger sent on Danny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi.When the breakthrough finally arrived in the 72nd minute, inevitably it was Sanchez who saved the day, tapping in from virtually on the line after Ozil's pass had unhinged the Sunderland defender.Sanchez wasn't finished yet and he doubled Arsenal's lead with a close-range header from Giroud's flick eight minutes later.Whether it will be enough to save Arsenal's dispiriting season remains to be seen.AFP

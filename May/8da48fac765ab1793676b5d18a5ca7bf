CAPE TOWN - The Stormers ended a tour from hell with a third defeat in as many weeks on Friday in New Zealand where the Hurricanes ran in a seven-try 41-22 victory at the Westpac Stadium, in Wellington, after leading 22-16 at halftime.The Super Rugby champions ran in four tries in the opening half and then three more in the second for a bonus-point win. It was their 11th consecutive win on home soil. Had Jordie Barrett had his kicking boots on, the score might well have passed the 50-point mark but he failed with four conversion attempts in the match.READ: Stormers where has it gone right?The Stormers will return to Cape Town on Saturday without a single log point after suffering 57-14 (Highlanders) and 57-24 (Crusaders) defeats in their other two tour matches.The Stormers started off well enough, much like previous weeks in New Zealand where they suffered heavy defeats after their defence capitulated as the games wore on.The Hurricanes were forced to defend in the opening minutes as the Stormers enjoyed a few sorties into the opposition 22m territory but again they came away tryless.Your Canes secure an entertaining win on #ClubNight at #OurHouse @westpacstadiumnz -- -- @GettySport pic.twitter.com/MjkrVBCPnaStormers flyhalf Robert du Preez opened the scoring in the match with a fourth-minute penalty (3-0).Once the Hurricanes wrested the initiative, they set off on a wave of attacks which produced three unanswered tries, one of which was converted by their fullback Jordie Barrett.

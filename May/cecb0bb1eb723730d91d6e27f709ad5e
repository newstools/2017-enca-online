CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town had been left with 12,3 percent of usable dam water despite recent rains meaning the situation remains critical.The City called on residents to maintain water saving efforts.In a statement, the City said, "dam levels are now at 22,8 percent (storage levels), which is 0,6 percent down from a week ago. With the last 10 percent of a dam s water mostly not being useable, dam levels are effectively at 12,3 percent. The latest consumption is 680 million litres, which is 80 million litres over the new consumption target of 600 million litres."READ: #Drought: Five reasons why we aren't winning We thank the many residents who are still active water ambassadors. We do, however, need to become more consistent as our consumption remains too high considering the unexpected hot weather which continues and irrespective of the bit of rain that we have had."Our water users also continue to respond to the unpredictable climatic conditions by using more water as soon as it heats up, but seemingly also when there is rain."This approach is exacerbating the effects of the enduring and severe drought. Such phenomena are expected to become more frequent as a result of the impact of climate change."In addition, the severity and scale of drought episodes are increasingly difficult to predict. Our relationship with water, therefore, must start to change this relationship is something that we can control.Our water-saving efforts cannot be influenced by whether it is hot or cold. We need to save water irrespective of the weather, said the City s Mayoral Committee Member for Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services; and Energy, Councillor Xanthea Limberg.The City is busy finalising proposals for further intensified water restrictions, subject to due process. In the meantime, the City continues its plea that residents stop using municipal water for all outside use, including for watering the garden and filling up pools even on the currently allowed watering days.The City is also continuing with pressure reduction programmes to reduce the flow of water at a time, as well as water losses through leakage in the pipework of the distribution system. The regulation of supply is under way in the central, southern and eastern suburbs and within the next week it will be expanded to the northern suburbs.The City warned that consumers should not be alarmed if they experience very low pressure or if the supply in their area drops away as it will only be temporary until the balance is achieved.Residents can contact the City via email to water@capetown.gov.za for queries or report contraventions of the water restrictions (evidence should be provided to assist the City s enforcement efforts) or they can send an SMS to 31373.For further information, residents should please visit the water restrictions page on the City s website: www.capetown.gov.za/thinkwatereNCA

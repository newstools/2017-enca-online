POLOKWANE The Limpopo Department of Health confirmed on Friday that there have been deaths in the province due to an outbreak of malaria.Earlier in the week, it was reported that more than 600 cases of malaria infections had been documented in Limpopo so far this year.Malaria transmission is continuing, mainly in the Mopani and Vhembe districts.The provincial health department said the epidemic was under control and it would release a definitive report on the number of malaria-related deaths possibly next week. The cases of malaria are rapidly going and the situation is currently highly under control, said Limpopo health department spokesperson Thabiso Teffo. Fatalities are currently a percentage of the entire infections, not necessarily the numbers per say."The malaria situation is not a new thing in this country [but] unlike in Cuba, where they have totally eradicated malaria."We would have expected many people to pass on but fortunately there was early detection where we had a huge number of people coming to our facilities. That in itself has helped in terms of reduction of a number of people who have passed on."But one death is one too many," he said.READ: First large-scale malaria vaccine trials for AfricaThe National Institute for Communicable Diseases said there were a number of reasons for the increase in malaria transmission in recent weeks.A combination of increased rainfall and temperatures and reduced insecticide spray coverage in some areas had probably contributed.The incoming winter season will provide relief as the malaria-bearing mosquitos cannot breed during the winter period.Hospitals and clinics in the area are receiving supplies of Coartem for oral treatment after there had been a shortage. Both public and private sector [hospitals] had that particular challenge in this country, which is supplied by one international company, but we have been able to get stock.

We understand that we are a province that shares borders with these particular countries, said Teffo. So the situation that side effects us. eNCA

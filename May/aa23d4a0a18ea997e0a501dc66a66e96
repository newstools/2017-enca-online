PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, US - A robot resembling a small mechanical ostrich demonstrates sophisticated two-legged locomotion, according to the researchers that built it.Known as the Planar Elliptical Runner, it doesn't use sensors or computers on board to keep itself upright, instead its mechanical design provides stability and balance as it runs.READ: Millions of jobs on the line, intelligent robots set to take overThe team from the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), based in Pensacola, Florida, say it's the first segmented leg, bi-pedal running robot that balances by itself. When the leg feels resistance it puts more power in to match that resistance and to overcome it, the developers say, thus keeping it upright.Just one motor drives the legs, with a radio controller determining how much power is applied to the motor. For lab-based tests on a treadmill, the robot is sandwiched between two glass plates, meaning it can't turn, but can tip forwards or backwards and fall down.When tested on a treadmill, the robot hit speeds of about 12 miles per hour (mph) before it failed.The scientists are now exploring how to extend the concept to 3D running; without the glass barriers either side.Such 'dynamic geometry', they say, could help inform future bi-pedal robot design to make them more efficient.Robots that are agile and robust enough to traverse difficult terrain could eventually be used in situations where it's too dangerous to send a human, such as search and rescue missions.Reuters

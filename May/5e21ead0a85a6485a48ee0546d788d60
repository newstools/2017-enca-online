TAIPEI - With moss-covered seats and an explosion of lush plants and flowers throughout its interior, the "forest bus" offers a fragrant leafy ride for passengers used to crammed public transport in Taiwan's capital.The ordinary single-deck city bus has been converted into a travelling greenhouse decorated with orchids, ginger lilies and a variety of ferns is running on a special route through Taipei, with stops including an art museum, a popular temple and a night market.Florist Alfie Lin, who created the temporary installation, said he wanted to bring a touch of nature to commuters' busy routines."I hope the public will feel that it's a beautiful and interesting experience," he told AFP."They can smell the scent of summer on the bus and see the vibrant green plants to feel messages from nature."READ: Cameroon reforestation efforts still a losing battleReactions have been enthusiastic, with passengers queueing to board and expressing hopes that it will become a permanent attraction in Taipei.For now the toll-free bus is running on a week-long trial, ending Sunday, and takes around 20 passengers."I feel happy and relaxed on the bus smelling the flowers and plants. I hope it can become a regular service on a double-decker. It would become something special to Taipei," said housewife Celine Wei.Museum employee Larry Huang is also a big fan of the bus and has been on it three days in a row."There is no rushing on and off like a regular bus. We chat and take photos for each other. I feel like I'm at a party with friends," he said.AFP

JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters says in light of the leaked emails that were revealed on Sunday, there was no reason for people who have been protecting President Jacob Zuma to continue doing so.The National Chairperson of the EFF, Dali Mpofu says the latest email scandal, shows how problematic the ANC s protection of Zuma is. It is the people themselves who will see that the problem is just not President Jacob Zuma but the ANC itself is hell-bent on protecting him when it is clear that he is involved in criminality, Mpofu said.READ: Leaked emails implicate Guptas in claims of state captureTwo Sunday newspapers reported on a series of damning emails, which detail the Gupta family s alleged influence over Zuma.Both the Sunday Times and City Press report that the controversial family is at the heart of a scheme to provide the president with residence in the United Arab Emirates.Zuma has rubbished the claim. This is proof of what the SA council of churches just said last week, that this is a mafia state. So if you don t want to believe us as the opposition then at least believe the SACC, Mpofu said.A tweet by EFF president Julius Malema from last year was circulated on Sunday morning. In the post, Malema claimed Zuma was planning to flee South Africa. We received unconfirmed reports that Zuma wants to leave the country and seek asylum in Dubai because he doesn't feel safe in his country!Watch Mpofu s full interview in the gallery above.eNCA

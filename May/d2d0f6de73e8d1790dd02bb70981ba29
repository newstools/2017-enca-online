CAPE TOWN Cape Town City recovered from their defeat to Maritzburg United earlier this week with a 1-0 home win over Free State Stars on Friday night.The Citizens moved to within two points of league leaders Bidvest Wits, who host Maritzburg on Sunday. 3 hard points in the bag on to the next one boys---------- @CapeTownCityFC @ctcfc_ultras pic.twitter.com/9RQb5zSdHL City were not at their best against Ea Lla Koto and were slightly edgy at times, but on the balance of play, they deserved the three points.The home team had the first chances of the game as Lebogang Manyama sent a 30-yard shot marginally wide in the sixth minute before Letsie Koapeng turned well in the box but had his effort well saved by Thela Ngobeni.Although Stars were mainly on the back foot they did have two chances in quick succession around the 20-minute mark, but Makhehlene Makhaula shot straight at Shu-aib Walters after a slick move while Thabo Maphakisa fired wide of the target from a good position inside the box two minutes later.It was then City s turn again as Aubrey Ngoma struck a shot from a tight angle, but Ngobeni was up to the task with a good save at the near post with his foot.That proved to be it for first half chances as both teams struggled to create openings in the final 15 minutes.READ: Wits beat Sundowns to go top of PremiershipWith the home side anxious to get the three points needed to stay in the title race, the opening quarter of the second half was cagey.But the mood was lightened considerably in the 62nd minute when Vincent Kobola s pin-point cross following a free-flowing move was expertly headed into the far corner of the net by Judas Moseamedi.Moseamedi turned provider two minutes later when he teed up Ngoma, who looked set to double the lead only for Ngobeni to go diving through the air to pull off a wonderful save.

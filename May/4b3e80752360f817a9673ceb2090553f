The two alleged they caught Mosweu stealing sunflowers at their employer’s field near the informal settlement. They say they put him on the back of a van and intended to hand him over to police, but he jumped out of the van 3km away from the town and suffered neck injuries. However, an eyewitness told the police Matlhomola was thrown out of the moving van. He died later on his way to hospital. The sixteen-year-old was buried on Sunday. The crowd that had been protesting in front of the court burst into war songs marching down Voortrekker Street, saying they were going to set alight a sunflower crop field near Tlhabologang. A house was torched following the bail hearing. It's not clear if the man who attacked photojournalist, Mujahid Safodien, was the owner of the house, or not. A police helicopter monitored the situation from the sky while a large police contingent maintained order in the central business district. The accused are expected back in court on June 26. -- Additional reporting: eNCA [WATCH] Photojournalist, Mujahid Safodien, provides some reaction after being attacked by a #Coligny farmer earlier today. #DStv 403 pic.twitter.com/XQwhdkOTrX  African News Agency

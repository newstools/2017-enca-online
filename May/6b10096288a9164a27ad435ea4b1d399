MELBOURNE The Lions clinched a ninth Super Rugby win of the season as they routed the Rebels 47-10 in Melbourne on Saturday.In the end, the Lions recorded seven tries as they completed a comfortable bonus-point win that maintains their ascendancy at the top of the Africa group.The Lions dominating territory and possession in the opening quarter, but as was the case last weekend, their finishing lacked its usual accuracy.As a result, the opening quarter remained scoreless as the Rebels abrasive defence stood up to the test of the Lions multi-phase ball movement.However, the Lions eventually found a way to breach the defence as Kwagga Smith twisted over the tryline in the 20th minute, while Ross Cronje showed good footwork to finish off another five-pointer soon after.

To make matters worse, Rebels replacement Culum Retallick was shown a yellow card.It was a seven-pointer that sealed the result, and from there, Anthony Volmink and Warren Whiteley went over for the Lions final two tries as they completed an important bonus-point win.Scorers: Rebels 10 (7): Try: Tom English.

JOHANNESBURG Xolisani Ndongeni, SA s reigning Boxer of the Year, will have his first outing next weekend when he tops a bill in Cape Town against Ghana s Razak Nettey (20-4).Six months on from his last fight, points win over Juan Mendez in California, Ndongeni (22-0) is looking to do a number on his opponent to remind everyone of his class as a fighter. Nomeva is rated by three of the major organisations, not least the WBA, which has him at number five, and cannot afford to slip up against a man he ought to have the beating of.Given that the lightweight has seen no more than a brief video clip of Nettey, Ndongeni isn t certain of what he ll be up against, which is why he s sparred against a variety of boxers in the HotBox gym.They include Frans Ramabolo, Warren Joubert, Tyrone Hall, Tshifiwa Munyai, Ricky Tshabalala and even light-heavyweight Ryno Liebenberg. They ve all offered different challenges. Training has been going great, said the easy-going 27-year-old. I m growing up as a boxer every day and I m grateful where I am. Where he s at is in the mix among the elite of the division, although he ll need a major scalp or belt to fortify his position.Given promoter Rodney Berman s tie-in with US counterpart Art Pelullo, there s every chance Ndongeni will land a title shot or major fight before long. It s what he craves.If, and when, it happens, he ll have his passport by his side. Last time he was US-bound he misplaced his visa, scuppering his trip. He s since replaced it and is keeping it safe, patiently waiting for the phone to ring.For now, Cape Town beckons. Nomeva s legion of fans will doubtless cheer his return.The event will take place at Coetzenberg Sports Centre, on 28 May, at 13h00.African News Agency

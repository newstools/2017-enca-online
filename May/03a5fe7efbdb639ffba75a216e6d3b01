CAPE TOWN The Crazy Store, South Africa s biggest discount variety chain, will open an outlet in neighbouring Botswana on Friday.The company said on Thursday its first Botswana outlet would open in the Mowana Park Shopping Centre in the upmarket Gaborone suburb of Phakalane.Kevin Lennett, managing director, said Botswana was the obvious next step and the choice of location, in a shopping hub, made perfect sense because the Crazy Store is all about convenience . Botswana is known as a country that offers international retailers with diverse options for retail expansion due to their strong economic growth and a stable middle class, Lennett said. The most common retail sectors are clothing, accessories, food and drink, home and kitchen and, of course, at the Crazy Store, we can offer many of those sectors under one roof. The South African retail chain, which launched in 1995, offers goods in 18 core categories, from toys to cleaning products to hardware, personal care and even fashion.African News Agency

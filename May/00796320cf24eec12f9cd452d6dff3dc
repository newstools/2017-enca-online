PRETORIA - The North Gauteng High Court has struck Berning Ntlemeza's urgent interdict against Police Minister Fikile Mbalula from the roll, with costs.The former Hawks boss wanted the court to bar Mbalula from blocking his return to work.Judge Shiela Mphahlele on Thursday found that there is no urgency in Ntlemeza's application and that the matter of his appointment is set to be heard by the Supreme Court of Appeal on June 2.The defence argued that Ntlemeza was prejudiced and humiliated every day he was not allowed to return to duty.The judge said that Ntlemeza is still earning a salary and no prejudice against him had been proven.She reiterated two previous court findings that his appointment was irrational and unlawful.Judge Mphahlele also said it would be against the interest of law and against the interest of justice for Ntlemeza to return to work.READ: Ntlemeza asks court to overturn Mbalula s 'illegal conduct'Ntlemeza was dismissed following the court ruling that declared his appointment irrational and invalid.Tweets about #BerningNtlemeza AND (FROM:@karynmaughan since:2017-05-18 until:2017-05-19) eNCA

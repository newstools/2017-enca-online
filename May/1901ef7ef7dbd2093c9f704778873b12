WELLINGTON After initially being committed on defence, the Cheetahs eventually reverted to their old habits as they let in nine tries in a 61-7 thrashing at the hands of the Hurricanes in Wellington on Saturday. Your Canes secure their 12th consecutive win at #OurHouse @WestpacStadium -- -- @GettySport pic.twitter.com/2HKFfDvMof The defending Super Rugby champions found it difficult to breach the Bloemfontein side s lines in the first half, as Franco Smith s men showed greater application to stick to the system and make their one-on-one tackles.It was expected that the floodgates would open, but the Canes took all of 17 minutes to open the scoring and it came from a comedy of errors from the visitors.Cheetahs scrumhalf Shaun Venter took an ill-advised quick 22-metre drop-out that was blocked by opposite number TJ Perenara, and it was followed by wing Raymond Rhule trying to run the ball out. But his pass was blocked flank Vaea Fifita, who regained possession to go over.READ: Hurricanes run in seven tries for a 41-22 win over StormersWhen the powerhouse centre Vince Aso handed-off Sergeal Petersen a few minutes later to grab the first try of a hat-trick, it looked like the Cheetahs resistance had crumbled.But to their credit, their forwards brought them back into the game, with the likes of Uzair Cassiem and Elandr Huggett prominent.The pressure eventually turned into points as flyhalf Fred Zeilinga showed some good footwork to beat Ngani Laumape to score the Cheetahs only try.But that was the last time that they troubled the scorers as the Hurricanes hit back just before the break, with flank Ardie Savea forcing his way over for a 21-7 lead.A three-try blitz in 11 minutes after half-time ended the match as a contest, with TJ Perenara getting on to the scoreboard and Aso grabbing a second, with tighthead prop Jeff Toomaga-Allen crashing over as well. These two have 11 tries each in 2017. Will @NLaumape or @vinceaso4221 equal Tana Umaga's single season record first? #HURvsCHE --@GettySport pic.twitter.com/XWBk42RSF8 The best effort of the night brought up the hat-trick for Aso, as inside centre Laumape cut the line with searing pace from inside his own 22 and then chipped ahead for his midfield partner to catch and score.With five minutes to go, the Cheetahs nightmare was exemplified when they were unable to control their own five-metre lineout throw, with the ball squirting loose for Canes replacement hooker Leni Apisai to dive over and set a new record winning margin for the hosts against the Cheetahs.Scorers: Hurricanes 61 (21): Tries: Vaea Fifita, Vince Aso (3), Ardie Savea, TJ Perenara, Jeff Toomaga-Allen, Ben Lam, Leni Apisai. Conversions: Beauden Barrett (5), Otere Black (3). Cheetahs 7 (7): Tries: Fred Zeilinga. Conversions: Zeilinga (1).

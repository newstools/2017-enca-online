JOHANNESBURG - Thando Ntini, son of former Proteas bowler Makhaya Ntini, is already making a name for himself in the junior ranks in South African cricket.At 16-years-old and 1.9 metres tall, Ntini has already been taken under the wings by Western Province cricket.Makhaya Ntini's 16 year old son Thando Ntini has been included in SA U19 team for 5 ODI's vs WI U19 pic.twitter.com/kbrOkiiLqV Sure, he is Makhaya Ntini s son, says Cricket SA s head of Tertiary and Youth Cricket Niels Momberg, But what really strikes me, is his natural talent, he says. Thando hits good areas regularly and nips the ball around, thereby creating pressure, said Momberg. I think he can bowl at 135 km/h once he grows a bit stronger, he said.Western Province gave Ntini a trial run at a Colts one-day match in Durbanville recently and he impressed immensely.#NewProfilePic pic.twitter.com/xsQD7XE16pAt the Colts week in Potchefstroom, he bowled superbly and also put in some decent performances with the bat.Western Province Academy interim head coach Siya Sibiya said Ntini could have definite prospects as an allrounder. He is seen as a potential phenomenal opening bowler who can become South Africa s first true black all-rounder, said Sibiya.The next step is representing South Africa at Under-19 level in July against the West Indies in Pietermaritzburg and Durban. To a certain degree, he is already following in Makhaya s footsteps, because Makhaya represented the SA Under-19 team in 1995, Momberg said.READ: Ntini and Kallis SA s top individual performers in history of Champions Trophy One other thing I like about him, is his action. He has a very good action. He is a very focused young man and he wants to go the distance, without the aid of his father, said Sibiya.African News Agency

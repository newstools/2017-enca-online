CAPE TOWN - Tensions were high in Parliament on Tuesday as acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane went up against police watchdog head Robert McBride.The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) wants Phalane suspended.The police watchdog says the acting police commissioner has been interfering with its investigations and instructing witnesses not to co-operate.The IPID and SAPS briefed Parliament's Police Committee.Phahlane hit back, saying the IPID has been captured.The acting commissioner then went on to tell MPs that IPID was dysfunctional and its independence was non-existent. Without any fear of contradiction, IPID as an independent body doesn t exist is not functioning."Under the current circumstances it might be safe to call it OPID O Sullivan s Police Investigative Directorate, said Phahlane, suggesting there was a nefarious relationship between Paul O Sullivan and McBride. They [IPID] have been captured for far too long. We cannot allow IPID to be utilised to serve people s personal agendas. - Additional reporting ANAeNCA

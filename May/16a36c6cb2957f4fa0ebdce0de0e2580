All roads might lead to Rome, but many paths have crossed at Terroir, acclaimed chef Michael Broughton observes after lunch at the launch of his restaurant s new winter menu.True that I vaguely recall working briefly in the coffee shop that preceded Broughton s celebrated restaurant.How things have changed Broughton, a self-taught chef, moved from Joburg to open Terroir in 2004 at Kleine Zalze, won a string of awards and turned it into one of the Winelands most sought-after gourmet destinations.Unlike some of the bigger wine estates, Kleine Zalze doesn t have tourists arriving by the busload, so guests aren t forced to join the scrum for seats and wine tastings, which equates to more attention to detail and the personal touch. The tasting room s peaceful, so visitors can enjoy the experience at their leisure and not feel rushed to make a purchase.Living up its name, Terroir offers a sense of place under the mottled shade of the giant oak trees, you can breathe freely, take in the view and enjoy Broughton s deceptively simple seasonal cuisine at your leisure.Winter is always a treat for restaurant-goers in the Cape and Terroir s no slouch, with the release of its special winter menu, which is available until September.Guests are offered a choice of either two dishes (starter and mains or mains and dessert) from their French-inspired chalkboard menu for R295 a person with a glass of the estate s Vineyard Selection wines, or a multi-course menu. This year, for the first time, we are branching out to offer a multi-course tasting menu, Broughton explained. This entails a selection of any four dishes from the menu served in smaller portions with or without a wine pairing.The cost is R395 or R495 respectively per person. Of course, the normal menu is also available. At the launch, we sampled the four-course menu, starting with a delectable sesame-crusted Norwegian salmon with a white bean and miso puree, tofu, nasturtium leaves, an aubergine crisp and punchy ginger-infused Vietnamese dressing. This was paired with a non-vintage MCC from the estate a clean, fresh pairing of bubbly to counter the oils in the salmon.First course stuck with a pescatarian theme: seared kingklip with a bean ragout and langoustines and crunchy brunoise (chopped vegetables), served with Kleine Zalze s Vineyard Selection Chenin Blanc 2016.Thankfully, these were all smaller portions.A meat main followed with dry-aged beef sirloin (top quality, pasture-reared beef sourced locally from Farmer Angus), celeriac pur e, kale and a brisket croustillant (brisket in a crisp) and a side of Hollandaise sauce.Those averse to Brussels sprouts need to experience them at the hands of Broughton s kitchen: these were saut ed till bright and crunchy, which releases their beautiful natural nutty flavours. They were utterly moreish I couldn t get enough. Our steak was served with Kleine Zalze s Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon 2015.To finish, a chocolate, coffee, caramel and whisky ice cream was paired with a noble late harvest sticky from the estate (sadly, sold out at the tasting room).My only critique relates to an accompaniment the ultra-rich French countryside staple, aligot, which is a creamy, elastic blend of Comt cheese, loads of butter, garlic and mashed potatoes. It was faultless, but out of place and possibly better served in its traditional context as something hearty served to pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela. (Now, it s also enjoyed at village gatherings and celebrations, simply accompanied by Toulouse sausage and Auvergne red wine made from the fruity Gamay variety that is used to produce Beaujolais).Terroir though is always a treat, which is why it has such a loyal support base. If you haven t visited and find yourself in the Cape Winelands this winter, get there soon. Service is accomplished, with most staff members having been there for years, and Broughton s the consummate gentleman chef. With our endless summer, the best seating is under the old oak trees, but once the cold spell hits cosy up near the fireplace.Terroir Kleine Zalze Tel: 021 880-8167 or email: restaurant@kleinezalze.co.za eNCA

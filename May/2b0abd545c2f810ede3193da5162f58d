SHANGHAI, China - It's man vs machine this week as Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo faces the world's top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI.China's 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one.

Ahead of the May 23 match between #AlphaGo and Ke Jie, let's review the AI player's record against human challengers https://t.co/dUmKinC6QN pic.twitter.com/AeCt1kJQK3 "AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered," Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week's matches.AI's ultimate goal is to create "general" or multi-purpose, rather than "narrow," task-specific intelligence -- something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn.Sci-fi nightmare?But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines "wake up" and enslave humanity.Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, "potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand."Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a "pretentious prick".After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine."Bring it on," he said on China's Twitter-like Weibo.But he has tempered his bravado since then. Pessimism looms over Chinese Go master s upcoming match against #AlphaGo https://t.co/1UD70NkJlN pic.twitter.com/8JusqUbt2A Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories.That opponent -- cheekily calling itself "The Master" -- was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo."Even that was not AlphaGo's best performance," Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week."It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well."Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory.AlphaGo uses two sets of "deep neural networks" containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught -- having played millions of games against itself after initial programming.AFP

It is critical that Eskom recovers all its revenue to be able to honour obligations to its creditors in order to remain sustainable, Brown said. I have requested Eskom to delay implementing power interruptions until the end of the month to give municipalities a few more days to make agreed payments and avoid negative impacts on local customers and the economy. #Eskom Koko says they are engaging with the municipalities involved and power won't be cut until end of MarchBrown also praised Eskom for implementing a turnaround strategy that resulted in a shift from load shedding to long-term and sustainable energy solutions. Since the injection of the new leadership, Eskom has been able to put together interventions that have been able to steer the company in the direction where we are. I am delighted with the turnaround at Eskom in line with its five-year design-to-cost strategy to achieve financial and operational sustainability, she said. Eskom has focused on reducing its cost base, delivering new plant and increasing its sales through cross border sales to the rest of the continent in order to maintain its financial sustainability.

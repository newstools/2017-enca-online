LA JOLLA, United States - Tiger Woods endured a rocky return at the Farmers Insurance Open in California on Thursday, posting the highest season-opening round of his career with a four-over-par 76.Woods, playing his first full-field PGA Tour event since returning from more than a year off with a back injury, carded a bogey-strewn opening round on the Torrey Pines Golf Club's South Course.It was anything but a happy return to the challenging coastal layout outside San Diego where the former world number one has won no fewer than eight times in his career, most notably his epic 2008 US Open victory.Woods' previous highest season-opening round was a 73 shot at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in 2015, according to PGA Tour officials.The 41-year-old's round unravelled during the back nine, when three consecutive bogeys starting on the 12th were capped with a double-bogey on the 15th. A further bogey on the 17th left him facing the prospect of finishing five over before a birdie on the last -- nervelessly draining an awkward eight-foot putt -- reduced the damage.The round left Woods 11 shots off the early leader, England's Justin Rose, who posted a seven-under-par 65 earlier Thursday.AFP

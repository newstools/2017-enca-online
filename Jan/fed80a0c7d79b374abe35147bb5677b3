RABAT A public television station in Morocco was given an official reprimand on Tuesday for broadcasting a sequence on how to use make-up to conceal the bruises of battered women.It was transmitted last November, marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, by 2M on its morning magazine programme "Sabahiyate".The sequence depicted a woman with a swollen face, with the presenter telling viewers that she was not really injured, and that these were just "cinematic effects".Meanwhile in Morocco....

JOHANNESBURG "People who don't want to be part of the traditional court processes in line with customary law, can choose to opt out." This is contained in the revised traditional courts bill, presented by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in Pretoria on Monday.In the past, the bill was slammed by critics who said some aspects were in violation of the constitution.The bill was introduced to Parliament in 2008 and 2012.Rights groups said the bill violated the rights of women and gave traditional leaders more powers and people didn t have the choice of opting out of traditional courts.The revised traditional courts states among other things that courts must consist of women and men officials.But it may take a while for the bill to become law as it still has to be passed before parliament and thereafter made available for public comment.eNCA

ADDIS ABABA For the first in its 50-year existence the African Union (AU), formerly the Organisation of African Unity, will fund all of its own operations by collecting a small levy from the duty imposed on imports to the continent.READ: Zuma in Ethiopia for AU summitDeputy Chairperson of the African Union Commission Erastus Mwencha on Friday said unlike in the past, African leaders had agreed in Kigali, Rwanda, in June last year to fund the AU operations.He said the financing of the AU was a historic decision adopted by heads of State and government. The decision directs all African Union member States to implement a 0.2 percent levy on eligible imports for the finance the African Union, said Mwencha.He said the it was estimated that at least US$1,5 billion would be raised through the levy, which was much more than the present cost of AU operations. The decision will enter into operations for each member State from January 2017, said Mwencha.Some countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, Chad and Ethiopia and Republic of Congo have already implemented the levy.READ: Can the African Union rely less on donor funding?He said in the past the AU was reliant on the European Union and other donors to fund its operations because only five African countries, including Libya, were contributing money for such purposes.The move would provide reliable and predictable funding for, among other things, continental peace and security. It would also relieve pressure on national treasuries with respect to meeting national obligations for payment of assessed contributions of the Union, said Mwencha.Africa News Agency

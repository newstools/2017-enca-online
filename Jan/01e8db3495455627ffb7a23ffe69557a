WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States on Friday and temporarily barred visitors from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries.He said the moves would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks.The order limiting entry on visitors from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries is for 90 days. The six other countries are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the White House said."I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. Don't want them here," Trump said earlier on Friday at the Pentagon."We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people," he said.History will look back on this, where an illegitimate @POTUS turned his back on people fleeing for their lives: https://t.co/2BYa6akagH pic.twitter.com/I5EIedjBGpCivil rights groups condemned the measures as discriminatory, and said they would strand refugees in dangerous places and tarnish the reputation of the United States as a land welcoming of immigrants.The details of the order - which had been rumoured for days - were not available until Friday evening, leaving people affected scrambling to figure out what it meant.The impact was immediate, causing "chaos" for Arab-Americans whose family members were already en route for a visit, said Abed A Ayoub, legal and policy director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.Ayoub said the order could affect travelling green card holders, students, people coming to the United States for medical care and others.The order is already affecting refugees and their families, said Jen Smyers of the Church World Service, a Protestant faith-based group that works with migrants.Smyers said she spoke to an Iraqi mother whose twin daughters remain in Iraq due to processing delays. "Those two 18-year-old daughters won't be able to join their mother in the US," she said.#MuslimBan won't prevent any terrorist acts on our soil. What it will do is feed ISIS rhetoric that USA is conducting a war against Islam.Trump had promised the measures - called "extreme vetting" - during last year's election campaign, saying they would prevent militants from entering the United States from abroad.The rise of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, which fuelled a flood of migrants into Europe, combined with a series of attacks in France and Belgium heightened concerns in the United States about taking in refugees from Syria.Trump's order suspends the Syrian refugee programme until further notice, and will eventually give priority to minority religious groups fleeing persecution. Trump said in an interview with a Christian news outlet the exception would help Syrian Christians fleeing the civil war there.With a #MuslimBan, the San Bernardino shooting would have never happened and 14 people would still be alive.

He allegedly forced her to travel with him to Johannesburg, Leeu-Gamka and Swellendam over nine months, during which he allegedly repeatedly raped her.Abels told the court that he took the teenager to Swellendam in August 2014, and to Leeu-Gamka in September 2014 so that she could point out the places where they had lived.At one house, the owner approached her and called her by the name Stella .Abels said the case against Sibondo was, however, withdrawn on November 5. He did not explain why it was withdrawn, but just six months later, Elda Japhta would be dead.She had moved in with him a few months before her death.READ: Judge recounts horrific detail of Anene Booysen's murderSibondo s defence lawyer, Riaan Odendaal, told the court that his client had made certain admissions that he was in a romantic, intimate relationship with Japhta, and that he had had consensual sex with her.He told the court he planned to make an application to have the two rape charges discharged.The judge is expected to hear the application on Friday.Africa News Agency

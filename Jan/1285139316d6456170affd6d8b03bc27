JOHANNESBURG A tertiary qualification in South Africa improves your chances of finding a job.Historically, university graduation has been seen as the benchmark of tertiary skills development.But recently, government has urged 2016 matriculants to rather consider studying at Technical Vocational Education and Training colleges.More than 400,000 of the class of 2016 qualified to carry on studying.The country s 26 public universities will be able to accommodate less than half of them.WATCH: Nzimande outlines plans for new academic yearThere are over half a million post school education opportunities available.And about 280,000 matriculants are eligible to study for diplomas and higher certificates.In January, Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande, urged matriculants to consider T-Vets as an alternative to university. Let me also say that while education is a key priority of government, we want to make technical and vocational education and training an apex of the post-school education and training, said Nzimande.The budget for T-Vet colleges for the 2017/18 financial year, amounts to almost R20-billion.A report published by National Treasury in 2016 shows T-Vet colleges are dysfunctional.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG The ANC Women s League has reacted strongly to comments allegedly made by the managing director of Standard & Poor's.During a panel discussion, Konrad Reuss reportedly said that a cabinet reshuffle could hurt the country's assessment by the rating agency.The women s league said this shows that Standard & Poor is not apolitical.It believes Reuss' comment undermines President Jacob Zuma's right to appoint his cabinet and make changes where necessary.The league has also accused the rating agency of employing scare tactics.It's calling on Reuss to clarify whether or not the comments were his personal views or those of the company.This comes after a report in the Sunday Times which stated that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is headed to Parliament.The newspaper reports that the ANC in the North West has asked Luthuli House to add Molefe to a list of members it wants to send to Parliament.READ: Molefe could be on track for minister positionPolitical analyst Karima Brown believes these developments could indicate that a cabinet reshuffle is on the cards. The move could further exacerbate divisions and tensions in the ANC. The reason why I m saying this is, if you look at the reaction of the markets for example, Standard & Poor's have already come out to talk about what the risks are if there s further uncertainty about who s going to be holding the public purse in SA," she said."And the ANCWL has lashed out against the company saying it has no right dictating to President Zuma what s wrong or right. This gives us some kind of context to this persistent rumour that he s coming and suggesting the president will be re-arranging the executive textures either before or after the State of the Nation address.If Molefe becomes an MP, it could pave the way for a cabinet reshuffle.Zuma supporters have reportedly been lobbying the president to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and replace him with Molefe.Molefe resigned as head of Eskom in November after he was implicated in the public protector's state capture report.READ: Get the state capture report hereANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe was not able to confirm whether or not Molefe s name is on the list of standby MPs.eNCA

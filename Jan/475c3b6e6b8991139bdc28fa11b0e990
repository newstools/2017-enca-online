JOHANNESBURG - ANC president Jacob Zuma recently told thousands at Orlando Stadium that the party is ready to correct its past mistakes. Zuma called on ANC members to end factional fights, root out corruption and to strengthen the tripartite alliance in a bid to improve the lives of all South Africans. #ANCSG - When we deal with factionalism, we need to be more scientific. You don't declare that, there shall be not factions & they disappear “We must build a listening and caring ANC. We accept that we’ve made mistakes and we shall correct them,” Zuma said. With the ANC elective conference on the horizon, many wonder how many will heed Zuma’s call and if the ANC will emerge as a united front after December 2017. #ANCTGMkhize: It is not true that President Zuma will be running for 3rd term as ANC President at the upcoming National Conf.

OTTAWA - World number three Milos Raonic of Canada will miss next week's first-round Davis Cup tie against Britain at Ottawa after suffering his fourth adductor muscle injury in 12 months.Peter Polansky will replace Raonic in the Canadian lineup for the February 3-5 event after last year's Wimbledon runner-up was hurt in an Australian Open quarter-final loss to Spain's Rafael Nadal."I am sad and disappointed that I am unable to compete alongside the Canadian Davis Cup team versus Great Britain," Raonic said. "I sustained an injury during my previous match in Australia that will keep me off the court for the coming weeks."Polansky will join Daniel Nestor, Vasek Pospisil and Denis Shapovalov for Canada while Britain, the 2015 champions, will feature Kyle Edmund, Daniel Evans, Dominic Inglot and Jamie Murray.The Canada-Britain winner advances to a quarter-final tie in April against either France or Japan."We wish Milos all the best with his recovery and know he would be on the court with us if he could," Canadian captain Martin Laurendeau said. "Our goal remains the same: to do everything we can to get the win and advance to the quarter-finals."Polansky, ranked 132nd, returns for his first Davis Cup tie since 2014. He made a first-round exit at Melbourne.AFP

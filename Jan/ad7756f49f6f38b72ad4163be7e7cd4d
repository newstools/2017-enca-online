JOHANNESBURG - A Cradock woman, photographed sitting in a cage on the back of a bakkie, said she chose to climb in there because it was "too hot" to sit in the vehicle. The photograph, which went viral on social media sparked outrage. Why would the lady jump into the cage when there's plenty space in the bakkie? There is space in that bakkie. That man's is a racist and a liar. Kha valeliwe. Linda Steenekamp said she was offered a lift into town to the local clinic by the driver who had delivered sheep at their farm. "He gave me a 'hike'", she said. Steenekamp said she climbed into the cage on the back of the bakkie because the remaining space inside the vehicle was too narrow to sit in. She denied that she was forced into that situation, saying it was "too hot to sit in the front". The owner of the bakkie Johan Erasmus admitted to eNCA that he was driving the bakkie and agreed that he allowed her to climb into the back. He said he often gave people lifts into town as he felt sorry for them, having to walk long distances. The picture caused mixed reactions with some saying the image was too reminiscent of South Africa's oppressive past. READ NEXT - A photograph: beyond black and white eNCA

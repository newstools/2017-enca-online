 HANOI - After learning to use a laser engraving machine in a Vietnamese engineering school, Nguyen Van Minh isputting the technology to an unexpected use: decorating fruit.It is a modern twist on the traditional custom of hand-carving designs into watermelons on the occasion of the lunar new year, a holiday known as Tet in Vietnam that kicks off on 28 January."Laser carving is more accurate and better for small patterns. Plus the designs are more diverse," the 27-year-old entrepreneur told AFP as a laser beam rapidly etched an elaborate rooster design into the green rind of a bowling ball-sized melon.From giant pomelos to gold-dusted coconuts, Vietnam's markets fill up with an array of novelty fruits ahead of Tet.WATCH: Salt Bae seasons the internetThe designer produce is often gifted to colleagues and relatives, or kept at home as decorations.Minh's Hanoi-based company is now churning out scores of decorated and polished melons at a fraction of the speed that it takes traditional carvers to chisel away at the fruit's peel by hand.In the Chinese zodiac's Year of the Rooster, the bird is without a doubt this season's must have emblem.Other popular designs include dragons, phoenixes and messages wishing good fortune or wealth.With melons costing about $1.50 to $3.50 (R20 to R47) a pop, Minh says his company has yet to be graced by riches."Our profits are not good, but we still want to do it because this is a new business, and also because we re passionate about it," he told AFP.As far as wishes for the new year, Minh says he has only one: a fruitful business.AFP

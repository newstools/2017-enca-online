JOHANNESBURG The Egyptian army has confirmed that it killed 19 militants associated with the Islamic State (IS), and arrested 12 others, following a sweeping five-day military campaign in the northern Sinai Peninsula.Two army officers and two conscripts also died during the campaign when an improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated on a road used by the army, Egypt s Daily News reported on Monday. As a continuation of efforts exerted by the armed forces to hunt down terrorists, forces from the second field army continued a five-day sweeping operation that resulted in the destruction of 28 residences owned by militants which had been used to monitor and hide, army spokesman Tamer El Rafai said in a statement.During the sweep, 47 residences were also inspected as the army searched for tunnels used by the militants.Two bomb-laden vehicles, two workshops for manufacturing explosives and five IEDs were destroyed following their discovery by the military.Six four-wheel drives, three motorbikes and five other vehicles belonging to the extremists were also confiscated during the raid, while two underground stores, containing six tonnes of explosives, were discovered.Egyptian security forces have been battling militants, most of them from the Sinai Province group, in the restive Sinai Peninsula since 2013 following the overthrow of former president Muhammad Morsi who became Egypt s first democratically elected president in 2012.Morsi was overthrown by the military in 2013 in what critics have described as a coup led by former Egyptian army chief Abdul Fatteh El Sisi, who is now president.Africa News Agency

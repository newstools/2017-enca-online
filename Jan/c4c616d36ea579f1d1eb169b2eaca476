PARIS - Struggling Ligue 1 side Montpellier removed their coach Frederic Hantz on Monday in the wake of their 5-1 demolition by Marseille.Hantz was "provisionally suspended" almost a year to the day after his appointment as the club conducted "an urgent review to find a solution" to their plight.Last Friday's heavy defeat by their south-coast neighbours Marseille left them sixth from bottom, one point above the relegation zone.Hantz has been placed on gardening leave as a mood of crisis envelops Montpellier with a club statement declaring their situation "serious".Jean-Louis Gasset, a long-time assistant to Laurent Blanc with France, Paris Saint-Germain and Bordeaux, will work alongside ex-Bastia coach Ghislain Printant as Montpellier decide on a permanent successor.Aside from their problems in the league Montpellier were knocked out of the French Cup this month after losing 5-0 to Lyon.Hantz has born the brunt of public criticism from club president Louis Nicollin, who said after the loss to Lyon: "I'm asking myself questions about the coaching. We don't have the means to sack him (Hantz) but it's up to him to do his job."Hantz is under contract until June 2018.AFP

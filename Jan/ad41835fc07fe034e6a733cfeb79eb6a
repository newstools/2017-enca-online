Hushed talk coming out of Europe suggests that Audi is about to carve another niche out of a niche.According to the latest reports, the German premium maker, currently number 3 in the world in terms of sales, is working on a coupe version of its A3 sedan.READ: Brand new 2017 Audi A5 Coupe out!That basically means something more directly-aimed at the Mercedes-Benz CLA.Interestingly Audi is likely to cull one or two existing A3 body styles, mostly likely including the Cabrio and 3-door hatch.The A3 coupe will have four doors and seating space for four or five people. It will be pretty much the same size as the sedan, so around 4.4 metres long and 1.4m tall.The clearest sign of its departure as a niche product will be the more sloping rear roofline, which begins to fall quite earlier than normal, from about the mid-section of the roof.Some of the engines will include the new 1.0-litre TFSI with about 85kW, the 1.4 litre TFSI making up to 110kW, and a 2.0-litre TFSI pushing out 140kW, 185kW and 228kW in the performance S3 model.IN4RIDE

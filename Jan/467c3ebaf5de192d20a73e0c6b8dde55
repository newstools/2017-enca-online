JOHANNESBURG – Billionaire and Philanthropist Bill Gates says his favourite soap opera is Rhythm City. Gates said he found the soapie reflected the lives of ordinary South Africans. “Some of the storylines are a bit out there (it is a soap opera, after all), but when you see the show it really brings home how far South Africa has come since the end of apartheid,” wrote Gates on his first blog on the new year. Gates added that he is hopeful of Africa and the world getting better. WATCH: Bill Gates delivers Nelson Mandela lecture “For my first blog of the new year, I want to share evidence of this trend from a place where many people wouldn’t expect to find it—Africa. It’s one of my favorite places to go for a fresh perspective on how the world is improving. I saw this in-person last year during my trips to South Africa and Ethiopia,” wrote Gates. Gates was in South Africa last year to deliver the 14th annual Nelson Mandela Foundation lecture. Read Bill Gate's full blog here. eNCA

CAPE TOWN - The parliamentary ad hoc committee looking into the fitness of the SABC board heard on Friday that a SABC journalist was shot in the face last year with an air rifle. The incident occurred in November last year when Suna Venter --one of the journalists who took the broadcaster to court after they were fired for questioning editorial directives -- was getting into her car. Doctors later removed foreign objects from the wound, apparently from a pellet gun.Democratic Alliance national spokesperson and MP Phumzile Van Damme was alerted to the incident by Venter last year and has called on Police Minister Nathi Nhleko to report on what is being done to protect SABC journalists from intimidation.The #SABC8 continue to be intimidated.

UNITED NATIONS - The UN children's agency on Tuesday launched an appeal for $3.3 billion to help 48 million children caught up in crises worldwide amid fears of a funding cut from top donor the United States.

Not refugee children. Not migrant children. Just children.#ChildrenUprooted pic.twitter.com/Ho4j4ZM8AL This year's appeal represents a 18 percent increase from the initial 2016 request for funding. Donors contribute to the appeals on a voluntary basis.The United States is by far the top donor to UNICEF, followed by Germany, Britain and the European Commission.Media reports that the new administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to cut at least 40 percent of voluntary contributions to international organizations have set off alarm bells at the United Nations. Relentless conflicts & crises have left 7.5m children facing severe acute malnutrition https://t.co/wlSI0XWaBp #foreverychild in emergencies pic.twitter.com/nXUz32BEKw UNICEF deputy executive director Justin Forsyth said there was "no indication at the moment" that the children's agency will be hit by cuts, adding that he remained hopeful that US support will continue.Faced with rising humanitarian needs, notably from the wars in Syria, Yemen and South Sudan, UN agencies have been requesting more funding, but the donor response often falls short.READ: Children in Yemen bear brunt of brutal war - UNICEF"The impact on the ground of our appeals not being funded is children dying, children not going to school, children not being protected," said Forsyth.Almost one in four of the world's children now lives in a country affected by conflict or disaster, according to UNICEF.Aside from Syria, UNICEF's assistance in 2017 will be heavily focused on Yemen, South Sudan and Nigeria - three countries ravaged by wars that have had a heavy toll on children.

"There are consequences for global and regional security by not investing in the needs of these children for education."AFP

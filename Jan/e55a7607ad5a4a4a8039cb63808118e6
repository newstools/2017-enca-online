JOHANNESBURG - Representatives of the Gupta family have accused Finance Minister of having 'reverse victim syndrome'. #Guptas accuse #PravinGordhan of having "reverse victim syndrome" pic.twitter.com/td1VbQn09V Oakbay Investments responded to an affidavit field today by Gordhan, in which he has accused the Gupta family of running a highly organised campaign against him and Treasury.READ: Gordhan vs Guptas: Finance Minister hits back at Oakbay affidavitIn court papers, the Minister has also strongly denied the family s claims he was driving a politically-motivated plot against it.Gordhan has gone to court to seek an order barring his intervention in the Gupta s fight with four major banks.He says he did so to protect the South African economy.A spokesperson for Oakbay Investments, a Gupta family business, released a statement about Gordhan late on Monday, in which was stated: "The applicant proactively came after us and smeared our name with a flawed list of transactions - that he used his unique executive power to obtain - and then questions the manner of our response to him."All of this changes nothing. Our bank accounts remain closed and no evidence exists to prove why that is the case. We look forward to clearing our name in Court. READ: Guptas lambaste weak-kneed Pravin Gordhan in court papersWeeks ago, the Gupta's family lawyer, Gert van der Merwe promised to reveal why the family believes the Finance Minister was orchestrating a campaign against them, with South Africa s banks.Court documents later revealed the Guptas blamed Gordhan for the decision by four major banks to cut ties with their companies.READ: Treasury not interested in arguing with OakbayThey claimed he d told a business gathering that a certain unnamed family was a threat to the economy, and that this family needed to have its wings clipped -- but they also said no-one who'd witnessed these comments, was prepared to make a sworn statement.In response, Gordhan said he doesn't recall speaking about the Gupta family at the gathering in question.He said the accusations against him must be struck from the court record, because there's no evidence to back them up.He s also said it s apparent the Guptas believe he sought a court order preventing him from intervening in their fight with the banks as a form of revenge, for what Gordhan describes as the discredited Hawks investigation against him.He insists there is simply no truth to these allegations.Gordhan has asked why the Gupta's business associates repeatedly demanded he intervene in their bank fight, if they thought he was driving a plot against them.READ: Gordhan says Oakbay asked him to intervene in dispute with banksThe Minister has slammed the Gupta s response to his application as confused, scurrilous and contradictory.Gordhan has also dismissed as unsubstantiated, the Gupta s attack on the Financial Intelligence Centre certificate that identifies 72 suspicious transactions of the family businesses. He points out that Public Protector Thuli Madonsela also raised alarm bells in her State of Capture report about one of these deals the R1,3-billion Optimum Coal Mines transaction with the Bank of Baroda.In court papers, Gordhan repeatedly uses the State of Capture report to demonstrate why it's inappropriate for him, as Finance Minister, to challenge the banks' decisions to cut ties with the family.He stresses it's his job to protect Treasury from political influence.His latest court move comes as President Jacob Zuma seeks to review that State of Capture report, and have it set aside.eNCA

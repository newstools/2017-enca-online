JOHANNESBURG A 47-year-old businessman was robbed of R200, 000 at the Emanguzi area, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Monday.Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Zwane said the businessman was in his car on Friday at around 2.30pm close to one of the banks and was in possession of R200, 000 in cash. It is alleged that he was approached by two unknown suspects who were armed with pistols and they took the cash from him and fled the scene on foot, Zwane said. We once again we appeal to the community including businessmen not to transport large sums of cash. Businesses are requested to use other alternative and safer methods of banking their money and business owners should not keep cash at home rather as it is not safe to do so.

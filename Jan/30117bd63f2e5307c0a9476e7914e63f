JOHANNESBURG - A public school in Johannesburg has had to resort to illegal connections to provide water to its pupils. But Ormonde Primary was caught out after the owners of neighbouring properties reportedly complained of excessively high water bills. The school which also does not have electricity and uses a generator as its power source, has been without water since last week when the illegal water supply was cut off.

"What is really irritating is that even last year we experienced the same thing, around the same time we were told there is no toilets and there is no water and this year as well it's happening,” said fed up parent Nelly Malinga. “This is uncalled for, our kids are suffering and there is no hygiene here, the mobile toilets are dirty, if the water tanks come, it’s just a temporary measure, we want a permanent solution. I’m sorry guys for this we need to close the school down, we need to,” said another parent. The School Governing Body has pinned the blame on the Gauteng Department of Education saying it is dragging its feet.

We have raised this problem before and promises were made but nothing,” said Solomon Yapp, a member of the School Governing Body. On Wednesday afternoon, the department said it had delivered water tanks to the school, though they still have not explained why it does not have a legal, reliable water supply. Parents are expected meet to discuss the matter on Thursday. They are adamant they would not send their children to the school until the department deals with the sanitation and water problems. eNCA

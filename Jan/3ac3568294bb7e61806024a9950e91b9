CAPE TOWN Three Proteas batsman faced off in the annual Batting Master Class in Cape Town on Wednesday.The unlikeliest of winners prevailed, with a good cause benefiting from the day s friendly competition.Temba Bavuma, David Miller and Chris Morris tested their skills as they looked to score runs by hitting targets spread around the Clifton Oval.All-rounder Morris was the winner with his 36 runs much to the disappointment of big hitting Miller who could only manage 28 runs in his six overs.Miller said: I was pretty disappointed because I actually thought I batted pretty well and then he hit on 20 runs off one ball. But that was the game and he did pretty well, so I came second, not too great.

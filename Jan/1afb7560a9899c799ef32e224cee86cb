However, his blood alcohol showed he was five times over the legal limit.The ANC veteran was shown footage of himself driving. His car approaches an intersection in Greenpoint and can be seen crossing over a barrier line.This was the second time drunk-driving charges were levelled against Yengeni.In 2007, he was acquitted on such charges and a Goodwood police station commander was fired after being convicted of defeating the administration of justice by tampering with Yengeni s blood sample.Africa News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - Eskom has agreed to postpone any electricity cuts till 10 January. AfriForum applied for an urgent inderdict against Eskom on Wednesday. The lobby group wanted to stop the power utility from cutting electricity to seven indebted municipalities on the grounds that it is unconstitutional. READ: Afriforum takes Eskom to court to prevent switch-offs It says cutting the power supply will punish law-abiding citizens and businesses, for the failure of municipalities. However, Eskom annouced that it would postpone scheduled interruption of bulk power supply to defaulting municipalities in the Free State and North West provinces. "After careful consideration of the impact of the public holidays over the festive period, and the commitment made in court today during the AfriForum case, Eskom has decided to postpone the interruption of supply to these municipalities from 5 January 2017 to 16 January 2017." "This will allow all impacted stakeholders more time to prepare accordingly," the statement said. Afriforum indicated in court that Eskom hadn't exhausted other debt collection avenues.

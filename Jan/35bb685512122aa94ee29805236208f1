PARIS - Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal was so angry at seeing his superstars slump to a 23-20 home loss to La Rochelle in the Top 14 on Saturday that he immediately cancelled their vacation.Boudjellal, the controversial comic book king who has bankrolled Toulon to three European titles, demanded his players be banned from taking holidays during the forthcoming three-week Six Nations break.However, after discussions with English coach Mike Ford, it was agreed that the squad would be back at work from February 5, a full 13 days before their next Top 14 clash against Lyon."I have spoken to Mourad. We will have a week of rest until February 5," said Ford."We trained well and we had a clear, concise game plan. But the players have to ask themselves if they were ready for the battle, for the war."It's understood that the players were due to return to duty on February 8 but even that was too generous for Boudjellal in the immediate aftermath of a defeat which left Toulon 12 points off La Rochelle, the new league leaders."I apologise to the fans. I was almost expecting to lose this game," he said."Holidays are cancelled, we are going to work. I don't care about airline tickets or anything like that, it's their problem."On the pitch, a last-gasp penalty from Australian fly-half Brock James ensured La Rochelle kept up their unlikely Top 14 title tilt.La Rochelle, a solitary point behind Clermont going into the weekend, moved three points clear as they made it four straight wins and four on the road in only eight outings.James may have bagged the plaudits for holding his nerve with his 35-metre kick, the last action of the contest, but it was a pair of tries from Vincent Rattez that underpinned the triumph, the wing going over on 24 and 62 minutes.Zack Holmes and then fellow Aussie James converted and added a penalty each before the latter's final coup de grace. "It's a great result for us. They made it very tough for us but we gave everything out there and that was the key," Rattez told Canal+ Sport.La Rochelle came through despite being without props Uini Atonio and Mohamed Boughanmi and back-rower Kevin Gourdon, all called up for the Six Nations by France.Merci MaxMeanwhile, Toulon's Maxime Mermoz received a standing ovation after the match as the 30-year-old French international bade farewell to the crowd ahead of his joining Leicester.Mermoz, a 2011 World Cup finalist, was given a tumultuous reception by fans brandishing "Merci Max" banners at the Stade Mayol.Clermont will look to catch up in the title race Sunday when they travel to Bordeaux who stand one spot outside the play-offs in seventh.Leaders Clermont will be missing seven players away on Six Nations duty as well as star centre Wesley Fofana who faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after rupturing his Achilles tendon in the European Cup last weekend.Later Saturday, fourth-placed Toulouse were hosting Pau while Racing 92, still smarting from a failed European Cup campaign, travel to Lyon, looking to close a three-point gap on the play-off places.Lyon will be playing their first match at the Stade Gerland, the former home of the city's football club, but are missing playmaker Frederic Michalak through injury.AFP

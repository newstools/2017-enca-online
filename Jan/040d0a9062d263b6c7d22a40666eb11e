KWAZULU-NATAL - While KZN municipalities brace for intensified water restrictions, schools in Durban are concerned about the effect it will have on classes.Schools west of the city say they were forced to send pupils home after experiencing water cuts last week. READ: Taps run dry and water restrictions continueeThekwini Municipality says an increase in demand has placed the system under strain.Taps ran dry at the Wyebank Primary school, near Kloof, last week.The three-day shutdown forced staff to send the more than 1,000 pupils home early.One pupil was treated for dehydration.READ: National water restrictions now in placePrincipal Rashid Salot said:"It's going to continue to affect teaching and learning because ... if there's no water the children's hygiene, safety, health are being compromised."The school has instructed parents to ensure their children carry juice bottles filled with water.It s also considering installing a second water tank. We are educating the pupils that water is very important, every drop counts. We use it sparingly, we also encourage the children to bring their own cups so they don't drink from running taps, Salot said.Last week, eThekwini municipality reintroduced 15-percent water restrictions after a reservoir that supplies the affected areas ran dry.Officials say the restrictions were relaxed during the festive season to cater for the influx of holidaymakers.But demand has soared across the province, while dam levels remain critically low.KZN Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said some municipalities might increase their water restriction levels to level three, while others might go up to 20 percent."But of course that will be on a case by case basis and the situation is assessed on a daily basis. People should expect that higher stages of water restrictions will be implemented because if we don't get more satisfactory rains in the next couple of weeks, we are in a dire situation." Education officials say they re consulting the municipality about how to mitigate the impact on schools. eNCA

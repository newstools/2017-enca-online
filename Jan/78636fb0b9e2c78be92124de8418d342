WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday signed a decree barring US federal funding for foreign NGOs that support abortion, relaunching a battle that has long divided Americans."The president, it's no secret, has made it very clear he's a pro-life president. He wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said."The reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value but respects taxpayer funding as well."The restrictions prohibit foreign non-governmental organisations that receive US family planning assistance from using non-US funding to provide abortion services, information, counselling or referrals..@POTUS Trump is reinstating the global gag rule to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion.

It's about punishing women. https://t.co/L29WTvTlDdTrump's executive order is a "clear assault on both access to health care and free speech", the American Civil Liberties Union said.READ: Trump: Women who get illegal abortions should be 'punished'Stenny Hoyer, a Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, sharply criticised Trump for using his first week in office "to attack women's health"."It should be no surprise to the millions of women and men who gathered in protest this weekend across the country - and around the world - that Republicans are focused more on making it harder for women to access health care than on the serious economic and security challenges we face," he said.Anti-abortion forcesAnti-abortion activists cheered the move."Recognising and affirming the universal ideal that all human beings have inherent worth and dignity, is vital to making America great again," tweeted Family Research Council leader Tony Perkins, reprising Trump's campaign slogan.Recognizing and affirming the universal ideal that all human beings have inherent worth & dignity, is vital to making America great again. https://t.co/o9fRp6b36uThe restrictions were first put in place in 1984 by Republican president Ronald Reagan.Later eliminated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, they were reinstalled by his Republican successor George W. Bush, and annulled again after Barack Obama took office.Galvanised by Trump's November 8 election, abortion opponents in states where Republicans hold power moved swiftly last month to adopt draconian anti-abortion measures that in some cases pose challenges to constitutional liberties.And the new president has surrounded himself with senior officials openly hostile to abortion rights.While signing the executive order, he was surrounded by a dozen men, including Vice-President Mike Pence, who has long sought to dry up federal funding for Planned Parenthood.Trump, meanwhile, has pledged to nominate an anti-abortion justice to the Supreme Court, which could lead to overturning Roe v. Wade.AFP

MELBOURNE - Grigor Dimitrov dismantled 11th seed David Goffin 6-3 6-2 6-4 in their Australian Open quarter-final on Wednesday to advance to his second grand slam semi-final.The 25-year-old Bulgarian, whose previous grand slam semi-final was at Wimbledon in 2014, will meet either Rafa Nadal or third seed Milos Raonic in the last four."In the first set it was absolutely nerve racking," Dimitrov said."I felt that I could play well but I was not striking the ball as well as I could and I was a bit passive."With each game I was feeling a bit better and I was finding my groove. I'm just happy now." A #Dimitrov demolition!@GrigorDimitrov is into his first #AusOpen SF, def. #Goffin 6-3 6-2 6-4.

"I'm just humbled to be in the semis and play in front of you guys." @GrigorDimitrov #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/zOZC3NRBoUReuters

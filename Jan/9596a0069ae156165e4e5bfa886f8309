PORT ELIZABETH South Africa s most famous lion, Sylvester, is finally free to roam more extensively.Sylvester and another male lion were released on Saturday afternoon. A carcass was placed about 50m from a corner of the fence enclosing him. The fence was cut and Sylvester stepped out of the enclosure, headed straight to the carcass and started feeding. He was followed shortly thereafter by the younger male.Sylvester first escaped from the Karoo National Park in June last year and managed to evade capture for over three weeks.After his capture, he was fitted with a combination satellite/VHF collar to find his location should he manage to get out again.During March last year, the collar alerted authorities that he had left the park s boundary and he was tracked and returned to the park three days later.During May last year, Sylvester the Karoo lion finally moved to Kuzuko.READ: Sylvester safe and sound at new homeSouth African National Parks (SANparks) issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that it took Sylvester mere minutes to move out of the smaller enclosure he had been in since November into the larger Kuzuko contractual area of the park consisting of 15,000 hectares. On their first night out they caught a kudu and the very next morning a red hartebeest, confirmation that they can successfully fend for themselves in the wild, said Addo Elephant National Park Conservation Manager, John Adendorff. Sylvester is already showing signs of being the pride leader, on Sunday night, chasing the females off their kill, continued Adendorff.Sylvester proved that he hasn t forgotten how to hunt when he caught an adult black wildebeest on Monday morning. Now that it appears he finally has a place where he belongs, without threat, and the fact that he has bonded so closely with the younger male, we are confident that Sylvester will have no need to ever stray again. His satellite tracking collar location is monitored regularly and easily provides us with an accurate assessment of where the two are, Adendorff said.Two lionesses were also released on Friday afternoon when a SANParks vet darted them and fitted one with a tracking collar. As they tend to stick together, one collar will provide the location of both at any given time.Africa News Agency

Kia is rumoured to be working on a new small SUV / crossover.In fact, so far is the car s development that we should be able to see it unveiled as early as later this year!This crossover will play in the same space as the likes of Nissan Juke and Honda HR-V among others.The new vehicle would be sized and fall below the Sportage, including in terms of pricing.This would make sense since pretty much every car manufacturer is getting into this space.Even Kia s sister brand Hyundai is launching its own competitor in the segment called the Creta.Likely engines for this little Kia include a 90kW petrol and a 96kW, 265Nm turbo diesel.They would be advanced by either a 6-speed manual or automatic gearbox, depending on the local spec.IN4RIDE

LONDON - The invitation to US President Donald Trump for a state visit to Britain has put Queen Elizabeth II in "a very difficult position", a former top civil servant said on Tuesday.Peter Ricketts, who was formerly the most senior civil servant at the Foreign Office, said the invitation should be downgraded to an official visit to spare the queen further embarrassment.More than 1.6 million people have signed a petition to cancel the state visit and thousands took to the streets in protest following Trump's decision to ban refugees and citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries.READ: Britain wins dual-national exemption from Trump visa banRicketts, a House of Lords member who also served as national security adviser to former prime minister David Cameron and as ambassador to France, called the invitation "premature" in a letter to The Times newspaper."It would have been far wiser to wait to see what sort of president he would turn out to be before advising the queen to invite him. Now the queen is put in a very difficult position," he said.

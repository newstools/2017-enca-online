NEW YORK Michael Jackson's daughter has hit back at long-standing questions about whether the late King of Pop was her biological father, saying in rare public remarks that she has no doubts.Speaking to Rolling Stone in what was billed as her first and final comment on an issue that has fascinated tabloids, 18-year-old model Paris Jackson said she has often been told she has uncannily similar mannerisms to her father.

He never wasn't, and he never will not be," she told the magazine during an interview published on Tuesday, in which she also said she considers herself black.Jackson, who has pale skin and greenish-blue eyes, acknowledged that strangers usually believe she is white.But she said her appearance makes sense because she is mixed-race, adding that Jackson immersed her in African-American culture, including teaching her to cook soul food."I consider myself black," she said.He "would look me in the eyes and he'd point his finger at me and he'd be like, 'You're black. Be proud of your roots.' And I'd be like, 'OK, he's my dad, why would he lie to me?'"

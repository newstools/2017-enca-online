We wish him all the best in his future endeavours -- He s joining lobby group, Afriforum, to start up a private prosecutions unit with investigator Paul O Sullivan.During his 35 tenure at the NPA, the veteran lawyer became known for his ability to take on the powerful and politically connected. NPA has confirmed that Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has resigned to pursue "an amazing opportunity he couldn't refuse." @eNCA His biggest scalp is former police chief and Interpol head Jackie Selebi, who was convicted of corruption in 2010.Nel received an interntional prosecutors award for his successful prosecution of Selebi.He also oversaw the conviction of Paralympian Oscar Pistorius.During the Pistorius trial, Nel painstakingly crafted a picture of Pistorius as a cold-blooded killer who fired through a door at his cowering girlfriend. For his no-nonsense attitude, Nel earned the nickname 'The Bull Dog' as a prosecutor.Pistorius says he shot dead Steenkamp by accident after mistaking her for an intruder in his house.Pistorius was sentenced to six years in prison in July after being found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on appeal last December. The track star originally received a five-year sentence for a manslaughter conviction, that was upgraded to murder on appeal.Nel was challenging Pistorius' six year sentence, arguing it was too lenient as it was less than half the 15-years that state prosecutors sought.His stay with the NPA hasn't been without drama; in 2008 Nel was arrested on trumped-up fraud charges, while working on the Selebi case.It was later discovered that suspended deputy NPA head, Nomgcobo Jiba, was behind the arrest."We confirm that advocate Gerrie Nel tendered his resignation on the 30th of January," said the NPA's spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku.He said that Nel was resigning to pursue other interests.Nel was not available to comment. -- Additional reporting: eNCAReuters

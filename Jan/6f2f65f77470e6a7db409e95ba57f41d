It opted to take the matter to the courts instead. In May last year, then chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng annnounced that the SABC would no longer show footage of violent service delivery protests.The announcement drew an outcry from various quarters, and led to complaints being lodged with Icasa, who in July last year ruled the SABC must withdraw its decision.READ: SABC must respect Icasa ruling: ANCA few hours after the Icasa announcement, Motsoeneng said the decision would not be withdrawn, as Icasa was not a court of law .Africa News Agency

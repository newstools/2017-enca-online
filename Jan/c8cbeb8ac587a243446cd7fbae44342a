Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga made the announcement on Wednesday when she revealed the 2016 national pass rate of 72.5 percent. The matric class of 2015 achieved a 70.7 percent pass rate. Looking at provincial standings, the Free State achieved an 88.2 percent pass rate in 2016, an improvement of 6.6 percent compared with its 2015 results. Motshekga praised the Free State and the overall Class of 2016, which "was the largest cohort in the history of basic education to sit for any National Senior Certificate (NSC) in South Africa". “For the past six years we have noted that the NSC pass rate has consistently been above the 70-percent threshold. The Class of 2016 must be commended for maintaining this trend. “A possibility existed that pupil performance could drop but this did not happen,” said Motshekga. Provincial standings with progressed learners “Clearly we must continue to pay particular attention to the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo if we want to improve the overall NSC national picture. If we don’t do this, our basic education outputs and outcomes may not improve to the extent necessary,” said Motshekga. eNCA

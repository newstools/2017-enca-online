JOHANNESBURG Explosive audio recordings have cast doubt on the ANC s denials about its involvement in a so-called "war room".A secret campaign was allegedly set up to hurt the image of opposition parties before last year s municipal elections.The recordings suggest that ANC general manager Ignatius Jacobs was aware of the war room s covert operations and engaged with how it would be funded.AUDIO: Recordings reveal ANC top officials knew about war roomThe governing party has consistently sought to distance itself from the campaign.The ANC is adamant that it didn't sanction, nor was it involved in, the so-called campaign which was aimed at bolstering the party's image, while actively targeting opposition parties through Twitter influencers, stories and a TV show.PR consultant Sihle Bolani claimed that the war room led by Walter Sisulu s grandson Shaka also planned to plant fake posters of EFF leader Julius Malema holding a gun in a bid to convince middle-class voters that he was unstable.Both Sisulu and the ANC have rubbished claims that the war room would receive a R50-million budget.But recordings have surfaced in which Jacobs can be heard questioning alleged war room architect Joseph Nkadimeng about the funding for the project.Jacobs has denied that he did anything wrong and has indicated that he will sue Bolani for defamation.eNCA

We are still some way off from our rainy season and therefore, once more, call on consumers to assist us in using water responsibly. We are constantly monitoring the situation and municipalities are implementing additional measures including restrictions and tariff increases where necessary. People who violate restrictions will face fines of up to R 5,000.The city council will vote on the proposed stricter measures next week.eNCA

PARIS, France - Paris fashion can't get enough of its new enfant terrible Demna Gvasalia, whose rebel Vetements label has been ridiculing its conventions for the last two years.But the trendsetting Georgian -- who now also designs for Balenciaga -- outdid himself at a haute couture week show on Tuesday by presenting a homeless man with a coat fastened with a tie.His sleeping bag also bore a Vetements logo. Pretty sure I already own one of those bags Demna Gvasalia. @BALENCIAGA pic.twitter.com/jb1nrq1bov Couture clothes -- which are handmade to measure -- are eye-wateringly expensive, the preserve of the richest people on the planet.To twist the knife, he put his "Vagabond", as Gvasalia called him, in a raggy-necked blue pullover with the EU flag on the front.The down-and-out look, given a post-Brexit twist, was one of a parade of Paris stereotypes that Gvasalia -- tongue very much in cheek -- sent down the escalators of the Pompidou Centre art gallery.This was the "City of Light" in all its grandeur and naffness.Down the runway came the ferociously snooty fur-coated upper class matron, a black bouncer, a German tourist in see-through rain mac and shorts with brown socks and trainers, the office worker in ill-matched suit and anorak as well as the Filipina nanny in her Sunday best knock-off Chanel suit.

Demna Gvasalia raids white collar office culture, shouts out his own corporate overlords for Balenciaga: https://t.co/f8wA90lQi0 pic.twitter.com/KiijpMf7EW But there were also touching moments, the disoriented "Granny" being elbowed out of the away on the catwalk by the other urban tribes, the "Stoner", the "Secretary", the "Emo" and "Miss Webcam".Haute couture week shows often traditionally finish with a wedding dress. And Gvasalia, ever the provocateur, could not resist the temptation.His bride was a Generation Z version of "Great Expectations" spinster Miss Havisham, a ball of white tulle who looked like she had just been jilted at the altar.'Gorilla sleeves'Vetements, the uber cool collective Gvasalia leads, has always flirted at the edge of taste, with his Frankenstein suits and Stasi officer post-Soviet chic.And purists find it hard to swallow that someone who often recuts and reworks existing clothes should be allowed into couture week.Just to rub salt in the wound, Vetements called their collection ready-to-wear. "Gvasalia s version of reality is more, well, real" - Read the Vogue verdict on Vetements: https://t.co/kZX8KQ9TVU pic.twitter.com/WB29GSS8xz But Gvasalia's every innovation -- appropriating logos to trailing "gorilla sleeves", and pushing Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons' oversized look to the limit -- is followed avidly and more often than not copied.The brand's rising status was confirmed when Korean K-pop rapper G-Dragon -- who had earlier paid homage to Karl Lagerfeld at his Chanel show -- rushed back to his hotel to change into a Vetements hoodie so he could pay tribute to Gvasalia.The sense of a changing of the guard was palpable.Vetements' big new thing this time is overlong men's belts that trail down to the toes. Watch out for versions of them catching in car and metro doors across the world in the coming months.AFP

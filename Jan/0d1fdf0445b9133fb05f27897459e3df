JOHANNESBURG - Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world s largest brewer, may cut its workforce in South Africa by more than 1,000.According to Business Day newspaper, the company has offered voluntary severance packages to some of its employees.When AB InBev acquired rival SAB Miller last year -- in one of the largest corporate mergers in history -- one of the conditions was that the giant would maintain the number of employees in SAB Millers local operations for the first five years.But SAB said the voluntary severance offer was in keeping with the conditions agreed to with the South African Competition Tribunal because it was made only to certain management employees and not to anyone at bargaining unit level."It is important to note that no employee will be forcibly retrenched as a result of the merger. It is too early in the process to say how many people may opt for the voluntary offer. It is thus incorrect to say that 1,000 managerial roles will be reduced, as has previously been reported," the statement said.READ: Coca-Cola to swallow ABInBev share in African subsidiaryThe Food and Allied Workers Union criticised the offer.Katishi Masemola, the union's secretary-general, said: If the company is doing well like this one is doing well, why should you retrench? Because you want to maximise profit. There has to be a sense of responsibility to the country by corporate South Africa. eNCA

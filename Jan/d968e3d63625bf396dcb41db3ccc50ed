PARIS - A chunk of ice half the size of Jamaica which is breaking away from West Antarctica is now attached to its parent ice shelf just by a thread, scientists reported Friday.READ: Antarctic ice shelf a few years from disintegrationCovering 5,000 square kilometres (1,900 square miles) and nearly 100 storeys deep, the formation is poised to snap off from Larsen C ice shelf, creating "one of the largest icebergs ever recorded," the researchers said in a statement.A widening rift running the length of the finger-shaped, 350-metre (160-feet) -thick ice block grew 10 kilometres (six miles) longer some time during the last three weeks, satellite images revealed."The rift is likely to break off in the next few months -- if it doesn't, I'll be amazed," said Adrian Luckman, a professor at Swansea University in Wales, and leader of Britain's Project Midas, which tracks changes in West Antarctic ice formations."It's so close to calving that I think it's inevitable," he told AFP.In late December, the rupture had already extended by 18 kilometres (11 miles), leaving the future iceberg connected along only a small fraction of its length.

The nearby Larsen A ice shelf collapsed in 1995, and Larsen B dramatically broke up seven years later.Recent studies have suggested that climate change may already have condemned large chunks of West Antarctica to disintegration, though whether on a time scale of centuries or millennia is unknown.The breaking off, or calving, of ice shelves occurs naturally.But global warming is thought to have accelerated the process.READ: Thaw reveals Antarctic explorer's century-old notebookWarming ocean water erodes their underbelly, while rising air temperatures weaken them from above.The ice block currently separating from Larsen C contains about 10 percent of the ice shelf's mass, Luckman said."We are convinced -- although others are not -- that the remaining ice shelf will be less stable than the present one," Luckman said in a statement.Man-made global warming has lifted average global air temperatures by one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).The world's nations have undertaken in the Paris Agreement, inked in the French capital in December 2015, to cap global warming at "well under" two degrees Celsius (3.5 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial era levels.AFP

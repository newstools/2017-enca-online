Two-time reigning European and world champions Papadakis and Cizeron slipped to third.Capellini and Lanotte achieved a new personal best 76.65 points for their Blues routine "Cry For Me" and Boogie Woogie "Choo Choo Boogie"."We've been craving to give this programme a good go and waited for such a performance like this all season," said Lanotte. "But the competition is not over yet, it s only half of the way. We need to not care about this."Bobrova and Soloviev scored 76.18 with the French close behind with 75.48.Papadakis, 21, and Cizeron, 22, have struggled this season with two defeats in 2016, their first in two years."I am a bit frustrated though with the two mistakes that I did in the last element," said Papadakis."It was more on details, but it made us lose a few points. We ve improved a lot since the last competition, but there is still room to improve for the world Championships."The championships continue Thursday with Russia's Evgenia Tarasova and Vladimir Morozov leading going into the pairs free skating final.AFP

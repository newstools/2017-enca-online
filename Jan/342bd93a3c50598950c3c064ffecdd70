CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town has urged residents to use boreholes and well points responsibly and sparingly. While the extraction of groundwater remains free, responsible water habits should still apply as this is not an unlimited resource, Xanthea Limberg, a mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, said on Sunday.READ: Cape water wasters: expect a visit from the authoritiesDue to the severe drought across the country and the low levels of dams, residents had been encouraged to shift to alternative water sources.The restrictions on the use of potable water had motivated many residents to install either boreholes or well points to tap into Cape Town s groundwater resources to supplement their potable supply, as well as to save money, she said.However, the city encouraged residents to use groundwater sparingly or it might become depleted.READ: Stricter water restrictions loom for Cape Town The uptake of boreholes and well points is very useful in taking pressure off our dams at a time when they are reaching dangerously low levels. However, it is important that we utilise them responsibly. For this reason, the city is recommending that customers with boreholes restrict their watering to the hours prescribed in the restrictions, or at the very least limit their watering to the early mornings and late evenings to avoid evaporation, Limberg said.The city would be lobbying the government to regulate water more tightly.Residents who wanted to use groundwater were advised that they must apply to sink a new borehole or well point at least 14 days before installation.Once installed, boreholes would need to be registered. Information on how to register could be found on http://tinyurl.com/jt8ac72 Application for and registration of boreholes helps us gather information for environmental monitoring and research purposes and is not in place so that residents can be charged. Water use from boreholes and wells remains free. As a thank you, the city will send applicants and those who register their boreholes a certificate of appreciation and a free weather-proof display sign, Limberg said. Africa News Agency

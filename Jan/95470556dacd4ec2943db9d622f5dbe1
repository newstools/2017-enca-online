PRETORIA - President Jacob Zuma says the Department of Basic Education must deal firmly with principals and management teams at underperforming schools.The president insisted that steps must be taken to deal with schools that didn t make the grade in the 2016 matric exams. When I hear there is a school that only produces zero percent I always ask myself what were they doing from January to November, really everyday standing in front of the kids, really what were they doing? thats why I am saying there must be consequences if I am a teacher and no single child passes, President Zuma said.He was addressing the Basic Education Lekgotla in Irene on Tuesday.Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga and all education MECs are attending the three day gathering.The delegates came from across the country, to chart a new path for basic education and reflect on progress made since education was declared a priority in 2009 as well as the challenges facing the sector.The president said much more must be done to stem the tide of school dropouts as less than 50 percent of pupils who start school, reach Grade 12. There are many reasons for this anomaly, mostly socio-economic reasons and social ills. Whether it is financial reasons, abuse of drugs or other social challenges, we need to tackle them together. We must keep our youth in school, Zuma said.In response, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said they're not paying lip service to the problem. We have worked with StatsSA, what is forcing children out of school. Some of them are strange, one key one, children drop out due to school funds. We must investigate why does it become a pointed issue, said Motshekga.Migration continues to pose a challenge in Gauteng and the Western Cape, but the department said it has plans to deal with overcrowding so as to ensure quality schooling.The president said that education is the only weapon South Africa has to create a prosperous society and appealed to delegates to take steps to popularise Maths and Science. eNCA

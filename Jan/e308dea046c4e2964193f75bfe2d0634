JOHANNESBURG The thorny relationship between churches and the LGBT community (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) came under the spotlight this week after media personality Somizi Mhlongo walked out of the Grace Bible Church in Soweto. Mhlongo walked out of the Sunday morning services because Bishop Dag Heward-Mills s said homosexuality is unnatural.Churches that lobby to have freedoms and rights taken away from ANYONE should absolutely have their status revoked!! #GraceBibleChurchDear Churches- Preach & Teach the word unapologetically! Never be bullied by popcorn Activists #GraceBibleChurchPeople have expressed different views on the matter, some sided with faith organisations while others called for the rights of all human beings irrespective of sexual orientation, to be respected.In this week s eTAXI Talk, commuters share their views on religious leaders who speak against homosexuality.It's about time churches and the #LGBT community have real talk. #gracebiblechurch #somizi we are all human, sinners, human and gay.#GraceBibleChurch So Pastors are not allowed to preach the word of God just because ppl feel discriminated?eNCA

Mantashe; '#ANCLekgotla resolved state must buy poultry farms being closed down due to imports & find new markets for their poultry' The poultry industry is set for massive retrenchments as it battles cheap imports and heavy competition from European Union countries and the United States. As such, some major producers have to reduce their operations. Others have already been forced to shut up shop.Producers and the Food and Allied Workers Union have both called on government to act.

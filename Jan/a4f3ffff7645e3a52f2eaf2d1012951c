JOHANNESBURG - Sibanye Gold could lay off as many as 330 workers at its newly-acquired platinum operations.This comes as the miner attempts to cut costs and merge its Kroondal and Rustenburg mines.It s issued a section 189 notice under the Labour Relations Act, which serves to notify the workforce of retrenchments.It will give unions an opportunity to make presentations on how to avoid or minimise job losses.Sibanye said last year it needed to cut about R800-million in costs at the mines it bought to unlock saving benefits.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG â€“ Almost 80 percent of social grant beneficiaries who wrote the 2016 matric exams have passed. The Social Development Department says over 40 percent of them attained a bachelor's pass, giving them entry into university. Many of the social grant beneficiaries will also receive further funding from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. The social development department attributed the success of matriculants to its Isibindi programme which provides community based care to children living in vulnerable circumstances. But the department is concerned about the high number of dropouts, particularly among male pupils. NSFAS is attempting to ensure that poor and vulnerable pupils have access to funding to further their studies by doing away with the means test for social grant beneficiaries. From Monday, NSFAS will accept funding applications from pupils who did not apply during the previous window period. They have until 20 January to do so. * Watch the full video report in the gallery above. eNCA

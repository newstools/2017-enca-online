FULL FEATURE PAGE: Rite of passage deniedBLOEMFONTEIN - Initiation is a much larger process than the cutting of the foreskin, but it is largely the botched circumcision that leads to not only injury of the boys, but raises alarm over the cultural practice as a whole and brings it into disrepute. The initiation ceremony is seen as a kind of marker or starting point to becoming part of a group - knowlege of history, family, tradition and some say secret knowledge is passed down. For these reasons the tradition is considered sacred and fiercely defended. Initiation school practitioners who hold these values are extremely concerned about the erosion of their principles. Makgetha Tlahadi, who walks the fields surrounding Botshabelo with his cattle says he went to initiation in 1974 at the age of 16. He went to the mountain for six months and some of what he learned was to embody discipline and have respect for his parents.He was also taught that once his initiation was over he shouldn t go around bragging to others that he went to the mountain or reveal the secrets of the initiation."Initiation is a part my culture and cultural rituals need to continue being protected and practiced at all times.""One has to respect the initiation process and protect what they ve learnt because they went there for themselves - to better themselves," Tlahadi adds.Tlahadi says his two boys, aged 5 and 7, will go to initiation school when they are 21 and finished their studies. "My boys should follow in my footsteps."VIDEO: Makgetha Tlahadi talks of how crucial initiation was to instill positive values in his life. "I won't turn my back on my roots"Initiation school teacher, Paballo Motema says it is extremely important to hold close his Basotho culture.Motema says clearly, "I will never turn my back on my roots."He says they all listen to their ancestors and that the initiation comes from them.Paballo says that there are people who don t believe in ancestors and says that s their right but he on the other side believes in them and that, "...they keep him, his children and his entire family alive."This is a sentiment shared within the house of traditional leaders in Bloemfontein by Lelika Moloi who reiterates that the initiation is very important for black people; that it is essential to know who you are, he says. VIDEO: Cultural teachers reaffirm their committment to their culture along with footage of a coming home ceremony Recognition of identity is essentialOne important aspect and a core teaching of initiation is the recognition of a person's identity, which tends to be tied to the correct surname.In the process of initiation, cultural doctor Vuyisile Madidilane says the lack of clarity on the name of your father can lead to problems such as being unenthusiastic, detached and in more serious cases, death."The other problem is false cultural identities among groups of incoming boys. Mothers sometimes give birth to children whose fathers are never involved from the start."Madidilane says some of the boys are raised not with their rightful cultural credentials, assuming their mothers cultural identities from birth. According to him, the process becomes difficult for the child because spiritually, a right of passage is not permissible under such circumstances."I would then work to establish the identity of such a boy and declare him appropriately," he says.VIDEO: Cultural doctor Vuyisile Madidilane talks of the importance of being properly identified by your ancestors. #riteofpassagedeniedeNCA

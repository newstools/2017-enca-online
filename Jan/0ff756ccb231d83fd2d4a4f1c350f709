NEW YORK - Goldman Sachs on Monday joined the growing list of big US companies criticising president Donald Trump's executive order suspending entry into the United States by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.Lloyd Blankfein chief executive of Goldman Sachs, from which Trump has drawn several senior administration officials, sent a voice mail to employees on Sunday night outlining his concerns, according to the text of the call obtained by AFP."This is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily," he said.Trump's executive order issued late on Friday, which also suspends entry for refugees and legal US residents, prompted mass demonstrations at major US airports at the weekend.READ: Dubai airport sends back 'handful of people' after Trump banBlankfein said he was working to minimise potential disruption to the firm's staff and "focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected".Blankfein alluded to Goldman's published business principles that "being diverse is not optional; it is what we must be".Trump has continued the pattern -- nicknamed "Government Sachs" -- of appointing current and former Goldman executives to top administration jobs, despite lambasting the practice and the firm specifically in his campaign.Key Trump administration staffers who worked at Goldman include economic adviser Gary Cohn, top political adviser Steve Bannon and Treasury Secretary designee Steven Mnuchin.iNet Bridge

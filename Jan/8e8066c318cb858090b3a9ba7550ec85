CAPE TOWN - Parliament's ad hoc committee probing the fitness of the SABC board will finalise its report on Friday.Some MPs want the interim report shared with all affected parties, before it is finalised, but others disagree, saying that the committee is now dragging its feet.Committee Chair, Vincent Smith wants clarity on the rules before a final decision is reached; he has asked parliament's legal advisers to look into the matter.On Thursday, the culpability of Communications Minister Faith Muthambi in the problems at the SABC were a point of contention.READ: MPs consider Muthambi's culpability in SABC woesThe Democratic Alliance (DA) suggested that the ad hoc committee s report contain an observation that Muthambi willfully broke the law in several instances and misled Parliament.DA MP Phumzile van Damme said the committee s report needed to be specific about which laws the minister transgressed and what the consequences for such conduct should be. She also suggested the minister lied to the committee. She overstepped her constitutional duty by pressuring the board to appoint Mr [Hlaudi] Motsoeneng and she told us she didn t do that.

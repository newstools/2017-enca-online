Trucks' nephew, Derek Trucks, joined the Allman Brothers in its final decade as a guitarist.The drummer remained active and his group Butch Trucks and the Freight Train Band had been scheduled to start a US tour in March.But Trucks, for years a heavy drinker, said in a 2009 interview that he gradually decided on a more mellow life and had bought a farmhouse in the south of France surrounded by wild boar as a second family home."I've finally come to the conclusion that the great American dream, that all we have to do is buy stuff, is not necessarily the key to happiness," he told The Florida Times-Union.The Allman Brothers were often considered at the forefront of Southern rock but they disliked the term, saying it was limiting and incorrectly associated them with Confederate imagery.The band had a close relationship with former president Jimmy Carter and later campaigned for Barack Obama.

CAPE TOWN It s the final day for public comment on the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works, a financial model for affordable housing on the Tafelberg site in Sea Point.Lobby group Reclaim the City held a protest rally on Sunday aimed at drumming up support regarding the allocation of the plot.It's making submissions to try to convince government to build 270 social housing units at the Tafelbeg site for low-income households earning between R1,500 and R7,500. The idea is there, the idea is mixed income mixed used development on state land the problem is it might not be the optimal development that they proposed. So really we want what they propose to be watertight and to be the best thing that can be for that piece of land so that the best value is realised in terms of finance and social outcome, said Ndifuna Ukwazi researcher Julian Sendin.READ: City of Cape Town and partner s housing plan named best in SAThe provincial government put the matter up for public submissions last year after publishing a study that concluded low-cost housing can be developed in Sea Point.The report suggests that it could be cross-subsidised by commercial retail outlets.Reclaim the City said currently people simply cannot afford the rent in Sea Point. A lot of people are getting so exploited in this area, especially the domestic workers and those that can t afford in the area, and really they end up living in the streets. It is important for us to stand up for those people and say enough is enough, said Reclaim the City spokesperson Elizabeth Gqoboka.Transport and Public Works Siphesihle Dube said the department can't comment until the matter is finalised.eNCA

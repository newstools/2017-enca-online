SINGAPORE As Singapore prepares for Lunar New Year celebrations at the weekend, the older generation in the fast-changing city-state is worrying who will take over traditions such as making costumes for the lion dance and baking "nian gao" steamed cakes.Ham Wing Thong is working with 15 employees in Tai Chong Kok bakery, founded in 1935, to turn out "nian gao", a sticky rice flour cake customarily eaten during the festive season."Keeping tradition helps us Chinese retain our culture," says Ham, 79, the son of the founder.READ: Blog: Celebrating Chinese New Year in South Africa"Nowadays, society has changed with a new generation of people, so it is now on the shoulders of us, the older generation, to retain the tradition and pass it on."

The Chinese calendar year is based on twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.As we say goodbye to the year of the fiery monkey, we welcome his cockier counterpart."Every animal and every year has a particular characteristic, depending on the element and depending on the animal. OLAY.The typical nature of a rooster it loves it's hard work, loves to wake up early, so people who work hard can look forward to a good year. But one of the other traits of the rooster, is it loves picking fights. You shouldn't just go out there [and not think] and go picking fights like the United States president, Donald Trump. He's the typical guy now that symbolises the year of the rooster," Pon said.The lesson is that actions have consequences."I haven't ever seen like an actual firework display show. I was completely blown away. I love it! said one reveller."It's so fantastic. I loved it so much. I want to be here every year. From today nje!" said another."These last five minutes have changed my life. It's beautiful. We lived in Asia," one more reveller added."It was amazing!"said one other reveller. eNCA

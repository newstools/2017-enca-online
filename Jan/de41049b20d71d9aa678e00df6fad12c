According to early, unconfirmed reports, Volkswagen Group has overtaken, so to speak, Toyota Motor to become the best-selling manufacturer in the world in 2016.Through its brands Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu and Hino, the Japanese group sold some 10.2 million vehicles globally last year.In contrast the VW Group with its 12 brands sold 10.3 million units.The VW brands of course include the mother brand itself, as well as the likes of Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, SEAT and Porsche among others.If this information is true then it would be the first time in four years that Toyota has been unseated in this top position.We also expect some good financial results from both companies in terms of profits, although VW will most probably not be able to match Toyota due to lingering dieselgate issues.IN4RIDE

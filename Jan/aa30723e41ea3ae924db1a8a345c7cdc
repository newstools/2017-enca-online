JOHANNESBURG - As the ANC succession race gains momentum, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema believes neither Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma nor Cyril Ramaphosa is the right person to lead the ANC.Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa are expected to contest the party leadership position at the elective conference to be held in December. Members of the ANC and the tripartite alliance are already divided on who should succeed Jacob Zuma.Luthuli House has called on its members and structures not to make public pronouncements on presidential candidates before its June policy conference.

VRYBURG - The town of Vryburg in North West is working hard to pay off its municipal debt, but not all the residents agree with its plans.Electricity to the Naledi municipality, in which the town lies, was disconnected for a few days because of an unpaid Eskom bill.READ: Eskom rolls out power cuts to indebted municipalitiesBut with some of its debt now paid and an arrangement in place to pay off the rest, the town is turning over a new leaf.Mayor Neo Schalk has made an arrangement with Eskom to pay off the accounts while keeping the lights on. Before Tuesday we are ready with the R7.5-million and I can tell you we will be ready," Schalk said. "If we do not make the the R7.5-million then I can be blamed .. I m taking the bullet as the mayor ..." When power was cut earlier this month authorities realised they had to come up with a way to collect outstanding municipal bills urgently.One solution is the installation of pre-paid electricity meters, including in the Coleridge township.But residents of Coleridge insist they don't want the meters. In the first place, this whole project wasn t suggested to the community. I think they just sat at the council and decided Coleridge is getting these meters," said one resident"I really don t want that meter because that meter it is going to bring us down, said another. eNCA

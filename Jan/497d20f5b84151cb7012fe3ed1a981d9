CHICAGO - Former US president George HW Bush was released from the hospital on Monday after spending approximately two weeks recovering from pneumonia, including a stint in intensive care, his spokesman said.The 41st president, age 92, was taken to Houston Methodist Hospital on January 14 suffering from bacterial pneumonia. His 91-year-old wife Barbara, who had viral bronchitis, was also admitted to the same health facility but released just several days later."President George HW Bush was discharged today from Houston Methodist Hospital after being treated for pneumonia," Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement.During his stay the former president was intubated for 48 hours to aid with his breathing.Bush has Parkinson's disease, which has left him in a wheelchair, but doctors said it was not a major factor in this latest illness. His is a less-common version of Parkinson's that only affects the lower body.Advanced age was of greater concern.The former president and first lady received many messages of support, doctors said, including from a family that hand-delivered a get-well card which hung in the former president's hospital room."He is thankful for the many prayers and kind messages he received during his stay, as well as the world-class care that both his doctors and nurses provided," McGrath said.Bush, who served as commander-in-chief from 1989 to 1993, is the oldest of the five living former US presidents.He is father to former president George W Bush (2001-2009) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who was a contender in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.AFP

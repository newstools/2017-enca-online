PARIS - Raoul Peck's Oscar-nominated documentary "I Am Not Your Negro" presents the raw, "unfiltered" voice of US civil rights stalwart James Baldwin through his own words, the Haitian filmmaker says."He invented a language of incredible force," Peck told AFP, calling the novelist, essayist and poet the literary "father of everyone" who influenced authors from Beat Generation idol Allen Ginsberg to Nobel literature laureate Toni Morrison."The title is obviously a provocation," said Peck, president of La Femis, France's most prestigious film school.He summed up the thinking of Baldwin, who was black and gay, by saying: "You can't park me in the ghettos and lynch me without becoming monsters."Baldwin escaped American racism and homophobia in 1948, taking refuge in Paris for more than a decade before returning home to lead a nationwide campaign against segregation.It was in Paris that the Harlem-born Baldwin wrote his semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story "Go Tell It on the Mountain".Watch the trailer for James Baldwin s #IAmNotYourNegro, the film critics are calling essential viewing for all Americans.

After four years of exchanges, she handed over 30 pages of notes that Baldwin made for "Remember This House", a book that remained unfinished when he died aged 63 in 1987.She told Peck, "You'll know what to do with them", the director recalled.The previously unpublished notes gave him an "entrance" into the film project he had begun several years earlier.In the film, Peck envisions the book on US race relations through the lives and assassinations of King, Evers and Malcolm X.The documentary is entirely in Baldwin's words, "unfiltered" so the audience can hear them, he said.The film also takes on Hollywood for "fabricating the Negro", Peck said, asserting that the US film industry was built on the history of "two unspeakable genocides" -- that of Native and African Americans.Film critics have their share of blame for the "missing image" of the black man in films. "They collaborated" whether or not they meant to, Peck argued."The dominant white male has a stranglehold on history," he said.AFP

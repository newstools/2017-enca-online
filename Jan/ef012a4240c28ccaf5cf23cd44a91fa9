JOHANNESBURG Magistrate Peter du Plessis has granted the State application for a postponement in the terror-accused Thulsie twin case until late April.Brandon Lee and Tony Lee Thulsie have been in custody since their arrest last July.The State has three months to obtain additional evidence from international agencies, which it says is relevant to the twins' case.Police didn t intend to arrest them at the time and only had a search-and-seizure warrant.READ: Investigating officer hammered in Thulsie twins' caseInvestigating officer Wynand Olivier testified he used his discretion, and decided to arrest the twins based on the strength of prima facie evidence that was uncovered at their homes.The State also believed the twins to be a flight risk, as they indicated themselves they d already tried to leave the country twice, to join Islamic State. Police have charged the twins with planning to blow up US and Jewish interests in South Africa. Prosecutor Chris MacAdam also says new information obtained off electronic devices, shows they planned to target three embassies in South Africa. The defence says the State s evidence is flimsy and has accused police of prematurely arresting the twins, while continuing their investigation. Defence advocate Anneline van den Heever told the court the State is putting the cart before the horse.The NPA said it was pleased with the court s ruling.NPA South Gauteng spokesperson, Phindi Louw said: "As the NPA we have held the view that we are justified in making that application for a further postponement and we are happy that the court has ruled as such. The State is banking heavily on evidence obtained during arrests in Britain and Kenya, that allegedly have links to this case.MacAdam says if their attempts to get information from abroad fail, the State will not waste any time in withdrawing the charges.Proceedings resume on April 25. eNCA

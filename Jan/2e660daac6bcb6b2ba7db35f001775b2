JOHANNESBURG The Gauteng education department on Tuesday, apologised to all 2016 matric examination markers who have not received their payment, citing a financial shortfall. The department is experiencing delays due to financial shortfall. However, a partial payment which included a 32 percent tax was effected based on the available budget, the Gauteng provincial government said in a statement. An approval for additional funds has been sought and the balance will be paid before the end of March 2017. Funds are available but the Department has applied to Treasury for approval to reprioritise from other programmes. The provincial government said that the department head Edward Mosuwe communicated with all the unions and has explained the challenges experienced by the department. We therefore, apologise and request all affected educators to bear with us while we deal with the situation. Africa News Agency

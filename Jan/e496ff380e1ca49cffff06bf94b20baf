Our defence was great and everybody just kept to the structure," he said.South Africa scored four tries to one in the decider, with a brace to Ruhan Nel and one to Seabelo Senatla, making him the team's all-time top try scorer with 180.Scotland claimed the third-place play-off 28-22 over Canada, with both teams exceeding expectations.Canada dumped out Argentina 17-12 in the quarter-finals, while Scotland accounted for England 14-12 and pushed Fiji hard in the semis.Scotland's James Fleming said the team's young players were confident they could beat any team on their day."They've all got the belief," he said."It used to be difficult to get to the quarters, now we're hitting quarters and semis, the young guys coming in are pushing further and harder, it's awesome."New Zealand, winners in Wellington for the previous three years and for so long the pace-setters in sevens rugby, lost their quarter-final 26-10 to Fiji.In an error-strewn display, they never recovered after Fiji's Joeli Lutumailangi found himself in open space following two turnovers and capitalised on both opportunities.The Wellington tournament failed to draw large crowds to Westpac Stadium for the third year in a row, putting further pressure to organisers to move it to another city.The Sevens World Series circuit moves to Sydney next week, where the event is already sold out.

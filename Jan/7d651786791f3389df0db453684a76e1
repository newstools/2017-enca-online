MELBOURNE Rafa Nadal returned to the grand slam big-time by fending off Gael Monfils 6-3 6-3 4-6 6-4 in a tense clash on Monday to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals.Former champion Nadal had not reached the last eight in a major since the 2015 French Open, so he celebrated wildly after closing out the two-hour 56-minute clash at a packed Rod Laver Arena. "He's an opponent that makes you feel that you're playing with a lot of pressure all the time." -#Rafa on #Raonic pic.twitter.com/Uysv4yXbcO It was not the most convincing of wins for the 30-year-old Spaniard, who was rattled when Monfils rallied in the fourth set, but the 14-times grand slam champion was clinical when it counted to keep his pursuit of a 15th major title alive.Nadal will meet third seed Milos Raonic for a place in the semi-finals. "After 10 years, finally my girlfriend gets a wildcard to come here." Smooth Rafa... #AusOpen #Nadal pic.twitter.com/RK953jWZaX Reuters

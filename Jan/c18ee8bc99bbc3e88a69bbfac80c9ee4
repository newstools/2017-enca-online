We began with protests from Monday but from today onwards it is a full strike and we will shut down Unisa campuses, said Nehawu spokesman Khaya Xaba. We took the negotiations to the CCMA but after that failed, we received permission from them to strike. Xaba says they haven t received communication from university management as of yet.READ: Unisa announces fee increases for 2017Unisa said that it has been operating on a deficit of approximately R1-billion in the last two years and that their decision has been influenced by its financial difficulties. The university is currently in the process of absorbing an additional 910 staff members as a result of the agreement reached with Organised Labour and other formations on the insourcing of previously-outsourced services, said the Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela. There is currently uncertainty with regard to the question of university fees for 2017, including likely challenges on the question of historical debt and the collection thereof. Any financial commitment that the university makes at this stage, including on staff costs, must ensure the future sustainability of the university and safeguarding of jobs . #unisa Roads blocked going into UNISA pic.twitter.com/QdINA3ScOoeNCA

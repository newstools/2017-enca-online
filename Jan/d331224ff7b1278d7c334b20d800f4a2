LONDON, United Kingdom - The British government is set to propose legislation to push Brexit through parliament following a landmark court ruling on Tuesday seen as a setback for Prime Minister Theresa May.The Supreme Court judgement found the government must win parliament's approval before starting talks for Britain to leave the European Union, following the country's divisive referendum which saw 52 percent vote to leave the bloc.May had wanted to start the Brexit process -- invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty -- without a vote in parliament, but she failed to overturn a High Court ruling that said lawmakers must be consulted."The Supreme Court rules that the government cannot trigger Article 50 without an act of parliament authorising it to do so," Supreme Court president David Neuberger said in London.A majority of the 11 judges agreed that withdrawing from the EU meant there would have to be changes to Britain's domestic laws, and therefore the national parliament had to be involved.'Nothing' changes in timetableMay's government insisted "nothing" would change the timetable for triggering Article 50 by the end of March and promised draft legislation "within days"."I trust no-one will seek to make it a vehicle for attempts to thwart the will of the people or frustrate or delay the process," Brexit minister David Davis warned MPs in a defiant statement.The government aims to publish the bill on Thursday, sources told the BBC and other UK media.

It is becoming ever clearer that this is a choice that Scotland must make," she said.The lead claimant in the Supreme Court case, investment fund manager Gina Miller, hailed the ruling as a victory for parliamentary democracy.

CAPE TOWN - The draft report on the fitness of the SABC board was formally adopted on Friday but without recommendations.Parliament's portfolio committee on communications hopes to finalise the recommendations by mid-February.READ: DA MPs walk out of SABC inquiryParliament s legal team advised that releasing the recommendations before any other submissions were received could be seen as pre-judging the matter.The ad hoc committee heeded this advice, but the DA was not happy. It doesn t mean it s cast in stone and I don t think it undermines our work at all. In fact, I think it' [gives] more credibility to what we are doing in this house, but I do take umbrage to the political U-turn by the ANC at the last minute, I really do, it undermines everything we ve done in this committee, said DA MP Mike Waters.DAMP Phumzile van Damme accused Parliament s legal team of giving bad advice and claimed the ANC was taking instruction from Luthuli House. This is nothing but a political ploy to shield people from accountability, we have discussed recommendations at length and it makes zero sense why now, at the 11th hour, suddenly we shouldn t do recommendations when we ve been doing it all along. It is political, said Van Damme. ANC MP Makhosi Khoza lashed out at Van Damme. To those who suffer from this Luthuli House post traumatic syndrome, we are not controlled, we are independent thinkers and there is no way we can make observations and turn around and make different recommendations that are not speaking to the observations," said Khoza.Despite the DA walking out before proceedings were concluded, the committee adopted the draft report in its current form.It will now be sent to all affected parties, including Communications Minister Faith Muthmabi, and former SABC board chairpersons Ben Ngubane and Ellen Tshabalala.They have until 16 February to comment.The committee aims to adopt the final report by 21 February and then submit it to Parliament.Meanwhile, it has come to light that one of the SABC journalists who submitted written testimony to the committee was shot in the face.Senior current affairs producer Suna Venter said in a letter that after the attack pellets from an air rifle were removed from her face.Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said he intended to write to the minister of police to inquire about an investigation into the shooting.eNCA

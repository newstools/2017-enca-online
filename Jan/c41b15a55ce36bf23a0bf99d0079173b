LONDON Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sane and Yaya Toure scored as Manchester City secured their place in the FA Cup fifth round with a 3-0 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday.Gabriel Jesus, City's 27 million ($33.9 million, 31.7 million euros) signing from Palmeiras, marked his full debut by setting up Sterling for City's opener shortly before half-time at Selhurst Park.Sane and Toure struck late on to rubberstamp a win that got Pep Guardiola's side back to winning ways after their 4-0 thrashing at Everton and last weekend's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur.Defeat ended Palace's hopes of emulating last season's run to the final and leaves them with only their fight to avoid Premier League relegation to focus on.Sam Allardyce has won just one of his first eight games since succeeding Alan Pardew as Palace manager, but having made six changes, he clearly had half an eye on Tuesday's trip to Bournemouth.

JOHANNESBURG - The rand was weaker in late afternoon trade on Thursday as the dollar made a belated comeback against major currencies on renewed optimism of greater economic growth in the US.The dollar has been under pressure since the beginning of the week as the market tried to decipher the policy steps by the incoming administration of Donald Trump.The closure of the Dow above 20 000 points on Wednesday was the catalyst as the market jump was supported by strong earnings among others from Boeing.Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) analysts said the rand had shown significant resilience in the week after breaching the technically significant level at R13.40/$. But demand for dollars from importers have been creeping into the market on this improvement Nedbank said.At 3.44pm the rand was at R13.3752 from R13.2357. The rand firmed to R13.1968 in intraday trade.The rand was at R14.3059 against the euro from R14.2255 and at R16.8198 against the British pound from R16.7178.The euro was at $1.0698 from $1.0749. The pound was at $1.2577 from $1.2633.Locally the rand was under pressure following disappointing producer price inflation data for December raising concern of further interest-rate increases this year.Annual headline producer inflation rose to 7.1% in December from 6.9% in November and a market forecast of an unchanged number.The data reflected the slightly more hawkish statement from the Reserve Bank s monetary policy committee (MPC) on Tuesday.Nedbank economist Busisiwe Radebe said both producer and consumer inflation were forecast to slow in 2017 which was likely to give the Reserve Bank some room to pause its rate hiking cycle.Much would depend on the rand she said. Should the currency hold up as it has in the first few days of 2017 and barring any excitement from other domestic and external shocks interest rates are likely to have peaked Radebe said.iNet Bridge

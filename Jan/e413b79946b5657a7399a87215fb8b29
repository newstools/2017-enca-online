The decision will enter into operations for each member state from January 2017, said Mwencha.Some countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, Chad and Ethiopia and Republic of Congo have already implemented the levy.He said in the past the AU had been reliant on the European Union and other donors to fund its operations because only five African countries, including Libya, contributed money for such purposes.The move would provide reliable and predictable funding for, among other things, continental peace and security. It would also relieve pressure on national treasuries with respect to meeting national obligations for payment of assessed contributions of the union , said Mwencha.Additional Reporting ANA eNCA

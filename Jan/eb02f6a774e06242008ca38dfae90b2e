PIETERMARITZBURG As the 2017 edition of the Dusi Canoe Marathon draws near, organisers and environmentalists are in the process of clearing as much of the invasive hyacinth as possible before the race starts on February 16.The race organisers, the Dusi Umgeni Conservation Trust (DUCT) and their partners have their work cut out for them as improved water flow and soaring temperatures have led to a dramatic expansion of the water-dwelling plant.READ: Birkett, Lance win 2016 Dusi Canoe MarathonHyacinth and water lettuce are incredibly mobile, which adds to the issue of containment and DUCT s service provider Bart Fokkens has teams along the entire FNB Dusi route. It has been tough for us this year because when we took our break over December the hyacinth really bloomed, Fokkens said. Our teams are working hard at bringing the hyacinth under control but without a helicopter this year it has been difficult to kill large patches. We have been getting help from Umgeni Water and the Department of Water Affairs along the way which has made it easier to contain however we are going to have to do a lot more work in the build-up to Dusi. It has been suggested that the best solution to dealing with the hyacinth problem is a collaborative one, and if paddlers tripping the rivers ahead of the FNB Dusi see any new hyacinth infestations they should get in contact with DUCT or Fokkens.

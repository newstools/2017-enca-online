JOHANNESBURG The new DA-led government in Johannesburg has kept a number of inner city parks closed for months.The city said they re being reclaimed from criminals for future public use.There s been mixed responses to the move, with questions being asked about the city's approach to land use.Parents who live near the Pullinger Kop park in Hillbrow said they want their children to use the park.WATCH: Ten things that anger Joburgers We live in a small flat we need to take the children to the park but we also need it to be safe. They need to put security there, said parent, Nosiphiwo Khumalo.The nearby Yeoville Heath has also been closed to the public.The city originally said it was government land, but now says it is actually privately owned.Worshippers said they need the area for services. We are refurbishing these spaces and supplying them with new equipment. When they reopen they will be more advanced than ever, said MMC for Development Planning, Richard Funzela Ngobeni.The city said the closures were temporary and the council should not be viewed as being anti-poor when in reality it was focusing on anti-crime initiatives.eNCA

Everything is a bonus for me now."Williams would rewrite history if she won. She is not just chasing a seventh Melbourne crown but also a 23rd Grand Slam to surpass Steffi Graf's Open-era record.With her sister, a potential final opponent, already safely into the last eight in the other side of the draw, Williams had to use all her experience to get past a dogged Strycova.Despite the temperature already more than 30 Celsius when the game began at 11am, Williams opted to wear knee-length black leggings and sleeves, and she made a slow start.It was Strycova who drew first blood, breaking the first Williams serve, but, with the sweat starting to drip off her, Williams immediately broke back with a sizzling crosscourt forehand.Loving my Aussie fans, you guys keep me going. pic.twitter.com/k7RaoASCMdBut Williams' first serve was still not firing, with just 33 percent successful in the opening games, and the Czech took full advantage to break to love and go 2-1 in front.It was woeful serving from both players with Williams broken again before they both began to warm to the task.'C'mon!'Williams finally held serve in the fifth game but it didn't last long when Strycova broke again to go 4-3 ahead.Another break -- an incredible sixth in eight games -- put Williams level and she then held, before a defensive Strycova saved four set points in a marathon 10th game.Williams was fired up and screaming "C'mon!" and she went 6-5 ahead before the Czech, serving to stay in the set, was finally undone on the eighth set point by a lucky shot from the American that came off her racquet frame.Strycova, at a career-high ranking of 16, is a two-time former girls champion in Melbourne but had never been past round four in the main draw.And with her nose in front Williams was never going to let that happen. A netted volley from the Czech gave her an early break for 2-1 in the second set.Strycova was wilting and Williams was in control, and despite being broken when serving for the match, she broke straight back to book her place in the last eight.

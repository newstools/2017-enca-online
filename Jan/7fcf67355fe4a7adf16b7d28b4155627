The monetary policy committee (MPC) remains concerned about the inflation outlook while inflation is expected to moderate in the months ahead and return to within the Bank s target in the second half of 2017 said First National Bank chief economist Sizwe Nxedlana.He said the stronger rand should offer some support to the inflation outlook; however risks stemming from global events could destabilise the rand in the months ahead. We believe the Bank would opt to keep rates on hold until greater policy clarity from the US emerges Nxedlana said.At 3.41pm the R186 was bid at 8.665% from 8.760% and the R207 was bid at 7.880% from 7.970%.The market reaction to the unchanged rate decision proved to be a bit more than the nonevent predicted by analysts earlier.The firmer trend in local bonds was also driven by renewed weakness in US treasuries.

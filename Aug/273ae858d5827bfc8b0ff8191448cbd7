PRETORIA - Pretoria West High School pupils boycotted classes on Friday demanding to wear skinny pants instead of regular-cut pants. The pupils say they want the school to change its rules so they can be more comfortable. Both boys and girls partook in the stay-away, saying that regular school pants are too big. The young protestors say they will continue wearing skinny pants until the school changes its rules. The current dress code bars pupils from the premises if they're not wearing the prescribed uniform.

"We are actually disappointed that we must be distracted in education because of things that we think are not really important,” said Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona. “Looking at the current situation, we have started writing our pre-trial examinations so we should be pre-occupied by that. “People should be saying probably our education system is not helping them yield necessary results talking about necessary things that we think are taking us forward. But really disrupting a school because of the way you want to look or people to look at you it's quite ridiculous. “Any school has a code of conduct but if you are unhappy there's structures in the school, there's RCL, SGB, you can raise your issues there until such time you reach a deadlock." eNCA

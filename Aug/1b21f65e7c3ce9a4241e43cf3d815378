 CAPE TOWN - Male tattoo artists still dominate the industry, with only about one in six being a woman.As South Africa commemorates Women's Day on Wednesday, eNCA spoke to Tarnia Arendse, one of a handful of female tattoo artists in the country.For two decades, she has battled to break into the industry and described the sexism she experienced."Obviously the people you approach are these big, tattooed men, you know, the typical stereotype of tattoo artists and I would literally walk out of the building and have these tattoo artists turn me down but also laugh at me at the same time because obviously, it's this size 4 little chick enrolling to be a tattoo artist," she said. eNCA

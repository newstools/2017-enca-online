JOHANNESBURG - Investigative journalism collective AmaBhungane says the price of Oakbay's media companies was grossly over-inflated. Other commentators say it is a "sweetheart deal" designed to get financing after major banks cut the Gupta family off. TV news channel ANN7 and The New Age newspaper were sold to a company owned by Mzwanele Manyi, a former government spokesman and supporter of the Gupta family, for R450-million. "I see that some analysts have already said this is a major over-valuation of the companies, which seem to depend on government patronage for their survival," said Sam Sole, Amabhungane founding partner, on Monday.

The deal raised eyebrows on twitter too. I've never run a newspaper but did run eNCA 24hr news for nearly 10 years. No chance #ANN7 is profitable or worth R300m. ANN7 deal shows what ‘radical economic transformation’ really means #savesa #ann7 #newage #manyi #futuresa https://t.co/xXkkew9vu4 pic.twitter.com/bcYuQdjfMR Lodidox is not paying R450m to buy TNA and ANN&. Seller is lending them the money. So no money changes hands, just control and a large loan For everyone asking where did Jimmy Manyi get R450 mln to buy ANN7 & The New Age, he didn't. It's a vendor financing deal. pic.twitter.com/F3kHt2Pbx5 Translation: The Guptas have given Mzwanele 'Jimmy' Manyi R450m to buy their ANN7 & New Age

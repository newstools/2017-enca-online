JOHANNESBURG - The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) on Saturday called on ANC MPs to have the courage to vote for what they know is right, regardless of whether the vote is open or secret in the debate on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. “If Zuma survives, it will be a disaster not only for South Africa, but for the ANC itself, which will be condemned as a party which condones and defends corrupt criminals,” Saftu said in a statement. Saftu joined the millions of angry South Africans demanding that Parliament pass the motion of no confidence in Zuma on 8 August. “Zuma, his cabinet, and his cronies have forfeited any right to hold any office as the evidence mounts daily of their crimes which have plunged the country into by far the biggest crisis since the end of apartheid. Their record is outrageous,” Saftu said. Among other things, they had “stolen billions of rand in corrupt and illegal transactions, masterminded by the Gupta family, who had bribed a network of ministers, public servants, state-owned enterprise executives, and private businesses to channel pubic funds into their pockets”. “We see so many new revelations every day that it is impossible to calculate just how much has been looted, but it is clearly an enormous amount,” Saftu said.

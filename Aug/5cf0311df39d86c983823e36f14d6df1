CAPE TOWN – President Jacob Zuma on Thursday told the National Assembly he has never meddled in the awarding of state contracts and intended appointing a commission of inquiry to probe allegations of state capture. Zuma was replying to a question submitted by official opposition leader Mmusi Maimane. He said he had never told anybody to give a particular contract to a particular person. READ: President Zuma laughs his way through Parly Q&A session Zuma has challenged the directive given by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela that the head of the commission be appointed by the Chief Justice, not the president. He contends that the constitution makes it his prerogative alone to appoint the leaders of commissions of inquiry. #ZumaQandA Some EFF members asked to leave the house.

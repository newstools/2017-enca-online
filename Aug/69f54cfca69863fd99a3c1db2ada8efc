LOS ANGELES - Sony's sci-fi production "The Dark Tower" led ticket sales in North American theatres this weekend, but its estimated three-day take of a modest $19.5-million fell on a notably sluggish August weekend."Tower," co-produced by independent film studio MRC, had the lowest box-office-leading weekend take of the year, HollywoodReporter.com noted.The film, based on a series of best-selling novels by horror and fantasy master Stephen King, stars Tom Taylor as a boy who finds himself in another dimension where a gunslinger (Idris Elba) helps him try to save the world from enemies including a Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey). The film garners a paltry 18 percent approval on the Rotten Tomatoes review site.Second in the box-office race was war movie "Dunkirk," slipping from the No. 1 spot it occupied at its opening a week earlier. The Warner Bros. film had a three-day take of $17.6-million, according to industry website Exhibitor Relations.Starring One Direction singer Harry Styles in the retelling of the heroic 1940 evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Allied troops from a beach in northern France, "Dunkirk" has been hailed by many critics as a masterpiece.In third spot was Sony's "The Emoji Movie," a computer-animated comedy based on -- yes -- those expressive little symbols on cell phones. With an all-star voicing cast including James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Christina Aguilera and Sofia Vergara, the movie netted $12.4-million -- not so bad for a film that scores a dismal 7 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.Fourth place went to "Girls Trip" from Universal, at $11.4-million. The raunchy comedy, about the misadventures of a group of lifelong friends who travel to New Orleans for a music festival, stars Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith.In fifth was Aviron's thriller "Kidnap," at $10.2-million. Halle Berry plays a mother who will do anything to get her kidnapped son back.AFP

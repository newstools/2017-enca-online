MOSCOW - Roberto Mancini's Zenit St Petersburg regained the outright lead in the Russian Premier League despite being held to a 0-0 draw by Rostov on Sunday.The result also lifted Rostov into third, equal on 15 points with Krasnodar, who beat Dynamo Moscow 2-0 and four points behind second-placed Lokomotiv Moscow, who edged Ural Yekaterinburg 2-1 on Saturday.Zenit had beaten Dutch side Utrecht 2-0 after extra time in the Europa League play-offs on Thursday and a fifth competitive match in 14 days looked to be a step too far for them.Mancini's men looked exhausted and lacked a creative edge, while Rostov defended stoutly."My team looked tired after the Europa League match," admitted Mancini. "A draw was the fairest result."Meanwhile, Akhmat Grozny bounced back from four consecutive defeats to stun last season's runners-up CSKA Moscow, winning 1-0 in the capital.CSKA dominated throughout but Akhmat forward Zaur Sadayev netted the only goal of the match just before the break.Reigning champions Spartak Moscow were held to a goalless draw by promoted SKA Khabarovsk. They are in the bottom half of the table with just two wins from eight league games this season as pressure grows on coach Massimo Carrera.AFP

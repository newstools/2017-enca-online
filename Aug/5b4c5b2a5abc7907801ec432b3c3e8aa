KIGALI The brother of a leading critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame said on Wednesday she had been taken from her home by police along with four family members, something police denied.Diane Shima Rwigara, who was barred from running against Kagame in elections this month, was driven away by police on Tuesday, Aristide Rwigara said by telephone from the United States.Rwandan police said earlier on Wednesday they were investigating Diane Rwigara for tax evasion and forgery."Police took her and everybody else who was there, my mother, my other sister, and my two brothers, her brother said, citing a person who said they witnessed the incident.READ: Rwanda poll commission confirms Kagame's nearly 99% win"They put everybody in handcuffs and took things in the house indiscriminately. Phones, computers, jewellery, everything," he said.Police spokesperson Theos Badege said officers searched the Rwigara family home in the capital Kigali, but he dismissed reports spreading online that she had been arrested.On Wednesday evening, Badege told Reuters he was "sure they had not been arrested".

JOHANNESBURG – A controversial Durban-based pastor, accused of sexually assaulting more than 30 girls at his church, now faces a further five charges of contravening the Illegal Immigrations Act. His second bail application has been postponed to 8 September. The Nigerian-born cleric has been behind bars for more than four months  -- accused of sexual assault and human trafficking -- but his followers aren’t giving up. They’ve raised more than R100,000 to pay for his bail if he is to be released. “The church is prepared to support him because he has gathered people, that he has saved so they are able to serve him, he helps us when we needed him and now it is for us to help him,” said one of his supporters. “ We are behind Baba, we know we love him, we know the truth, we are behind the man of God," said one church follower. "We know the truth, this is why this is happening, we know there is no truth and we know he is not guilty until proven guilty.” READ: 'I am having suicidal thoughts': Nigerian pastor The pastor's legal team said the 58-year-old televangelist should be released because more than 100 homeless people his church feeds daily are suffering.

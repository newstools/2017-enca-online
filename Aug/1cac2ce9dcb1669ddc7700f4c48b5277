JOHANNESBURG - A bitter boardroom war is under way at another state-owned entity.MPs on the communications portfolio committee were shocked on Tuesday when they sat down to listen to a routine presentation by the Media Development and Diversity Agency (MDDA).They heard about how board's chairperson and acting CEO are at war with one another.The MDDA is supposed to support community journalism and promote media diverse media ownership.The three-member board of the MDDA delivered a fairly standard report on what it does with the R60 million it gets from government and the private sector.But then the acting CEO its seventh one Donald Liphoko said no, let me give you the real story, and painted a picture of boardroom hell."What I see is the three members installing a culture of intimidation, giving all interference in the operations of the agency. And the modus operandi is straightforward. They target non co-operating employees, they arbitrarily change their responsibilities, assassinates their characters," said Liphoko. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Snow fall has been reported in certain parts of the country, including the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, as well as in Lesotho. The chilly weather conditions are expected to last throughout the weekend. Before hitting the snowy slopes, here are some useful tips on how to stay safe in the cold. Cover your mouth - Keeping your mouth covered will protect your lungs from the extremely cold air.  Keep active - Brisk walking and light jogging will help keep a steady body temperature.  Stay Warm and Dry - When outdoors, pack additional clothes as well as blankets, gloves and a scarf. Remove wet clothes immediately to ensure that the body temperature doesn't drop drastically.  Frostbite - Children are more susceptible to frostbite, so if you are allowing them to play outside, look out for complaints such as tingling fingers, numbness, and the skin turning yellow.  If you are planning on a hike - Let your family and close friends know about your trip.  It is advisable to also pack a GPS satellite device that will alert search and rescue if you are are late in returning.  Watch out for signs of hypothermia - This is a medical condition where when the body loses heat faster than it can produce it. If exposed to the cold for long periods of time, the affected person will have initial signs of hunger, nausea, confusion, and eventual loss of consciousness.  Drive with caution - Roads are slippery, so proceed at low speeds.  eNCA

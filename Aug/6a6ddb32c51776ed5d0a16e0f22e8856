Maimane referred to two warring factions who have now turned to the courts in KwaZulu-Natal to intercede. Maimane was addressing the Cape Town Press Club on Thursday about the failure of the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. "I welcome the results of last week’s vote, because in many ways it unprecedented...it demonstrated there’s a profound disunity in the ANC... It's at war with itself..I think this is worth reflecting on," said Maimane. Last week, the DA was vocal in a calling for early elections as one of the possible steps to remove Zuma from power.

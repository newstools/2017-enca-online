JOHANNESBURG - The National Treasury has no plans to recover money wasted on a seemingly dysfunctional payment system.The new system, first mooted in 2005, has already cost R2.2-billion.Treasury s internal audit picked up 54 irregularities with the process, including financial controls, legal non-compliance, and payment procedures.The Integrated Financial Management System is meant to modernise and integrate payment systems of all government departments. Treasury received a tongue-lashing for failing to properly answer questions before Parliament's watchdog, Scopa, on Tuesday."I think that where we should have started and I think maybe we are wrong to have high expectation from the National Treasury," said Scopa chairperson, Themba Godi. WATCH: Treasury accounts to Parliament's watchdog"I think that where we are operating from that we are expecting better and when there are these lapses how do you, officials, tomorrow is that side and point fingers at other departments when they can say that you, national department, you are no exception you are just like any other department."If that was the case I don't think we will be questioning you this way. It is because we are expecting better. Where you ended that where you should have started."Treasury tried to give an explanation. "There is no excuse to say these things happened under our watch, but I am saying in the same breath I am happy that at least we ve got an internal audit process that functioning, said director-general Dondo Mogajane. Scopa was not impressed."But if you want to undermine us as if we are your extension we are not your department, you re here to account and you re going to account, Scopa member, Mnyamezeli Booi, told Mogajane. Scopa was told the new system will be up and running by the 2020/21 financial year.eNCA

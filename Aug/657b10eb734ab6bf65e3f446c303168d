JOHANNESBURG - The Canterbury Crusaders showed all their precision and guile to claim an eighth Super Rugby title with a 25-17 victory over the Lions at Ellis Park on Saturday. Tries from wing Seta Tamanivalu, centre Jack Goodhue and number eight Kieran Read extended the Crusaders record as the most successful team in the competition. The Lions played for 41 minutes with 14 men following a red card for flank Kwagga Smith. The Lions hosted the Crusaders before a sell-out 61,500 final crowd at Ellis Park stadium. The Crusaders were ahead at halftime with a score of 15-3. It is the second successive final for the Lions, who were well beaten in alien wet conditions by the Hurricanes in Wellington last year. While the Christchurch-based Crusaders have won four more titles than any other franchise, the last came in 2008 with two second places since. - Additional reporting AFP !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); Reuters

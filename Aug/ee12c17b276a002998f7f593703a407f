JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament (MP), Makhosi Khoza says the governing party shouldn’t be celebrating President Jacob Zuma surviving the no confidence vote. She says those protecting Zuma in Parliament are on the wrong side of history. Khoza says she’ll continue fighting for what’s right despite her and her children being threatened. "I'm made of human flesh and blood and my children are everything to me. If there's one thing that breaks me, it's the pain that my children are going through but I won't stop, I won't stop," said Khoza. Khoza told journalists at the Menell Media Exchange in Johannesburg she lives her life on the run.

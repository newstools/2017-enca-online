JOHANNESBURG - Bullying at schools is moving from the playground to the classroom, where teachers are now being targeted. Many say pupils are increasingly abusing them. Some teachers have told eNCA's current affairs show, Checkpoint, about being slapped, kicked and nearly stabbed. The Gauteng Education Department said 21 teachers reported being assaulted last year. A total of 25 cases were reported in 2015, and 10 in 2014. The province’s Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, is worried. "We have to change the way we deal with these cases." said Lesufi. "We must be merciless on those who don’t want to learn in the school environment.“ But until then, many teachers face more violence in the classroom. * Catch the full story on Checkpoint on Tuesday night at 9.30pm on eNCA, and 10pm on eTV. eNCA

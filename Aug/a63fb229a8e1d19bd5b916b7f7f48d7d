JOHANNESBURG - One of the Gupta brothers, Atul said the family never asked the British PR firm, Bell Pottinger, to spread the ideology of white monopoly capital.In an interview with BBC Radio on Tuesday, Atul Gupta said he does not know where the phrase comes from."White monopoly capital, if you go and search any revolutionary speech in this country, has always existed. I don t know where this narrative comes from. I don t think its from any one of our professional advisors. I don t think so I will be shocked. It s very unheard of. They [Bell Pottinger] are very professional people. I believe they should not do anything like that, neither us nor them," he said.Gupta also disputed the authenticity of the so-called #GuptaLeaks - hundreds of thousands of emails and documents revealing the extent of the Guptas' influence over government and state-owned enterprises.WATCH: Kgosana says Gupta emails are real but denies Gupta wedding claimsThe co-founder of Bell Pottinger, Lord Bell was also interviewed.

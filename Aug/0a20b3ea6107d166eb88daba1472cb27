JOHANNESBURG - The Black First Land First (BLF) group and its leader, Andile Mngxitama, are in contempt of a court order to stop harassing journalists. The High Court in Johannesburg made the ruling on Tuesday after it was approached by the South African National Editors' Forum (Sanef). Mngxitama was sentenced to three months in jail but the sentence was suspended indefinitely. The interdict against intimidation of journalists - which includes going to their private homes and harassing them on social media - now extends to all journalists, and not just those in the original protection order from last month. If BLF breaches the order, it will have to pay a R100,000 fine.

The initial protection order was granted on July 7, after BLF members protested outside the home of Tiso Blackstar editor at large, Peter Bruce and allegedly intimidated and harassed Business Day editor, Tim Cohen, and political commentator Karima Brown. On July 27, BLF members disrupted a discussion about state capture at an event hosted by the amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism, in Braamfontein. Sanef brought the urgent application for contempt after Mngxitama and BLF members tried to enter a Daily Maverick event, “The Gathering,” at the Cape Town International Convention Centre last week Thursday. Security guards stopped them. eNCA

TOKYO - A Japanese company has introduced a new role for SoftBank's humanoid robot "Pepper" - a Buddhist priest for hire at funerals.Chanting sutras in a computerised voice while tapping a drum, the robot was on display on Wednesday at a funeral industry fair - the Life Ending Industry Expo - in Tokyo.Nissei Eco an unlisted plastic moulding maker, wrote the chanting software for "Pepper", which was introduced by SoftBank Group Corp in 2014.READ: Tech leaders warn against 'killer robots'With Japan's population ageing and shrinking, many Buddhist priests receive less financial support from their communities, prompting some to find part-time work outside their temple duties, said Michio Inamura, Nissei's executive adviser.The funeral robot could step in when a priest was not available, he said. It also cost less at 50,000 yen (about R6,050) per funeral compared to more than 240,000 yen (R29,000) for a human priest.Buddhist priest Tetsugi Matsuo said he came to the expo to see if Pepper could "impart the 'heart' aspect to a machine because I believe that the 'heart' is the foundation of religion."The robot has not yet been hired for a funeral.Reuters

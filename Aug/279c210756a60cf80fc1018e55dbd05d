From what we understand, they were there for two hours there was no explanation given as to why there are delays. They arrived and there was no one there to explain to them when the minister would arrive. They were well within their rights. WATCH: Minister Bathabile Dlamini scoffs at reporter's questionsGallens went on to say journalists should stage walk-outs more often as a culture of "hurry up and wait" had established itself in press briefings. On Wednesday Dlamini failed to pitch up in Parliament for the South African Social Security Agency s (Sassa) briefing on the new social assistance payment tender on Wednesday. This was despite confirming she would be present at the meeting and tabling a report to the committee members. In May, she missed two parliamentary meetings in one week. eNCA's Karyn Maughan was one of the reporters who walked out of Thursday's briefing and filed this report. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Catherine McGown says that seeing her husband Stephen again after six years was different to how she had imagined so many times that it would be. McGown was released on Saturday. At a press briefing on Thursday,  his father, Malcolm, said his son had given him a hug when they were reunited -- and was strong and in good health. McGown and two other men at a Timbuktu hotel were taken hostage by al-Qaeda in November 2011. A German who tried to resist the abduction was killed. Dutchman Sjaak Rijke was freed in April 2015 by French special forces, while Swedish hostage Johan Gustafsson was released in June.

"I think we tried to get my wife going by continually saying: he’s coming home, he’s coming home. But it didn’t quite work out the way we wanted," Malcolm McGown said. " So we’ve had to say to Stephen: you know a lot of water has passed under the bridge but you’re strong and you’ve got to just do, you’ve got to carry on your life and you make the best of what it is.” Gift of the Givers was a key part of the negotiations for the release. Its founder, Imtiaz Sooliman, spoke to eNCA of McGown snr’s bravery in dealing with his wife’s death. Malcolm McGown thanked  the government and NGOs like Gift of the Givers for everything they did to ensure his son's release.

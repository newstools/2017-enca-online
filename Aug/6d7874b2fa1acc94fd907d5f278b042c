	Opposition parties have called her decision historic. WATCH: All eyes on Parliament in Zuma #SecretBallot Leaders of the opposition say all MPs -- regardless of their political affiliation -- are protected in Tuesday's vote. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said Zuma was unfit to hold the highest office in South Africa. The ANC caucus in Parliament met on Tuesday morning to deliberate before the motion of no confidence debate. Party chief whip Jackson Mthembu insisted the motion would be defeated. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said the vote of no confidence was not against the governing party, just against its leader, Zuma. Zuma has been in office for eight years. United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa told MPs they had no excuse to not vote against Zuma because a secret ballot provides a safety net for them. According to Holomisa, “We have to seize the opportunity to put the people and the country first. In this regard, let us vote against the abuse of power. The infamous intelligence report ... Let us vote against Mr Zuma, the chief architect of state capture.” ANC MP Pule Mabe called the motion of no confidence frivolous. “Any serious motion brought against a president needs to be well researched and backed by substantiated and verified reports, not gossip and hear-say.," she said. eNCA

It is important to carry that momentum into this match and for the players to perform before we head on the road for two tough away matches.Currie Cup Skills Challenge - featuring Sharkie. @SARugbymag @LionsRugbyCo @CheetahsRugby @WP_RUGBY #OurSharks pic.twitter.com/aQdvK0dFdc The Griquas are a good team and are always competitive.

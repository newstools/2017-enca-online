CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma faces a no-confidence vote by secret ballot in Parliament on Tuesday, with opponents hoping that discontented ANC lawmakers could help oust him from office. Several opposition parties will lead a protest to the national assembly in Cape Town ahead of the Parliamentary session due to begin at 2pm. Zuma has easily survived several previous parliamentary votes held without secret balloting. A 201-vote majority would be needed to remove him from power, and the ANC holds 249 seats in the 400-seat parliament. His cabinet would also be forced to resign. AFP

JOHANNESBURG Leader of Zambia's opposition, Hakainde Hichilema, wants South Africa to put pressure on Zambia's ruling party.Hichilema is in Cape Town, two weeks after being released from prison.He was invited by Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane.Fresh out of jail, the leader of the United Party for National Development spoke of his four-month detention without trial. I was put in solitary confinement, saw nobody for eight days, slept on the cold floor without blankets, without anything for eight days in a room, it's even embarrassing for me to tell you, where people went in there before I was thrown in and smeared fecal matter both on the floor and the walls of the room. So, you couldn't hide by leaning on the wall. You couldn't hide by sitting on the floor. That's terrible, isn't it? said Hichilema.READ: After jail, Zambia opposition leader is not vengefulHichilema was arrested in April, on what he calls trumped up treason charges.Hichilema said the situation in his country is untenable and that basic human rights are virtually non-existent under president Edgar Lungu. We cannot have a situation like that in our country and this is why, going forward, we need to work together to restore in summary human rights, freedom, liberties, parliament, the rule of law as it were," he said.Maimane had tried to support his Zambian counterpart in court but was deported in May. The fight for freedom has intensified over the past 12 months and democracy is under serious threat. Under the incumbent Edgar Lungu, Zambia is fast heading towards a dictatorship. Zambia is currently under a declared state of emergency and this is characterised by increased security measures and the suppression of free speech, Maiamne said.Hichilema also reminded the South African government of Zambia's aid during Apartheid.He called on the leaders to use South Africa's economic clout to cripple Lungu's rule.eNCA

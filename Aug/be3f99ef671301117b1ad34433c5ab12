CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma said he was not involved in the decision to extend diplomatic immunity to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace after she allegedly assaulted a model earlier this month.Answering a question from Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane in Parliament, Zuma said it was wrong to say he had allowed an abuse of the rule of law, as police had been eager to investigate the matter. The police were very active, were very involved in dealing with that matter, and then actions were taken, he said, referring to Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane s announcement that Grace Mugabe had been granted immunity.VIDEO: Grace Mugabe says she was framedZuma said he could not answer Maimane -- who had asked on what grounds she was given immunity -- as he had no part in the deliberations and the decision.

JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (SARS) refuses to comment on the Gupta family's tax affairs.Fresh questions about the influential family's finances surfaced amid claims of shady revenue declarations.Investigative journalism teams amaBhungane, Scorpio and News24 reported that Ajay, Atul and Tony Gupta each declared a personal-taxable income, of less than R1-million a year, between 2011 and 2013. That was despite their apparent lavish lifestyle.SARS, it seemed, accepted the declarations.The revenue service said it is legally prohibited from commenting on the tax affairs of private individuals.WATCH: Gupta family declares personal income less than R1-million tax returns: reportsScorpio investigative journalist Pauli van Wyk said the numbers do not make sense."The disconcerting fact here is when we step back a little we know that the Guptas had a lavish wedding in Sun City (in 2013). They have a massive compound of several homes in Saxonwold - one of Johannesburg very rich areas. They drive fantastic cars. They have offices in Melrose Arch."All of this you cannot do if you have an income tax of less than a million rand and that what exactly these Gupta brothers have done."So each declared, since 2011 up to 2013, that they have an income tax of a million rand or less which makes them pay a PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) of very little other than any South African earning that amount or more."The Gupta family's finances came under the spotlight again this week, as it sold its media group, television news station ANN7 and The New Age newspaper, and mining company, Tegeta Resources. eNCA

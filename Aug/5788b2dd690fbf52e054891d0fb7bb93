JOHANNESBURG - Comedienne Roseann Barr said: Women complain about premenstrual syndrome, but I think of it as the only time of the month that I can be myself. In keeping with this spirit of Women s Month, which the country is commemorating this August, students from the Wits Journalism Department asked women at their university a tongue-in-cheek question about the often taboo topic of menstruation.The project is aimed at illustrating the variety of different experiences associated with something as intrinsic to the idea of womanhood as having a period. * Additional reporting by Kayla De Jesus Freitas and Juwairiyyah JeenaeNCA

HARARE Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has again criticised former South African President, Nelson Mandela.The 93-year-old leader is not letting go of the matter of Mandela and land re-distribution in South Africa.Speaking at a funeral in Harare, Mugabe said Mandela made too many concessions toward South Africa's white minority. "I asked one of the ANC ministers, how come whites have been left with so much power and he said it was because of your friend Mandela, he is the one who made mistakes, Mugabe said. He had insisted going alone to the negotiations (with apartheid government). He said to everyone go back and I will go alone. Yes he might have been a lawyer but support was needed."READ: Don't let Grace Mugabe off, pleads victim's motherMugabe s wife, Grace appeared in public for the first time since the incident at a Johannesburg hotel where she was accused for beating up a young South African woman, Gabriella Engels.Zimbabwe s First Lady toured the Harare Agricultural show and also attended the struggle heroes funeral.

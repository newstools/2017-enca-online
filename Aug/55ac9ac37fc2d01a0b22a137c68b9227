PIETERMARITZBURG African National Congress (ANC) members, including those nominated for top positions, should accept the outcome of the ANC s December elective conference, says presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.Delivering the Nelson Mandela Lecture in the Pietermaritzburg city hall on Friday night, she said some of the ANC s current problems stemmed from bitterness of people who had been defeated in previous conferences. The problem that we have is people who are bitter and this clouds judgment and has a toxic effect on discussions, said Dlamini-Zuma, who is backed by the ANC s Moses Mabhida region for ANC president.Accepting defeat would also put an end to tensions and subsequent killings of party members, as seen recently. In the ANC we do not have a dustbin for people, so everyone should be accommodated, she said.READ: Dlamini-Zuma forced to leave Marikana while campaigning in NWWhile there were problems, each party member should work hard at ensuring that the ANC remained in power. We must make sure that we win the 2019 elections and we can do so if we commit, the ANC will remain in power. Much could be learnt from former president Nelson Mandela and his generation, who put the people ahead of themselves, she said.

TUNIS - Around 2,000 hectares of forest in Tunisia have gone up in flames over the past week, with some of the fires probably started deliberately, the authorities said on Saturday.Many of the blazes have been put down to a heatwave gripping the North African country, but arson has also been blamed in some cases. #PHOTOS: Firefighters try to extinguish a forest fire in Jendouba, #Tunisia https://t.co/nsF3L6mT36 pic.twitter.com/LI9QINtqqu "Since July 29 we have experienced a wave of forest fires -- 94 outbreaks across eight provinces," emergency services spokesman Salah Korbi told a news conference.The secretary of state for agriculture, Omar al-Behi, said "around 2,000 hectares" of forest land (4,950 acres) had been lost.

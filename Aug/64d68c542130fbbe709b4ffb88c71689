JOHANNESBURG - September will see fuel prices climb by a substantial amount.This is according to the Automobile Association (AA), commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund.READ: Fuel prices look set to rise"International petroleum prices have remained on the plateau they reached at the beginning of August, and the average Rand / US dollar exchange rate has also shown little change," the AA says.Petrol users will be hit the hardest, with an increase of 61 cents a litre, while diesel is set for a climb of 46 cents, and illumination paraffin almost 50 cents."The majority of the increase is attributable to strength in international petroleum prices, with just four cents of the hikes due to Rand weakness," the AA notes. "If oil continues to climb, South Africans should expect further pain at the pumps in the upcoming months," the Association concludes.eNCA

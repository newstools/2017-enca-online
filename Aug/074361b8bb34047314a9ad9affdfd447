MADRID - Stung by Neymar's decision to join Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros (R3.5 billion), Barcelona need to act fast to find a replacement with less than four weeks to go until the transfer window closes.Here, are five possible candidates to take Neymar's place alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in the Barca attack.Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)FILE: Liverpool s Philippe Coutinho celebrates scoring the opening goal during the English Premier League soccer match between Liverpool and Crystal Palace at Anfield, Liverpool, Britain, 23 April 2017.Targeted by Barca even before his international teammate jumped ship, Coutinho ticks many of the boxes in Barca's search.At 25 he is the same age as Neymar, already has experience of what it takes to shine in La Liga from a loan spell at Barca's cross city rivals Espanyol in 2012 and is a former teammate and friend of Suarez.However, faced with the ultimate seller's market, Barca's problem will be prising Coutinho out of Liverpool.

Juventus has no intentions of selling Paulo Dybala, But next summer things could change.

Kylian Mbappe (Monaco)FILE: AS Monaco's Kylian Mbappe looks on during a friendly soccer match between AS Monaco and Stoke City FC, in Martigny, Switzerland, Saturday, July 15, 2017.Until Neymar's departure, Barca had been one of the few big clubs around Europe not linked with the 18-year-old sensation after a breakout season in which Monaco beat PSG to the Ligue 1 title and reached the Champions League semi-finals. Kylian Mbapp told AS Monaco that he would like to replace Neymar at Bar a, he would love to sign for the club.

Eden is very happy to stay with us and to start the new season," said the Italian.AFP

It impacts morale, it slows down production and it's of course traumatizing," said Michael Catura, a Tesla production worker who signed the letter. Musk has used Twitter to criticize the union drive and denied the charges that working conditions at the Fremont facility are unsafe.A Tesla spokesperson pointed to a company blog from May that argued its safety record is improving. The automaker did not provide additional comment.That blog accused the UAW of conducting a misleading campaign, and said despite a small number of incidents, the plant has a better safety record than the industry average.- Gripes about pay -Tesla has acknowledged its employees had to work large amounts of overtime in the early days, but that also is improving and the average work week is now 42 hours."Tesla's safety record is much better than industry average, but it is not enough. Our goal is to have as close to zero injuries as humanly possible and to become the safest factory in the auto industry," the company said in the blog.But so far, Tesla has not responded to worker complaints about pay.READ: Tesla shares rev up as Model 3 deliveries to start in JulyStarting pay for production associates in the Fremont facility is $18 an hour, far below the national average for auto workers of $25.58 and even farther below the living wage in Alameda County, California, where the average wage is $28.10, according to the letter sent by workers.In addition, the letter said the paths to promotion are unclear."Many of us have worked for years with the vague promise of a raise, with nothing to show for it," said Richard Ortiz, who works in the paint shop.

We've raised these issues repeatedly, and have gotten no response."Workers, who are currently attempting to unionize the facility, also asked the company not to retaliate against those who speak out. UAW President Dennis Williams has said the union is not yet prepared to call for a vote among Tesla employees. The UAW opened an office near the Fremont plant and also has two organizers working to recruit Tesla workers.The company's share price slipped 0.75 percent in early trade, but jumped more than six percent to $347 in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings report.The share price gave Tesla a greater market capitalization than US auto giant General Motors, even with a tiny fraction of the production.Reuters

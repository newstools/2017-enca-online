It also put the spotlight on government interventions to improve their lives.On 10 August 2012, thousands of Lonmin platinum mine workers downed tools when employers said they could not afford their demands for a living wage of R12,500 per month.Employers described the strike as illegal but workers were unrelenting and the strike persisted.During the lead up to the shooting on 16 August, there were reports of intimidation and assault between members of rival unions the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Amcu.Ten people, including two policemen and two Lonmin security guards, were killed as violence escalated in the area.Then on 16 August, police shot dead 34 striking mine workers at a koppie near Nkaneng. More than 70 others were injured.Since the tragedy, the shacks have been electrified and water tanks have been placed nearby for communal use. Renting a shack costs about R500 a month.eNCA

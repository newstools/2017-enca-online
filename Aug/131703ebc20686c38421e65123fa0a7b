FOR AM JOHANNESBURG - The ANC's North West structure is heading back to court in October after its provincial general council and its largest region's elective conference were interdicted last weekend.The party's North West chairman, Supra Mahumapelo, and his executive are accused of setting up pliable parallel structures to replace existing ones that don't bend to their whims.Three regional leadership structures have been dissolved by the provincial executive in the last two years.The mandate of the leaders in the fourth region expired more than a year ago, but it has yet to hold an elective conference.The dismissed leaders believe it's all orchestrated chaos, meant to influence the party's national elective conference in December.In the video above, senior political journalist Thulasize Simelane unpacks the complex politics of the provincial ANC that could have a bearing on the party's make-or-break national leadership contest.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - An Ocean Basket franchise owner, who assaulted an employee, was removed from the restaurant chain, it said on Wednesday. Outrage was sparked on social media after CCTV footage went viral of the white employer slapping his black worker at the restaurant's Lakefield branch in Benoni. CEO of Ocean Basket, Grace Harding, condemned the incident. She said the employee was advised of his rights. The assault came just days after six white men attacked a black couple at a KFC branch in Pretoria. Then there is the racist #OceanBasketLakeField owner. Remind me never to go to ocean basket, ever!

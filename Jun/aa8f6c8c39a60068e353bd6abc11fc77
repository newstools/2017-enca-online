ISTANBUL - Instanbul residents were left alarmed after a sudden change in the colour of the Bosphorus Strait that divided the continents of Europe and Asia in Turkey's largest city.The usually blue waters of the Bosphorus transformed into a milky turquoise following the weekend.Scientist said the colour change was due to a surge in a species of plankton across the Black Sea.Some took to social media to express fears that there had been a pollution spill, while others suggested it could be linked to an earthquake that rocked the Aegean region on Monday afternoon.READ: Hair therapy boosts Istanbul's receding tourismBut scientists said there was no mystery behind the event, which was accompanied by a sharp smell.Ahmet Cemal Saydam, professor of environmental science at Hacettepe University, told the Dogan news agency that the cause was a surge in numbers of the micro-organism Emiliania huxleyi, also known as 'Ehux'."This has nothing to do with pollution," he said, adding it resuled in a boost in the numbers of anchovies, a popular supper in Istanbul.READ: Up on the roof, revamping Istanbul's Grand BazaarOne of the most successful life-forms on the planet, Emiliania huxleyi was a single-celled organism visible only under a microscope.Its astonishing adaptability enabled it to thrive in waters from the equator to the sub-Arctic.The changing colour across the Black Sea was also captured in an image taken from NASA's Terra satellite.NASA said the milky colouration was "likely due to the growth of a particular phytoplankton called a coccolithophore".Emiliania huxleyi was a species of coccolithophore."This particular organism is plated with white calcium carbonate and, when present in large numbers, tend to turn the water a milky sheen," NASA said.

JOHANNESBURG It was but less than a decade ago when Ian Callum, Jaguar s Director of Design, said he could not imagine himself designing an SUV. Now here we are, at the cusp of a second Jaguar SUV.The new E-PACE will be unveiled to the public for the first time on the 13th of July. It will be joined in 2018 by the i-PACE, an all-electric crossover that goes on sale in 2018. The combination of sports car looks with Jaguar performance will ensure that the E-PACE stands out, said Callum. Every Jaguar is designed to excite the senses, and we think E-PACE will do just that, albeit with its own individual character. In terms of size, the E-PACE is smaller than the F-PACE, meaning it s about the same size as cousin Range Rover Evoque.As such, it will sport several common engines, including the new Ingenium motors, petrol and diesel, producing anything between 140kW and 220kW.iNet Bridge

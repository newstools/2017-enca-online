FRANKFURT - Factory orders in Germany tumbled unexpectedly in April, data showed on Wednesday, but the indicator is notoriously volatile and the drop will not be enough to dissipate the generally optimistic outlook for Europe's biggest economy, the economy ministry said.The ministry calculated in a statement that factory orders dropped by 2.1 percent in April, dragged down by a decline in big-ticket orders.Analysts surveyed by financial service Factset had been pencilling in a much smaller decline of 0.3 percent in April, following strong growth in orders in the preceding two months.Excluding big-ticket items, the total volume of orders stable in April from March, the ministry calculated.In terms of region, domestic orders edged down by 0.2 percent, while orders from abroad tumbled by 3.4 percent.Nevertheless, the ministry was optimistic that current data pointed to "growth in industrial orders" for the remainder of the year.Another key indicator, industrial output data, is due to be released on Thursday, and analysts have forecast a small rebound after a dip of 0.4 percent in March.German business confidence soared in May to levels not seen in more than a quarter of a century, according to a monthly survey from the Munich-based Ifo institute.AFP

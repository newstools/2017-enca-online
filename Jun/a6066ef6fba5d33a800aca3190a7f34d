JOHANNESBURG The third-generation BMW X3 has finally been unveiled. If you were an X3 fan before, you will definitely fall in love with this one, not because it s just prettier than ever before, but also because you will be buying a South African-built product.Remember BMW has shifted production of the 3 Series from its Rosslyn (Pretoria) plant and replaced it with the new X3. BMW SA will launch the all-new X3 in November 2017.X3 has grown, now measuring 4.7 metres long, 1.67m tall and 1.9m wide. It also has a wheelbase of 2.86m. Front end design is largely about the large front grille and those big LED eyes and foglights. The side profile has some Banglesque looks, but now smoothed out such that they are no longer as sharp as they used to be. Interestingly the strong shoulder line goes from the front fender and ends just under the rear door handle, instead of going all the way to the rear. Hoffmeister kink is of course present, no doubt. Standard wheels are now 18-inches wide instead of 17, but can be specified up to 20 inches for the X3 M40i. Twin exhaust tailpipes and LED lights are highlights of the rear end, along with the automatic tailgate. The M40i also gets a sports exhaust. While on models, the launch cars will consist of the xDrive20d, xDrive30d and the M40i. About a month later buyers will be able to get a 20i (135kW) and a 30i (185kW) as well. The 20d is powered by 2.0-litre turbo diesel with 140kW (BMW SA says 135kW) and 400Nm of torque, sending it to all four wheels via the xDrive all-wheel-drive (AWD) system. BMW says it will average about 5.2 litres per 100km, achieve a 0 100km/h time of 8 seconds and top speed of 213km/h. Strangely the 20d has a smaller fuel tank than big brother 30d.That car is run by a 3.0-litre turbo diesel engine delivering 195kW and 620Nm of torque. In 5.8 seconds the 30d will have done the 0 100km/h sprint and finally stop at 240km/h, says its maker. Average fuel consumption is listed as being around the 5.9 litres per 100km mark. Both vehicles are fitted with a standard 8-speed automatic gearbox, so no manual gearboxes to speak of at all.As for the (initial) range-topper, of course it has to be petrol-powered. It is simply called the M40i and comes standard with items like DSC and ABS, DTC (Dynamic Traction Control), CBC (Cornering Brake Control), DBC (Dynamic Brake Control), Dry Braking function, Fading Compensation, Start-Off Assistant, DSC networked with xDrive all-wheel-drive system, Hill Descent Control and Performance Control. At its core is a 3.0-litre turbo engine that pushes out 265kW and 500Nm of torque, ready to make it go from 0 100km/h in 4.8 seconds, reaching a top end of 250km/h. BMW reckons you will get about 8.4 litres per 100km off this X3 M40i.Models will be sold in xLine, M Sport and Luxury Line trim variants, and feature a number of safety and comfort specifications, both standard as well as optional. These will include but are not limited to things like power leather seats with heating functions, iDrive infotainment with ConnectedDrive, a 25.9cm colour screen with Gesture Control, an engine start/stop button on the dashboard, a multifunction steering wheel and dual zone climate control. Normal boot space is 550 litres but can be expanded to 1 600 litres with the seats down. Weight has been reduced by up to 55kg from the predecessor, thanks to intelligent lightweight construction.IN4RIDE

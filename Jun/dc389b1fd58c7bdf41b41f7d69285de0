TUNIS - Tunisia on Wednesday extended its state of emergency for another four months.The state of emergency was put in place in November 2015 following a jihadist bombing in Tunis that killed 12 presidential guards.The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack.IS also said it was behind other bombings earlier in 2015 - at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis and at a beach resort near Sousse that killed a total of 59 foreign tourists and a Tunisian guard.The attacks were part of a wave of jihadist violence since a revolution toppled long-time dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.READ: Tunisians protest for right not to fast during RamadanThe government repeatedly renewed the state of emergency despite its assurances that security had improved in the North African state.A source in President Beji Caid Essebsi's office, who asked not to be identified, said that after recent attacks claimed by IS in London and Manchester, "it's better to be vigilant."The state of emergency gave much greater powers to the police and allowed the banning of strikes and meetings likely to provoke "disorder", as well as measures "to ensure control of the press."It also allowed the interior ministry to place under house arrest anyone whose activities it deemed a "danger for security or public order."In recent weeks, the government used these powers not just for counter-terrorism but also for a widely publicised "war on graft."Ten businessmen were currently under house arrest on suspicion of corruption.AFP

It depends on the quality of the water because our research has shown that the water collected from rainfall does not comply with quality South African standards for drinking, Kalebaila said.Kalebaila also said that rainwater could be collected and stored for up to two weeks before it starts losing quality and deteriorating.There is good news on the recreational front. Kalebaila said Cape Town residents who have been banned from filling up their pools and asked to cover them can now remove covers as downpours lash the province.Rainwater harvesting systems are environmentally sound, reduce water demand from the service provider and mean that water is available during future water outages.eNCA

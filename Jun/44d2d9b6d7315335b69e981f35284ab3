MOGALE CITY - Michael Holenstein, the Democratic Alliance (DA) mayor of Mogale City (also known as Krugersdorp) in the West Rand, has been removed through a motion of no confidence tabled by the African National Congress (ANC) on Wednesday.A single vote resulted in Holenstein losing his position in the problem-plagued council. A total of 39 votes were in favour of the motion, while 38 were against the motion.The ANC said it tabled the motion of no confidence on the basis of gross violation of laws governing local government by the executive mayor . We had to act swiftly and decisively to avoid the municipality falling under administration on the grounds of these numerous violations, ANC West Rand deputy chairman Mzi Khumalo said on Wednesday. Unfortunately for the people of Mogale City, this is the second time that a mayor has been removed from this seat since August 2016. We had maintained consistently that the DA/EFF coalition was collapsing the municipality through sheer incompetence and decline of service delivery since the coalition took over the city.

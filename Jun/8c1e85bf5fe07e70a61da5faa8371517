CAPE TOWN - Imam Rashied Omar has called on the South African s to unite against state capture and corruption.WATCH: We need to get rid of corrupt people within our government: RamaphosaIn his Eid address at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town on Monday, Omar urged the Muslim community to participate in social justice activism to root out the rot in government. It is palpable that our country s corruption dilemma is much more than President Zuma, the Guptas and state capture. In fact, it would be na ve to think that we are simply faced with a political crisis of leadership when it s obvious that the situation goes much deeper. For the first time in 20 years, Ramadan has come and gone without the White House hosting iftar or Eid celebration https://t.co/72QWH5XNXbThe imam said civil society needed to be more united in its critique of the state. We should be critical of those who have joined the bandwagon for Zuma to resign only because their capitalist self-interests are under threat. In this regard, it is important to call out the selective outrage of many South Africans and liberal activists.

The critical motor of social change does not lie in the support of any political party, politician or candidate president but rather in a robust, independent, well-organised civil society that holds those in power accountable for their political and moral mandates. Omar has called for better governance from the new crop of leadership that would emerge by the end of the ANC s December elective conferenceeNCA

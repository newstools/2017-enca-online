JOHANNESBURG - According to Jato Dynamics, the Chinese market racked up 6 184 706 sales in the first 3 months of the year (an average of 2 million cars a month!). Even the United States the 2nd largest market achieved nowhere near that number of sales with 4 026 256 units for the same period. Japan maintained its status as the third-largest car market with 1 553 605 vehicles for the first 3 months.Compared with last year s list of top-selling vehicles, the biggest winner is the Ford F-Series pickup, which has moved up 3 spots to take the top position after the first quarter of this year.The Toyota Corolla slips to second, while the Volkswagen Golf slips 2 places to 4th. Surprisingly, Nissan s X-Trail has shot up the leaderboard to take 3rd spot - the world s favourite SUV.Interestingly, Honda has no fewer than 3 vehicles in the top 10. The odd-ball in this list is the Wuling Hong Guang, an affordable compact MPV sold primarily in its home Chinese market.It s worth noting that Ford s local problems with the Kuga have not hindered sales globally... in fact, the Blue Oval s compact SUV (sold as the Escape in some markets) has moved into 13th spot, just outside the Top 10.Also worth noting is: By comparison, the South African top seller during the first quarter of 2017 was the Volkswagen Polo, followed by another VW in second place, the cheaper Polo Vivo. Toyota s Fortuner and Etios models occupied the next to spots, with Ford s EcoSport completing the top 5.For the full list of the world s top 30 sellers, click on the banner below or visit www.cars.co.za.

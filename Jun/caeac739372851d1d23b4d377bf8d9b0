PRETORIA The son of former SABC board member Hope Zinde briefly appeared in the North Gauteng High Court on Monday.When going down the stairs leading to the holding cells, Mark Zinde hurled insults at the judge while gesticulating.

Before his outburst, his family tried to grab his attention ahead of proceedings but Zinde kept his face down, smiling to himself.The initial assessment report from Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital declared that he was fit to stand trial and he was capable of understanding court proceedings. The report further stated that he did not suffer from any mental disorder when he allegedly killed his mother.However, his family insisted that he was not in his right mind when he allegedly committed the murder.

SANDTON - The opulent tapa's lounge, L'opulence in Sandton, held a High Tea for survivors of abuse this weekend, but much to their disappointment, hardly anyone showed up.This did not deter the organisers who are passionate about the cause and are still planning follow-up events they hope will garner more interest from women who have survived abuse.Karabo Moekena's sister was in attendance as one of the honorary guests. The event was also used as an opportunity to collect donations for a shelter in Hillbrow that houses girls rescued from human trafficking. eNCA

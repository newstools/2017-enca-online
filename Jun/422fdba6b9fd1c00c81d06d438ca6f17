Elijah Hall-Thompson was third in 20.21."It has been a long weekend," Coleman said afterwards. "I felt my legs tighten up near the end a bit -- but no excuses, it was a great race," he added.The race had already been deprived of the presence of teenager Noah Lyles, who withdrew with a sore hamstring before the race.There was another upset in the women's 200, where favourite Tori Bowie was upstaged by youngster Deajah Stevens.Bowie looked perfectly placed coming off the curve but Stevens produced a superb finish in the final 50 meters to surge clear and take the tape in 22.30. Kimberlyn Duncan was second in 22.59 while Bowie was third with 22.60.The upsets continued in the final race of the day when 110m hurdles world record-holder Aries Merritt was beaten into second by Aleec Harris.

JOHANNESBURG - The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) would take a recommendation by the Public Protector, to change the constitutional mandate of the bank, to court. In a statement on Tuesday, Sarb said Busisiwe Mkhwebane's findings were unlawful and would hit the regulator's independence by stripping it of its key aim to protect the currency.On Monday, Mkhwebane released the outcomes of several investigations her office conducted over the past few months.The Public Protector told journalists that Section 224.1 of the Constitution should state that the main aim of the Reserve Bank was to promote balanced and sustainable economic growth, while ensuring that the socio-economic well-being of citizens was protected.Currently, the Sarb's primary aim was to protect the value of the rand in the interests of balanced and sustainable growth, a key factor in inflation-targeting.READ: Public Protector defends comments on central bank"The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the Public Protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful," it said in a statement.It would take urgent legal action, it added.Mkhwebane also wanted regular consultation between the bank and Parliament, and not Treasury, as was currently the case.It would take a two-thirds majority in Parliament to amend the law.The rand weakened on the back of Mkhwebane's announcement, to just above $13.There were also fears the Public Protector's comments could contribute to policy uncertainty, with the Sarb cited by ratings agencies as a beacon of strength.Speaking at a banquet in Johannesburg on Monday night, Sarb governor Lesetja Kganyago hit back, accusing those who pretended that high inflation resulted in sustainable growth of macroeconomic populism, which he said was usually a precursor to misery.Reuters

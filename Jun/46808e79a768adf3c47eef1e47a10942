We are in a recession now, which means the country s economy has shrunk for two consecutive quarters.In the fourth quarter of 2016, the economy contracted by 0.3 percent. Stats SA has reported a decrease of 0.7 percent for the first quarter of this year.South Africa has experienced 8 economic recessions since 1961.Two of those occurred in the past 8 years.The longest recession took place in 1991 and 1992, mainly as result of a global economic downturn.The most recent recession took place across three quarters in 2009, when the country became caught up in the global financial crisis.Recession is indicated by a decrease in output in major sectors, as well as a decrease in consumer spending.The trade and manufacturing industries were the biggest production-slowers, with trade falling by 5.9 percent, and manufacturing by 3.7 percent.The retail sector, which makes up 40-percent of total household spending, and just more than 6-percent of the gross domestic product, is expected to remain weak throughout 2017, due to economic strain on domestic consumers.What does this mean for you and me?

EMPANGENI - The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has taken a stab at Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.Provincial Chairperson Sihle Zikalala says deputy presidents are not automatic successors to presidents.The party s youth and women s leagues have already declared their support for Nkosazana Dlamin-Zuma.The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has also formalised decisions on key policy issues at the closing of its Provincial General Council.Land expropriation without compensation and the advancement of radical economic transformation top the list.READ: ANC policy under spotlight at provincial conferencesFree education and the abolishment of work experience as a requirement for junior posts also feature prominently.But this conference was also about pulling the divided province together - and reaffirming support for the man in charge."The enemy does not only want to remove President Zuma but at the end they want to remove even the ANC," KZN Chairperson, Sihle Zikalala said on Sunday. "They will project him as the main problem. The problem we are facing in South Africa is the high level of unemployment of our people, is the high level of poverty. You can remove President Zuma today - poverty will still be there. There was no official word here on future leadership choices - but Zikalala said just enough in his closing speech. We do not subscribe to the notion that the election of the deputy president implies that comrade is automatically ordained to be a successor to the incumbent. If it was so, there would have been no need for elections. The provincial ANC will take its declarations to the National Policy Conference kicking off on Friday. eNCA

NEW YORK CITY - Car horns, sirens, drilling, jet overflights and restaurants where diners had to yell to be heard - New York was one of the loudest cities in the world.But America's most populous metropolis, known as "The City That Never Sleeps," launched a unique experiment seeking to provide New York with the technology to dial down the volume and address noise pollution.The five-year, $4.6-million (over R59-million) project -- the brainchild of researchers at New York University (NYU), working in concert with city residents and city hall -- was using machine learning technology and sensors to build a sound library.The idea was to record the full panoply of noises in the city of 8.5 million residents and use artificial intelligence, so that machines could recognise sounds automatically, ultimately giving authorities a way to mitigate noise levels."It is like living in the middle of a soccer stadium sometimes," said Gregory Orr, a filmmaker from Los Angeles who had lived in New York for 19 years."Even the squirrels have to chirp louder in the city in order to be heard over the din," he joked.READ: China passes new law that levies taxes on pollutionJuan Bello, head of the "Sounds of NYC" project and associate professor of music technology at NYU, said noise was "consistently the number one civil complaint" to the city's 311 telephone hotline for non-emergency services, instituted in 2003.Researchers installed the first sensor boxes, which transmitted data through wifi, on NYU buildings in Greenwich Village.They were now installing sensors across Manhattan and Brooklyn at spots selected for their diverse sounds."There are plenty of studies that show that noise has a tremendous impact on health, both short-term and long-term," said Bello, citing heart conditions, hearing loss and hypertension, which then had a significant economic impact.'Canyons of sound'In Manhattan, Bello says the effects were amplified by skyscrapers, which form "canyons of sound" and made everything louder."A lot of the sounds that you get in New York would not be so loud in other places, because of the specifics of the topology of the city," he said.The sensors were programmed to record no more than 10 consecutive seconds to avoid eavesdropping on conversations and posing confidentiality problems.Researchers hoped to index thousands of sounds which, with the help of New Yorkers, would be carefully annotated and help computers identify the source of nuisance sound immediately.It would then be over to the city to do what it can to limit it.WATCH: A noisy Church angers Yeoville residentsThe problem was clear. But the solutions might still be some way off.How, for example, could you deal with something as short-lived and unpredictable as honking?"We have to get more creative," said Bello.At present, it could take authorities five or six days to deal with a noise complaint, and required the intervention of one of 50 specialist inspectors, said Bello.After so long, the problem had often disappeared.AFP

GERMANY Swiss great Roger Federer thrashed Alexander Zverev to win his ninth title at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in Halle on Sunday.The top seed lost his first match of the grass-court season last week in Stuttgart to Tommy Haas, but was in top form all week at Halle, culminating in the 6-1, 6-3 final victory over the home favourite Zverev.Federer will head into Wimbledon, which starts on July 3, as favourite to win an outright record eighth title.Italian Open champion Zverev had won all three of his previous finals this season, but was blown away by a vintage performance from the 18-time major champion in only 53 minutes."I played great, I felt good from the start," said Federer.

After my long break, I'm feeling excellent and it's a pleasure to be back and I'm fit for Wimbledon."The 35-year-old, who skipped the entire clay-court season, has still only lost two matches this year en route to four titles, including the Australian Open in January."My goal was to keep myself 100 percent for the grass season," he added.READ: Federer claims 1100th tour win in Halle"I now hope that I'll stay healthy in this second part of the season and we'll see what happens."Federer raced out of the blocks and broke serve twice to reel off the first four games of the match.The home crowd tried their best to get behind the world number 12 Zverev, and even though he got on the board in game five, Federer broke again to wrap up the opening set in just 23 minutes.

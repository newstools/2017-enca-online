A post-mortem confirmed that Yende was strangled to death.Her family held intermittent pickets outside the sub-station, hoping that the power utility would answer questions about her mysterious death.CCTV footage showed her arriving at the sub-station, but the cameras were then turned off, resulting in questions about security at Eskom.READ: Thembisile Yende's family 'broken' over her deathNumsa s acting spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi said the union hoped that the arrest was the first step in helping the Yende family's get justice. We hope that the investigation will result in a successful prosecution of the alleged perpetrator and that the courts will hand down a stiff sentence for this heinous crime, Hlubi said.There were allegations that the suspect was a senior supervisor with Eskom management, but police said he was not an employee of the power utility.Hlubi said if these allegations were true, Eskom has no choice but to take full responsibility for Yende s death. We will continue to keep up the pressure on Eskom to improve safety conditions for our members particularly those who are forced to work in isolated places, Hlubi said.African News Agency

This musical feature is part of Google Doodle 22 June 2017. (Screenshot of Google search)The German-American was notable for his abstract musical animations long before computer graphics and the concept of music videos came into play.In 1936, Fischinger and his wife fled Germany when it became clear he could not pursue his art under Hitler's regime. When he arrived in the US, Paramount Pictures offered him a job. He went on to animate sequences for Disney's Fantasia and Pinocchio. The artist's work was largely created between the 1920s and 1940s -- and the lack of digital technology meant he often spent months painstakingly creating his paper stop-motions.Luckily, Google isn't asking you to do the same. In fact, they've made it incredibly easy to create your own composition to which it adds Fischinger-like animations.Read: Google gets tough on extremist YouTube contentThe Google Doodle offers four instruments and a variety of modifications so that your piece will sound beautiful no matter your musical background -- and it even offers the option to share to Twitter, Facebook or via email.

It's time that issues around corruption at SAA be addressed, said the organisation s president, Zazi Sibanyoni-Mugambi.The document highlights alleged irregular expenditure -- worth billions of rand -- and lists a number of companies believed to be working in cahoots with the airline.According to the organisations treasurer Gift Bilankulu, irregular expenditure at SAA amounts to R1,886-billion.Sibanyoni-Mugambi said the association has exhausted all options at its disposal to get the matter heard.READ: SAA offers to assist passengers for free after strike action We have written to the ex-minister of finance, we have written the board countless letters, we have written the new financial minister, and to date no one is addressing our issues. The union says it is concerned the alleged corruption is threatenening their jobs and it will be laying charges.READ: SAA gets interdict against striking cabin crew We are going to the police to lay charges so that they can prove us right or wrong. If we are wrong, the investigators will say SACCA was incorrect, said Sibanyoni-Mugambi.SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said the airline doesn't condone criminality, but warned that the law must be allowed to take its course."Everyone mentioned in the document is innocent until proven otherwise," he said.Tlalil said he hopes the union's accusations are based on hard evidence, and not aimed at tarnishing reputations of individuals.eNCA

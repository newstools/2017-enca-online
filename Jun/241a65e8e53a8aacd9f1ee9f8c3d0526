SYDNEY - Hollywood actor Rebel Wilson on Thursday won a lengthy defamation case against an Australian publisher that portrayed her as a serial liar, which she said cost her lucrative movie roles.The 37-year-old "Pitch Perfect" star sued Bauer Media over eight articles in Woman's Day, Australian Women's Weekly and OK Magazine in 2015, which her defence said "tore down an Australian star to sell magazines".The stories claimed the Sydney-born actor lied about her name, age and background in order to advance her career in the United States.Giving evidence during the three-week trial, often in tears, Wilson claimed she was sacked from DreamWorks animated feature films "Trolls" and "Kung Fu Panda 3" following the articles.Bauer denied they damaged her reputation and argued they were true.But the Victorian Supreme Court ruled she was defamed in all eight of the pieces, with the judge to decide on the penalty at a later date."Bauer Media took me down with a series of grubby and completely false articles," said Wilson outside the court."Far too often I feel the tabloid magazines and the journalists that work for them don't abide by professional ethics."Far too often I can only describe their conduct as disgusting and disgraceful and I'm very glad that the jury has agreed with me. And with the unanimous and overwhelming verdict they have sent a very clear message."Wilson, who will now jet to New York to shoot a film with fellow Australian Liam Hemsworth, said she was grateful the drama was now over."It's a win for everyone who gets maliciously taken down when there's no reason why that should happen," she said.

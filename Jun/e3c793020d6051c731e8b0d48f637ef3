JOHANNESBURG - "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes," or so the saying by Benjamin Franklin goes. There are few, if any, who are pleased to have money deducted from their salaries each month, to go into the coffers of the state. With the economy in recession, South Africans will be even harder pressed to want to part with their hard-earned cash. A new tool developed by Code for South Africa, called a Tax Clock, shows you how much of your working day is actually being spent in service of government. Someone who earns an annual salary of R200,000, and works from 9am to 5pm, will spend the first one hour and 47 minutes "working for" the state.

For the R200k earner, 11 minutes are spent on working off national debt, 16 minutes on basic education and 13 minutes on health. The Tax Clock, therefore, helps to show taxpayers how they help to drive positive social change in the country. WATCH: Does government pay tax?Adi Eyal, Director of Code for South Africa, says the Tax Clock is an opportunity for people to engage with the budget through the money they earn - and the tax they pay."When the budget comes out, people are usually only interested in how much they will be paying and if there are any rebates they can get. But they don't engage with what the budget is really about," he explains.Want to know how much of your working day belongs to government? Calculate your own tax clock below: eNCA

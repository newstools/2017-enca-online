UNITED KINGDOM - Leg-spinner Imran Tahir took four wickets as South Africa beat Sri Lanka by 96 runs to begin their Champions Trophy campaign in style in London on Saturday.Defeat came with an added sting for Sri Lanka who were later found guilty of a slow over-rate offence by the ICC with their captain Upul Tharanga banned for their next two matches, and players fined. #CT17 - RESULT: A winning start for the Proteas as they beat Sri Lanka by 96 runs. Tahir was the star with the ball https://t.co/T1S106wPeT pic.twitter.com/mNZU2OcNVATahir finished with four for 27 in 8.3 overs after former captain Hashim Amla scored his 25th ODI century to set Sri Lanka a target of 300 runs.Sri Lanka were cruising along at 116 for two when Tahir was introduced to the attack in the 18th over and South Africa immediately got a firm grip on the game.Dinesh Chandimal took on one of South Africa's best fielders, A.B. de Villiers, on a misfield and was run out by a direct hit.Three deliveries later, Chamara Kapugedera was foxed by a Tahir googly and was out leg before wicket without scoring.Tharanga, captain for the day after Angelo Mathews failed a late fitness test on a calf muscle injury, too fell for the googly when he hit one straight to the deep cover fielder.He top scored with 57 runs. Sri Lanka skipper Upul Tharanga has been suspended for 2 matches for a slow over rate in their #CT17 loss to South Africa. #SSCricketSri Lanka never recovered after that and were shot out for 203 runs with still 8.3 overs remaining.The ICC then took decisive action over the slow over-rate after the Sri Lankans took four hours and seven minutes to finish their overs during the South African innings.ICC rules stipulate that teams should finish their 50 overs within three-and-a-half hours.Opener Niroshan Dickwella had given them a blistering start smashing 41 off 33 balls.The openers added 69 runs in 50 deliveries and they were 87 for one at the end of ten overs whereas South Africa were 32 for none at the same stage.The middle order failed to capitalize after a good start and they have to win their remaining two games against India and Pakistan to have any hopes of a semi-final berth.Sri Lanka were excellent against South Africa's seamers, but the introduction of Tahir derailed their innings.Read: LIVE UPDATE: Duminy puts SA at 299/6After being put into bat in overcast conditions, Amla consolidated for South Africa with his 25th ODI hundred and the fifth against Sri Lanka.He added 145 runs with Francois du Plessis, who contributed with 75 runs off 70 deliveries with six fours.Amla was run out by a direct hit from Tharanga for a fine 103 that came off 115 deliveries with five fours and two sixes.

JOHANNESBURG - Cricket SA named the Proteas squad for the three-match T20 International Series in England to be played immediately after the conclusion of the ICC Champions Trophy Tournament in June. AB de Villiers will captain the side in the absence of regular T20 captain Faf du Plessis who is being rested. I would like to thank Farhaan Behardien for leading the side so ably in the recent series against Sri Lanka, said CSA National Selection Panel convener, Linda Zondi. We are indeed fortunate in the quality of our team leaders and Farhaan remains very much part of this group.READ: Proteas must fall back on winning blueprint McKenzie We have also been impressed as a panel by the quality of players coming through our franchise and South Africa A system and we are ready to give further opportunities to Andile Phehlukwayo, Mangaliso Mosehle, Jon-Jon Smuts and Dane Paterson who all made their debuts in the recent series against Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, Lungi Ngidi could not be considered because of injury. This is an exciting opportunity for the newcomers to play alongside world-class and experienced players like AB, Farhaan, David Miller, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris and Wayne Parnell. There is one new cap in this format in Dwaine Pretorius, who has been a regular member of the ODI squad during the past season.READ: SABC fail in bid to secure rights to Proteas England tourProteas T20 International Squad: AB de Villiers (Cpt) Farhaan Behardien Reeza Hendricks Imran Tahir David Miller Morne Morkel Chris Morris Mangaliso Mosehle Wayne Parnell Dane Paterson Andile Phehlukwayo Dwaine Pretorius Tabraiz Shamsi Jon-Jon Smuts African News Agency

He scored two tries for the SA A team and featured on the programme cover - it's @lwazimvovo #LoveRugby @MMStadium pic.twitter.com/9oOrmbr4yJ But the tourists faded in the closing stages and centre Harold Vorster and full-back Mvovo scored tries converted by fly-half Lionel Cronje and his replacement, Fred Zeilinga.Mvovo (2), winger Makazole Mapimpi, loose forward Sikhumbuzo Notshe and Vorster (2) were the South African try scorers with Cronje kicking two conversions and Zeilinga one.Scrum-half Yann Lesgourgues, Michalak and Belleau (2) scored tries for the Barbarians, all of which Michalak converted.The teams meet again next Friday at another football ground, Orlando Stadium in Soweto.AFP

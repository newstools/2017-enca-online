WELLINGTON - Anthony Watson's 52nd minute try gave the British and Irish Lions the slim advantage they needed for a scrappy 13-7 victory over the Provincial Barbarians in the opening match of their tour in Whangarei on Saturday.Playing the of their 10 matches only four days after arriving, the tourists never really got on a roll against a committed Barbarians team who gave them a reminder of the depth of quality in the New Zealand game.Lions flyhalf Johnny Sexton slotted a first half penalty, scrumhalf Greig Laidlaw then stepped up when he went down injured to add a second, and replacement flyhalf Owen Farrell converted Watson's try.Captain Sam Anderson-Heather scored the only try for the Barbarians and suffered injuries to his knee, ribs and hand before he was replaced at halftime.Flyhalf Bryn Gatland, the son of Lions coach Warren, converted Anderson-Heather's try and showed he would be more than capable of playing at a higher level should the Auckland Blues need him on Wednesday against the tourists.More than 30 hours of non-stop rain had swamped the region, but the match was played in relatively dry but slippery conditions in front of a sell-out crowd of 19,951.The Lions had been expected to withstand an early onslaught before grinding down the side composed of players from New Zealand's semi-professional provincial competition.Despite the fact Gatland had chosen the side before they left Britain and they spent a week training together, the Lions lacked cohesion and timing.The Barbarians also demonstrated what the once in a liftime occasion meant to them, gang-tackling their opponents and throwing the ball around in typical Barbarians styleThe Lions took the direct route smashing into tacklers, but once they realised the Barbarians were solid defensively, they began to seek space and keep the ball alive.The pressure began to pay dividends as the game wore on and they were held up over the line on several occasions, with the final attempt before half-time resulting in a massive roar from the crowd as the Barbarians went into the break with a 7-3 lead.That momentum continued in the second half as the Lions stepped up their defensive effort and kept pressure on the home side, with a superb driving tackle by Alun Wyn Jones setting up the field position that led to Watson's try.Reuters

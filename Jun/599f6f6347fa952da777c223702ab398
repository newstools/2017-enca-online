LONDON Pakistan have surprised many to reach the final of CT17, a tournament it very nearly failed to qualify for.The men in green came into the ICC Champions Trophy as the lowest-ranked of all eight teams and started the tournament with an error-strewn performance against India, sliding to a 124-run defeat.Wayward with the ball, sloppy with the bat and calamitous in the field; Sarfraz Ahmed s side looked like anything but a team that would share the final stage with the defending champions.In some ways, Pakistan were fortunate to be involved in the competition at all. On 3 October 2015, the team suffered a shock defeat to Zimbabwe in Harare and slipped to ninth in the ICC ODI Rankings, just four days after the cut-off date to qualify for CT17 as one of the top eight sides in the world.It was the narrowest of escapes and a defining moment in the journey the team has been on since.READ: Pakistan stun South Africa in Champions TrophyPakistan s line-up has changed significantly since that loss, with only four of the XI that faced Zimbabwe selected for the ICC Champions Trophy, namely Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik and Sarfraz Ahmed. Crucially, there has been a change of captain, too, with the energetic keeper-batsman Sarfraz replacing Azhar in February 2017.Pakistan have made a habit of thriving in adversity over the years and Sarfraz said he had never lost faith, despite the heavy defeat to India. If we play good cricket, definitely we will win this tournament, he told his players. His confidence now seems justified.South Africa, ranked number one in the ICC ODI Rankings, was the first victim of a resurgent Pakistan, as Hasan Ali s three-wicket haul inspired a morale-boosting victory in a rain-affected contest at Edgbaston.

You wouldn t want to write them off. African News Agency

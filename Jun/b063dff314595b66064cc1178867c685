JOHANNESBURG - The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) members at Gauteng s Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA), responsible for managing the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto), on Monday downed tools over work hours, the trade union said.The employees included adjudicators, call centre agents, revenue service staff, administrators and general workers. The trouble started when workers noticed a discrepancy in the stipulated hours of work in their letter of appointment as opposed to what was stated in the original Conditions of Service Policy."The policy stated 40 hours of work per week, including lunch and tea breaks, while the letter of appointment put total hours of work at 45 hours per week, the union said.According to the union, further talks with management on the work hours yielded no success.The matter was then referred to the Commission of Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), a certificate of non-resolution was issued, granting Satwu permission to embark on a strike. Our members at RTIA are adamant they will remain on strike until their voices are heard."However, it is important to say that we are still open to negotiations and invite management to come to the table so as to avoid service to motorists being interrupted, said Satawu.African News Agency

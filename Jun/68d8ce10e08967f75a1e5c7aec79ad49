Bad news from Derby, rain pouring steadily and doesn't look to be abating anytime soon. #SAvNZ #wwc17 #ProteasWomen pic.twitter.com/30X52G18GwThe teams shared the points, taking New Zealand to the top of the tournament log with South Africa coming in second place. Both sides come off victories against Pakistan and Sri Lanka and while New Zealand s was a convincing, nine-wicket affair thanks to captain, Suzie Bates unbeaten 106 in their 189-run chase, South Africa s was a thriller that ended with no. 9 batter, Shabnim Ismail (22 off 16 balls) winning the match for her team with an over to spare after a middle order collapse. Proteas captain, Dan van Niekerk felt the frustration of the day, spending it waiting for the team to hear word on whether they will get game time or not, but she is looking forward to her team s next assignment against the West Indies this Sunday. She said; It s been quite frustrating watching the rain all day, sitting in the changeroom and trying to stay busy but also mentally switched on in case we re told we can go on, but we re looking forward to the game against the West Indies. You don t come to a tournament like this to share points, but then again we have to move on and look forward, we have a lot of games that still need to be played and we have to be ready tomorrow for our training ahead of Sunday s match.

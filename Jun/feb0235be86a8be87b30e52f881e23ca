CAPE TOWN - The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) revealed on Wednesday that they have evidence that President Jacob Zuma is involved in state capture. They released a document titled No a Room to Hide: A president caught in the act. The organisation's Ben Theron said they plan to present the document to Parliament, bolstering their case to have President Zuma removed. Some of the allegations include Zuma's relationship and links to the Gupta family. "The document is essential reading for MPs who are expected to participate in the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma," read a statement. !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's steel production fell by 3.5 percent on year in May to 561 000 tons according to the World Steel Association.Steel production is an important indicator of economic health so the fall of only 0.8 percent in the first five months of 2017 after a 4.2 percent drop last year is good news. It means overall economic growth should be above last year s 0.3 percent increase. South Africa, however, lags global growth as global steel production increased by 4.7 percent in first five months of the year.The recovery in steel production indicates that the increase in global economic growth forecasts for 2017 by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have substance based on evidence such as the highest annual growth in world trade volumes since April 2011 being recorded in March 2017.Steel demand in the emerging and developing economies excluding China which accounts for 30 percent of the world total is expected to grow by 4 percent in 2017 according to the World Steel Association forecasts. It is then expected to increase by a further 4.9% in 2018 which should benefit the South African steel and iron ore industry.Bulk exports out of Saldanha which are mostly iron ore jumped by 24.2 percent the first quarter of 2017 to 17.4-million tons. In May Chinese steel production grew by 1.8 percent to 72.8-million tons. iNet Bridge

As issues stand, we have it on good authority that about 60 percent of the more than 700 delegates that were registered yesterday [Wednesday] do not have ascertainable bona fides as MK military veterans," the four said in a joint statement on Thursday."Given that a huge number of those veterans who have aligned themselves with the MK national council do not also have any form of representation in the forthcoming MKMVA conference, we hold that it would be incorrect for this conference to be viewed as a constitutional gathering of MKMVA with the powers to elect a new leadership, they said. -- Additional reporting: African News Agency Tweets about #MKMVA AND (FROM:@ThulasSims since:2017-06-09 until:2017-06-10)eNCA

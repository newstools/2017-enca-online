This is a normal recall. It is part of the routine changes when the period of deployment has elapsed, said Makol.Meanwhile, in another related development, three American former soldiers with questionable histories, were deported from South Sudan on Tuesday after they were found to not be in possession of the legal document allowing them to enter the country. We received comprehensive reports from local authorities in Kapoeta State, the Immigration and the Military Intelligence of Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA), that on June 20, three Americans attempted to enter the country without proper documents, said police spokesman Brigadier Daniel Justin. Their visas had not been approved, they were not tourists nor investment agents. They stayed for three days in Narus until they were returned to Kenya. This is the only information we have received, added Justin.The Americans were subsequently returned to Kenya on 22 June. Kenya was their point of entry, so they were asked to return to Kenya and they went. If they come back with legal documents, they would be welcomed, said the police spokesperson.The three Americans were identified as Alex Jared Zweifelholfer, Craig Austin Lang and William Wright-Martinovich.Zweifelholfer, is a 21-year-old Private First Class of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team and the 82nd Airborne Division. He is reportedly wanted in America since October 2016 for deserting his unit. Media reports also claim his social media posts indicate his participation in the Ukrainian civil war, the Tribune reported.Lang, a 27-year-old former US Army soldier, reportedly drove from his base in Fort Bliss, Texas, non-stop to North Carolina two years ago, with a car loaded with claymore mines and two M4 rifles after his partner allegedly sent him various videos of relations with other men.Lang had driven to North Carolina in an attempt to mine the perimeter of the house in which his wife was living with claymores in an attempt to murder her.The former soldier later went to the Ukraine and participated in the civil war, although it is unknown which side of the war he fought on.Little is known about Martinovich, a former US Marine, who is also thought to have left the army to participate in the Ukrainian civil war.AFP

JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng taxi operators affiliated to the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) on Wednesday advised commuters to arrange alternative transport for Thursday due to a massive march against what it called high minibus taxi purchase costs. No taxis will be running. We advise commuters to seek alternative transport. We apologise for any inconvenience that will be caused by this, Santaco spokesman Ralph Jones said on Wednesday. The industry members will hand over a memorandum of grievances to the directors of SA Taxi Finance company. Some members have been hard hit by high interest rate of 28 percent [on vehicle finance] and blacklisting due to [required] repayments of R15,000 per month over 72 months we can t take it anymore.

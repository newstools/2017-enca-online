PERTH Defending champions Wellington Hurricanes set a new Super Rugby try-scoring record in overcoming Western Force 34-12 in Perth on Saturday.The Hurricanes posted six tries to two to break the record for most tries in a Super Rugby season, with 83 overtaking South Africa's Golden Lions' 81 from last season.Wellington moved 10 points behind the Canterbury Crusaders in the New Zealand conference with two games left in the regular season, one of them against the Crusaders at home.The Hurricanes' victory also further extended New Zealand's winning record over Australian opposition this season to 23-0. The champions' potent attacking big guns, TJ Perenara, Beauden Barrett, Vince Aso and Ngani Laumape, were constantly in the play, with Laumape and Aso taking their season tally to 14 tries each.The Hurricanes led 12-0 at half-time, but the gutsy Force clawed back to trail 12-7 and had the Kiwi heavyweights under defensive pressure for much of the second half.Wellington got away from the Force with four tries in 17 minutes to close out a strong win.READ: Hurricanes run in seven tries for a 41-22 win over Stormers"They asked a lot of questions for most of the game, we had a good run in the final quarter, but for the majority of the game we were camped at our end of the field and they were putting us under the pump," Hurricanes skipper Perenara said."It took a big effort from our boys, it would have been most tackles by us this season, but that's a good Force team, they've got a lot to play for."

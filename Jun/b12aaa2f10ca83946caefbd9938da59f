BAMAKO, Mali - French President Emmanuel Macron was due in Mali on Sunday to consolidate Western backing for a regional anti-jihadist force, as France beefed up its counter-terror operations in the area.The so-called "G5 Sahel" countries just south of the Sahara - Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - pledged to fight jihadists on their own soil, with instability and Islamist attacks on the rise.Based in Mali, the 5,000-strong G5 Sahel force was designed to bolster the 12,000 UN peacekeepers and France's own 4,000-strong military operation, known as Barkhane, operating in the region.Macron would attend a summit on July 2 with the leaders of the African nations involved, "marking a new step" as the force was formally launched, a source in the French presidency said on Thursday.Operations across Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, all hit with frequent jihadist attacks, would be co-ordinated with French troops, the source said, while help would be given to set up command centres.The new force would support national armies trying to catch jihadists across porous frontiers.WATCH: McGown family told Stephen is 'alive and well' in MaliMacron visited Gao in northern Mali in May, his first foreign visit as president outside Europe, and said French troops would remain "until the day there is no more Islamic terrorism in the region."France launched an intervention to chase out jihadists linked to Al-Qaeda who had overtaken key northern cities in Mali in 2013.That mission evolved into the current Barkhane deployment launched in 2014, with an expanded mandate for counter-terror operations across the Sahel.International support?Macron was hoping that the 50-million (R743-million) the European Union had pledged to the Sahel force would be supplemented by extra support from Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United States, which already had a drone base in Niger.The French president would specify the final details of his nation's support on Sunday, but the focus was expected to be on help with equipment.The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that welcomed the G5 Sahel deployment, but did not grant it UN authorisation, and France was forced to drop a request for a special UN report on financing for the force.READ: Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists claim responsibility for Mali resort attackThe question of funding was sensitive as Chad's leader Idriss Deby said his troops could not serve simultaneously at such high numbers in the UN peacekeeping mission and also in the new force, due to budgetary reasons.Deby and Macron were due to meet on the margins of the Bamako summit to discuss the issue, according the French presidency, as Chad's military was widely viewed as the strongest of the five Sahel nations.African Union President Alpha Conde underlined Wednesday that the continent must "take responsibility for the fight against terrorism," echoing the views of Macron's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.Macron was keen on his last visit to Mali to promote economic development rather than military might, with hopes that improving the situation of young people would dim the allure of joining jihadist groups.Conflict in the area was also driven by land disputes, the lack of a functioning state in some areas and poor governance where it was operative, experts say.

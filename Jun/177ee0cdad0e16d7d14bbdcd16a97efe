JOHANNESBURG - The ANC says Helen Zille must immediately step down as Western Cape premier following her suspension from the Democratic Alliance. "She Is not good enough for the DA and is also not good enough for the Western Cape province," the ANC in that province said on Saturday after the DA announcement. Zille is barred from party events pending the outcome of disciplinary processes related to controversial tweets she made defending colonialism. But she remains the provincial premier. The ANC said: "It is clear the DA does not have the political will to deal properly with its past leader Zille by recalling her from her government position." Maimane says #Zille continued to damage party with various pieces of communication that undermined what the DA is trying to achieve #DAFedEx pic.twitter.com/EGY0dCY2nR The "embarrassed Zille must now resign as premier, too", the ANC said.

Political leadership is about tough choices and in my view @MmusiMaimane made the right one on a Helen Zille Others weighed in Constitutionally, it is easy to remove Premier Zille from office. Can instruct DA MPs to support vote of no confidence & it is done. S 141.

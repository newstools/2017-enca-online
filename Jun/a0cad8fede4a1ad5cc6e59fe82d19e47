I will cherish this award and this evening," Grossman said after receiving the prize at a ceremony in central London."I thank first of all my wonderful, devoted, translator, Jessica Cohen," the 63-year-old author added.Judge Nick Barley said Grossman "attempted an ambitious high-wire act of a novel, and... pulled it off spectacularly""We were bowled over by Grossman s willingness to take emotional as well as stylistic risks: every sentence counts, every word matters in this supreme example of the writer's craft," Barley added.Since he started writing in the late 1970s after being fired from public radio following anger over his critical coverage, Grossman has won numerous Israeli and international awards.His 1986 novel "See Under: Love" is seen by a number of critics as his masterpiece, delving into the Holocaust and the generation of Jews that followed.

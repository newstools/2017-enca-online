WATCH: Eskom in ParliamentHis return to the power utility after a short stint as an ANC MP was met with howls of condemnation.Molefe left Eskom under a cloud last year after he was implicated in the former Public Protector s State of Capture report.When Molefe left Eskom for the first time, his proposed R30-million settlement was met with disbelief.While the board insists it's done exceptionally well, many South Africans are yet to be convinced, many will be watching the process of appointing Molefe's successor closely.eNCA

As incoming chairman, I look forward to engaging with shareholders and other stakeholders over the coming weeks to understand their perspectives, MacKenzie said.The world s biggest mining company announced last month that it was busy with further cost reductions and implementing technology programmes to improve safety and unlock resources, in a bid to grow value and improve returns.As part of these plans, BHP Billiton was rebranding itself by changing its name back to just BHP, though the rebranding would not immediately include plans to formally change its listed name.Since 2015, BHP suffered significant financial and reputational damage, after the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil at one of its joint ventures killed 19 people, destroyed 200 houses, and caused severe environmental damage.African News Agency

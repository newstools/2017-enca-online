MORULENG, South Africa - Yahya Ramadhani scored twice during the first half to give Tanzania a 2-0 victory over Malawi Sunday in the opening match of the COSAFA Cup southern Africa championship.An early goal from Augusto "Manguxi" Quibeto earned Angola a 1-0 win against Mauritius in a fiery second match of a double-header at Moruleng Stadium in northwestern South Africa.Unmarked Ramadhani opened the scoring 13 minutes into the Group A match with a close-range half-volley after a deep cross eluded Malawian defenders.His second goal was a solo effort as he brought the ball to the edge of the box before unleashing a low shot that flew across goalkeeper Ernest Kankhobwe into the far corner.Khuda Muyaba wasted a great chance to score for Malawi later in the half when he blazed over after pouncing on a weak clearance from goalkeeper Aishi Manula.Malawi dominated possession during the second half, but it was Tanzania who came closest to scoring through a long-range shot that rattled the crossbar."We used our speed to create plenty of first-half chances and were content to sit back after half-time and soak up the pressure," said Tanzania coach Salum Mayanga.Tanzania are members of East African body CECAFA, but were invited as "guests" when COSAFA affiliate the Comoros islands declined to compete in the annual tournament.Belgium-born Malawi coach Ronny van Geneugden was angry with the first-half performance of his team as he suffered a third loss in five matches since taking charge this year."We competed only in the second half and did well, apart from not scoring. In the first half we showed Tanzania far too much respect and lacked confidence."A snap shot by Quibeto after only four minutes separated Angola and Mauritius in a match of many rash tackles, particularly from the Indian Ocean islanders.Numerous Mauritians were cautioned, but the only red card went to Angola goalkeepers coach Antonio Suarez, who was sent to the stand for verbally abusing the match officials."Mauritius had no respect for the laws of football," fumed Brazil-born Angola coach Roberto Bianchi.Group B kicks off Monday at the same venue with a fixture between Mozambique and Zimbabwe, followed by Madagascar against the Seychelles.The group winners advance to the quarter-finals where they will join title-holders South Africa, 2016 runners-up Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland and Zambia.

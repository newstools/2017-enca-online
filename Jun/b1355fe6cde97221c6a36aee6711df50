JOHANNESBURG Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was very concerned about the "alarming number" of pregnant pupils in the province.The Gauteng Education Department said 4,446 pupils school girls fell pregnant in the past year.Lesufi called the situation demoralising, but said his department would not throw in the towel. Our mission within the education space is to take these children out of poverty and if we have over 4,400 (pregnant pupils) already it means we are recycling poverty instead of defeating it, Lesufi said. It is disgusting... but we have to confront it and that is what we are doing now.

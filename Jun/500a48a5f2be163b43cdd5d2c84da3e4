MONTREAL - Canadian champion Adonis Stevenson stopped challenger Andrzej Fonfara 28 seconds into the second round to retain his World Boxing Council world title on Saturday."I was very focused on him. I took my time and finished the job," said Stevenson.The 39-year-old easily won the rematch between the two light heavyweights as Poland's Fonfara barely survived the opening round at the Bell Centre Arena in Montreal.Fonfara's trainer Virgil Hunter stepped in and stopped the fight early in the second round because his boxer was taking too much punishment."I caught him with my left. I knew he was coming so I took the punch," said Stevenson.When Fonfara returned to his stool after the first round, he looked dazed and out of it."He was hurt in first round," Hunter said. "He survived but when he came back to the corner, he wasn't all the way there."I told him 'In the second round, don't even throw a punch, just get yourself back.' He got caught with a punch."It was a rematch of their action-packed meeting in 2014, when Fonfara sent Stevenson to the canvas but was knocked down twice himself as Stevenson won by scores of 115-110, 115-110 and 116-109.On Saturday, Fonfara was the first to hit the canvas in the opening round. Stevenson hurt him with a hard left to the temple, which was followed quickly by the knockdown.Later in the round, a helpless Fonfara had to be saved by the bell after Stevenson trapped him in the corner and was landing punches at will.The 39-year-old champion now boasts a record of 29-1 with 24 knockouts.Fonfara, who falls to 29-5 with 17 knockouts, was seeking a first world title.Fonfara, who lives in Chicago, said he will recover from this beating."He showed me tonight that he is the champ. I have to train and come back harder," he said.Stevenson has been talking about unifying the division, saying previously he might fight the winner of the upcoming bout between Sergey Kovalev and Andre Ward.AFP

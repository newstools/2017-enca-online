CAPE TOWN, – Despite several days of heavy rainfall, dams supplying the Cape Peninsula have swelled by a mere 1.5 percent, the City of Cape Town said on Monday. The City’s mayoral committee member for water, Xanthea Limberg, told eNCA the dam levels now stood at 21.2 percent, with only 11.2 percent of the water being usable. “There has been an increase in water levels within our dams but this does not mean we are out of the critical situation,” said Limberg.

Limberg said the City would start tapping into the Table Mountain aquifer by the end of July this year. The aquifer was expected to yield between two and five million litres of water a day. She said plans to drill down into the Cape Flats aquifer was also on track. This was expected to yield between three and five million litres of water a day.

She said the City has set aside R315 million to fund the additional supply schemes this financial year with additional funding to be prioritised in the following years to “allow us to implement all supply schemes”. “We need to diversify our water mix and not only rely on surface water.” African News Agency

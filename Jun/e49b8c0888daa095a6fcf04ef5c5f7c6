Pakistan actually started well, we had to ride that out a bit, play our shots and enjoy ourselves."Knight struck 12 fours and two sixes in a 109-ball 106, while Sciver slapped 14 fours and four sixes in a whirlwind 92-ball 137.There was also an entertaining 50-run partnership between Danielle Wyatt (42 not out) and Fran Wilson (33).The form of Ayesha was a rare positive for Pakistan as the opener brought up her half-century off 67 balls.It was a second defeat in as many outings for Pakistan and captain Sana Mir said: "We disappointed a lot of fans today. In the first game, we were not able to play the standard we set ourselves and we did not reach those standards again."The only match on Wednesday sees New Zealand take on South Africa in Derby. All the eight teams involved will play each other once, with the top four contesting the semi-finals.The final takes place at Lord's on July 23.AFP

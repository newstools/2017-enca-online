JOHANNESBURG - Jan Serfontein and Lionel Mapoe are set to form a new-look centre combination in the Springboks second Test against France in Durban on Saturday.Coach Allister Coetzee is expected to maintain continuity in selection after last Saturday s encouraging 37-14 win over France at Loftus, but he will be forced into making at least one change.READ: Kriel out of second Bok Test against FranceIn an unfortunate blow for the Boks, Kriel who produced an impressive performance in the opening Test has been ruled out with a concussion he sustained after a heavy collision with opposite number Henry Chavancy.Coetzee is hoping that Kriel will be fit for the final Test in Johannesburg, but he will need to relook at his midfield options this week, and the good news is that Mapoe has now fully recovered from a hamstring strain.One option for Coetzee could have been to bring Frans Steyn off the bench to start at inside centre, while shifting Serfontein to 13, but at a press conference in Durban on Monday, the Bok coach said that he is not keen to move the latter out of his preferred position.Coetzee: A step in the right direction I thought that Jan played particularly well against France in Pretoria and I would prefer not to move him, Coetzee commented. He is a specialist (inside) centre and I would prefer to select a specialist if I can. It is preferable to selecting someone from the bench as that would mean making a double change, and that is not necessary at this point. So I will go with someone who is a specialist outside centre to play with Jan, which means Lionel or someone like that. READ: Boks celebrate win over FranceIt s worth bearing in mind that Mapoe is the only specialist outside centre in the squad, with Francois Venter and Juan de Jongh currently on duty with the South Africa A team, who will face the French Barbarians on Friday.Meanwhile, Coetzee also confirmed that Damian de Allende will now be returning to the Stormers in order to complete his recovery from a quad contusion.It was hoped that De Allende might have a role to play in the June series, but with the injury showing no immediate sign of clearing up, the inside centre will need to prove his fitness once Super Rugby resumes in July.AFP

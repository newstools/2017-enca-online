JOHANNESBURG - The newly-appointed Director General of the Treasury said South Africa needed all hands on deck, to get out of its financial difficulties.Dondo Mogajane was addressing a Youth Economic Indaba in Johannesburg on Saturday night."My appointment as DG of Treasury brought with it a recession, because the same day I was appointed is when officially we were in a recession," Mogojane told the crowd."Investors want to know what we have in store to ensure that we go back to an investment grade and get out of the recession," he added."We have a story, but our story is not complete."We did engage with the president last week, and a few economy ministers."We have options that we have put in place and we'll be finalising these options."The DG said Treasury spent the past few weeks engaging with all stakeholders on the economy, including President Jacob Zuma.One priority was tackling the scourge of unemployment which was hitting the economy hard.He was confident these marathon sessions would soon bear fruit.READ: Business confidence falls to worst level since 2008/09 recessionOnce the plans were finalised, they would be presented to the president on Wednesday.Mogajane believed this would bring much-needed clarity to what he called an economic mess."We're now approaching a 55% debt to GDP ratio; it's unsustainable," he said."The challenge now is how do we bring it down, how do we bring our budget deficit down, how do we ensure that we grow the economy, and build the cake?"When there is growth, it amounts to corporate individuals paying more taxes; more tax means we have more tax revenue to spend."And then we can stretch the rand in the best way possible."Mogajane said it was time to use fiscal policy to ensure inclusive growth."We have to look at township economies, and township development in a different light completely, in a radical way.READ: The markets can stomach a captured Treasury but SA's poor will suffer"How do we radically transform township economies so that they are inclusive, to ensure they address youth unemployment, and social ills in our societies?"For me it's not about the term, whether you call it inclusive growth or radical economic transformation, it's about what you want to achieve in the end."Mogajane insisted Treasury was apolitical."The nice thing about us is that we're all professionals," he said."We are professionals and we can work under any political administration, and we have proven that."Who the minister is, for us at Treasury that's not an issue."Mogajane was appointed Director General of national Treasury in a permanent capacity earlier this month.He had been the acting Director General since May, following the resignation of Lungisa Fuzile after the Cabinet reshuffle, which saw the removal of Pravin Gordhan as Finance Minister.Mogajane worked for the Finance Department since 1999 and was most recently the deputy Director General responsible for public finance.eNCA

VERNASCA, Italy - Soaring temperatures and a lack of rainfall across Italy cost farmers 1-billion (over R14-billion) so far this year, the country's national agricultural association said on Friday.Water levels in rivers and lakes sunk to levels never before seen this early in the summer, including the River Po that shrunk to a tiny stream in some places.The government declared a state of emergency in the gastronomic heartland around the northern cities of Parma and Piacenza, a usually lush valley that produced tomatoes, cheese, and high-quality ham.READ: Climate change rift raises temperature for G7 meetWine grapes growing near Venice would be harvested early, mozzarella makers near Naples had been thrown into crisis, and Sardinian shepherds took tractors onto main roads to call for help to save their livelihoods, according to Europe's largest agricultural professional organisation, the Coldiretti group.The group's chairman, Roberto Moncalvo, said the climate was becoming "tropical"."If we want to maintain high quality in agriculture we need to organise ourselves to collect water during rainy periods, doing structural work that cannot be put off any longer," Moncalvo said.

WASHINGTON, United States -Â US President Donald Trump said Thursday he did not have recordings of his meetings with former FBI director James Comey, after weeks of speculations that the Republican billionaire leader himself fueled.

"With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings," Trump said on Twitter. With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea... ...whether there are "tapes" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.

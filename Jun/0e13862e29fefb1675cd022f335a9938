JOHANNESBURG - The ANC lashed out at the Black Land First (BLF) group, which threatened and tried to intimidate editor of Tiso Blackstar Group (formerly Times Media) Peter Bruce, during a protest outside his home on Thursday. Bruce believed the protest was due to an opinion piece he published in Business Day, in which he revealed details of harassment he suffered for writing critical articles about the controversial Gupta family.It followed more revelations contained in the #Guptaleaks emails, that Bruce had been spied on.Bruce said a site called wmcleaks.com (WMC = White Monopoly Capital) invented a story about him cheating on his wife, accompanied by pictures of the surveillance, his address and ID numbers, and his children s identities.WATCH: BLF member vows to continue defending GuptasTwo other journalists, Karima Brown and Tim Cohen, who were outside Bruce's house yesterday to support him, were also manhandled. In a statement issued on Friday morning, the ANC said the BLF's manner of handling ideological differences was "an antithesis to the tolerant society appreciative of divergent views we seek to build." "The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa guarantees every person in the country the right to freedom of expression, which includes the freedom of the press and other media as well as the freedom to receive and impart information or ideas," the ANC said.WATCH: SA editor's forum responds to harassment of journalists"In the same vein, it is the view of the ANC that where the media sees any wrong doing done by government, by the ANC or any other political party let them speak out."In instances of hypocrisy, inconsistency or utter dishonesty on the part of the ANC or government or any other political party let them shout louder."The ANC called on law enforcement agencies to investigate the matter and not to hesitate to act.eNCA

NAIROBI, Kenya - Tanzanian weekly newspaper Mawio has been ordered to suspend publication for two years after pointing fingers at two former presidents in connection with huge revenue losses, the country's interior ministry said on Friday.The weekly, regularly critical of the government, was suspended after it published front-page pictures of former presidents Jakaya Kikwete (2005-2015) and Benjamin Mkapa (1995-2005) on Thursday, linking them with dubious mining contracts. #Tanzania govt should lift the ban on #MAWIO. Such draconian measures against free media must stop. It's 21st century for God's sake! pic.twitter.com/29tHtZs7hJOn Wednesday, President John Magufuli had threatened "severe measures" against any media that suggested Kikwete and Mkapa might be involved in signing contracts that were disadvantageous to the state.READ: Tanzania says 19 years of mining fraud cost it $84bnJustice Minister Palamagamba Kabudi pointed out that the former heads of state enjoyed immunity from prosecution over events occurring during their mandates.Mawio went on to report comments by opposition MP Tundi Lissu, who told parliament that Kikwete and Mkapa were mainly responsible for the controversial contracts and that both should be summoned before an inquiry commission.A commission of inquiry set up by President John Magufuli on Monday estimated that 75 billion euros (R1-trillion) had been lost in tax evasion arising from mining operations since 1998.The panel found that the losses were primarily due to the failure of foreign companies operating in Africa's fourth largest gold producer to declare earnings. It blamed flawed contracts unfavourable to the state.The information ministry said that Mawio had made the accusations against the former leaders when neither of two commissions set up by Magufuli to probe the affair had blamed them for anything.The weekly was ordered to suspend publication of both its print edition and the internet edition for 24 months from the date of notification.READ: Tanzanian rapper held for 'insulting president' in songFollowing the publication of reports on the mining sector, Magufuli ordered the revision of laws on the allocation of mining contracts and asked prosecutors to question -- and even charge -- ministers of mining and of justice found to have signed contracts harmful to state interests in recent years.Magufuli accused Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold -- in a live televised address this week --of "stealing from us", but welcomed discussions when the firm's CEO John Thornton flew to Tanzania on Wednesday.Mawio has already faced a government ban for its coverage of a political crisis after elections late in December 2015 in the semi-autonomous Zanzibar islands. That ban was lifted by the courts.TAFP

SOCHI- Germany eased into the Confederations Cup semi-finals with a 3-1 win over Cameroon on Sunday as the VAR system was again thrust into the spotlight when the on-field official needed two reviews of an incident to reach the right verdict.Colombian Wilmar Roldan consulted the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) after a reckless high challenge by Ernest Mabouka on Germany's Emre Can saw Cameroon captain Sebastien Siani wrongfully receive a yellow card in a case of mistaken identity.

It was only after Cameroon s players insisted he review the incident again that he realised his error, rescinded Siani s sending-off and instead flashed the red card to the correct culprit Mabouka.

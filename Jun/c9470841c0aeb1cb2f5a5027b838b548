NEW YORK - Google would implement more measures to identify and remove terrorist or violent extremist content on its video-sharing platform YouTube, the company said in a blog post on Sunday.The tech giant was taking a tougher position on videos containing supremacist or inflammatory religious content, by issuing a warning, as well as not monetising or recommending them for user endorsements, even if the clips did not clearly violate its policies.The company would also employ more engineering resources and increase its use of technology to help identify extremist videos, in addition to training new content classifiers to quickly identify and remove such content."While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies, the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done, now," said Google's general counsel Kent Walker.

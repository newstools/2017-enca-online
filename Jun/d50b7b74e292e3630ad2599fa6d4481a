He really gives us hope," the 76-year-old Westwood, a founder of the punk movement in the 1970s, said of Corbyn, speaking shortly before her label's catwalk show at Men's Fashion Week."I do belive that it's the only party that is a strong opposition and they've got it right," she said.She called Labour's leftist manifesto "brilliant" and underlined 68-year-old Corbyn's appeal to a younger generation inspired by his firebrand politics.Read: Zany Westwood closes London Fashion Week"The main thing to realise is young people voted for him.

JOHANNESBURG Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the party is searching for information proving that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is captured. Speaking to Talk Radio 702 s Eusebius McKaiser on Friday morning, Malema said the party regrets supporting Mkhwebane s appointment. We confess that we made a terrible mistake. She misled us through her interview. She did a very good interview compared to the rest of those who were there. We thought she was someone very credible. One of the things that we have asked our security department to look into, because these emails [GuptaLeaks] are too many, we just asked them please you must never miss an email where Mkhwebane is exchanging some ideas with these people just to demonstrate that she is captured. Once we establish that, the next morning we will be the first one at the door of the court to have her removed, said Malema. The public protector's office wasn't immediately available for comment. Malema also weighed in on various subjects including alleged corruption at Transnet, the ANC and Helen Zille s disciplinary process, saying the DA is becoming another ANC. We gave the opposition an opportunity to prove themselves. They are becoming another ANC were they protect an individual more than the party. When you say you are suspending her from DA activities how is she going to participate in the party caucus? How will you give her a mandate to an extent were she says this mandate is illegal? She is supposed to engage with that mandate in the caucus and say we can t take this type of a mandate, but she will not have such an opportunity and then she will do on her on. When Zille messes up the Western Cape who do we blame? he said.The DA suspended Zille from all party activities following her controversial tweets about colonialism.The Western Cape premier is challenging this.Her disciplinary hearing will resume on 30 June.

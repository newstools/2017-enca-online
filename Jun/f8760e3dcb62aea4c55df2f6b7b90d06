JOHANNESBURG - Under-pressure South Africa coach Allister Coetzee believes he has found the keys to success after a disastrous first season in charge, but some critics remain sceptical.The diminutive 54-year-old former provincial scrum-half and Western Stormers coach says better preparations, coaching changes and a new team spirit will have a profound influence on results.The Springbok team to face France in Pretoria on Saturday.

The Springboks cannot be worse than last year."Many Springbok coaches have lost their jobs with better results than those achieved by Coetzee."After three-day training camps in Stellenbosch, Johannesburg and Plettenburg Bay, Coetzee says he is satisfied that France will confront well-prepared Springboks."You cannot just see the players a week or two before the international season kicks off and expect them to perform," he stressed.The late appointment of Coetzee last year meant there were no pre-season camps and inexperienced assistant coaches were chosen by the national rugby body, SAR.A lack of team spirit was glaringly evident with Coetzee-appointed skipper and hooker Adriaan Strauss failing to inspire a struggling side.READ: Warren Whiteley named Springbok captainAs the media set their sights almost exclusively on Coetzee, Strauss got off lightly until retiring from international rugby at the end of the horror season.Traditionally a kick-and-chase team, the Springboks sometimes switched to a more ball-in-hand approach without making any impact.New skipper Warren Whiteley, a No. 8 and key figure in the continuing Super Rugby success of the Johannesburg-based Golden Lions, is a popular public and media choice.AFP

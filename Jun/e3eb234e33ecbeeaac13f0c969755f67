ACCRA, Ghana - Agyei Douglas is a farmer who grows vegetables near Kumasi in Ghana's central Ashanti region.He used to struggle to access markets and capital.The information he needed was broadcast on the radio but often it was not specific enough to improve his yield of lettuce, spring onions, cabbage and chilli pepper.Two years ago, the 43-year-old began using Farmerline, which delivers weather updates, the latest market prices and other details to his second generation mobile phone.READ: Dredging the drains: the race to stop floods in Accra"It has helped us improve on our productions through the information we get from them, it has made things easier for us as compared to our previous system," he says.The Ghanaian tech company behind Farmerline is one of a number of start-ups in the West African country, working to bolster food security through better access to information.The initiative was established in 2012 and has so far helped connect some 200,000 farmers in 10 countries using the mobile technology.Farming industry According to 2014 Ghana government figures, almost half of the working population are involved in agriculture, and just over half of Ghana's land is used for farming.World Bank figures indicate some 80 percent of agricultural output came from small holders on family-operated farms with average landholdings of less than two hectares.A lack of more in-depth and accurate data have been seen as a stumbling block for Ghana's farmers, preventing them from better production or accessing financial loans.READ: Science has the power to boost farming in Africa.

JOHANNESBURG - Ford South Africa was recalling yet more vehicles.Thousands of Ikons and Figos were being recalled in order to replace high-pressure power-assisted steering hoses.The motoring giant said the current fittings were prone to splitting, which resulted in power steering fluid leaks.The recall was for Ford Ikon models built between August 2004 and March 2012, and Ford Figos manufactured between January 2009 and March 2012.The power steering fluid leaks could result in fumes being emitted from the engine compartment, excessive smoke and/or fire.WATCH: Ford announces Kuga recallThe carmaker called on its customers to contact their nearest dealers."Ford remains committed to delivering world-class quality vehicles to our customers and this voluntary safety recall is part of that commitment," Ford said in a statement."Should customers have any concerns or queries we encourage them to contact their nearest dealer or Ford Customer Service directly at 0860 011 022 or CRC3@ford.com."Ford made headlines earlier this year when some of its Kugas caught fire, resulting in a mass recall of some of its models.One person died and many others were injured, resulting in lawsuits.eNCA

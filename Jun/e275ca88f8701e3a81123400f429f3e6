PARLIAMENT - The much-anticipated vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, as requested by opposition parties, is to take place on Thursday 3 August. Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete, said she has given the request by the Democratic Alliance (DA), United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) due consideration and consulted with the Leader of Government Business and the Chief Whip of the Majority Party and set the date for the debate. "This will necessitate that the National Assembly sits earlier than initially planned. This decision has taken into account that some committees of the Assembly are currently undertaking oversight visits and Parliament has set aside July for constituency work." the Speaker's Office said in a statement released on Friday. However, Mbete has not yet indicated whether the vote will take place via a secret ballot, saying the matter is "receiving consideration".

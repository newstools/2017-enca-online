JOHANNESBURG - Judge Dennis Davis disagrees with the Public Protector's report into Absa.The Davis Panel of Experts investigated the matter in February 2002 and found that, while the type of assistance to Bankorp was unlawful Absa was not liable to pay the money because it paid fair value for Bankorp.Busisiwe Mkhwebane has recommended that government take legal action to recover over R1.1-billion in public funds given to Bankorp during the apartheid era.WATCH: Does the Public Protector's Absa recommendations hurt or help the economy?Davis said, "Where I have difficulty in reading the Public Protector's report, is that nobody has ever explained why we got it wrong, meaning (where) did our analysis, which was that the beneficiary of the life boat were the shareholders of Bankorp and not Absa, (go) wrong." "And you will look in vain in the Public Protector s report for an explanation as to why we got it wrong. We may have got it wrong and the Public Protector may have answers to provide, all I'm simply saying is what I've read, there is no explanation for why we got it wrong."She's utterly correct in replicating our finding that it was illegal, the difficulty is that she then would have to explain or might have explained why in fact her finding differs from us as to who the beneficiary of the life boat was." eNCA

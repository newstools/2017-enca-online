JOHANNESBURG - Political analyst Karima Brown says that in politics perception is reality, and the fact that there were fires at two different premiers’ offices on the day the African National Congress (ANC) National Policy Conference (NPC) kicked off is enough to get people talking.

She said the conference took place at a time when there is “a narrowing of the democratic space” in South Africa. Earlier in the afternoon, the Eastern Cape government moved to allay fears that the fire at that province's Bhisho office was linked to the fire earlier on Friday at the Gauteng premier’s offices in Johannesburg. Another analyst, Susan Booysen, said listening to the president’s address was a “surreal experience” as he shifted between a lengthy, prepared speech that took its cue straight from the party’s policy discussion documents, and shorter off-the cuff comments. She says “he played on the branches and played on the power of the people in the room” and did not take enough regard of the fact that political parties took their battles to the court largely when the government failed to offer alternate ways of resolving disputes.

MAKWATSHA, Democratic Republic of Congo - There is no electricity and only 500 residents in the Congolese village of Makwatsha, but a longstanding tradition by its womenfolk has turned it, almost by accident, into a star attraction for Chinese tourists.The outside walls of the huts are decorated with paintings of local life, flowers and butterflies, making "the village of the women painters" a draw also for travellers from France and Belgium."For the colour, we use only the earth," says Prosperine Mwelma (60), dressed in a bright blue and yellow wrap, holding a paint brush."We dig to find the pink colour," she says, her hands covered with the village's ochre clay soil.The murals of daily village life, painted by the women during the dry season and using only natural pigments, caught the eye of the director of the local French cultural institute when he passed through on holiday - and he decided to let the world know.Not only did he contact a local travel agency to try to put the village on the tourism map, but he also organised for some of the women to be invited to Paris in 2014 to exhibit their paintings.READ: Street artists bring colour to Israeli and Jordanian streetsFor the Paris trip the villagers painted their works onto canvas and sold eight of them for a total of $60,000 (R781,000)."On our own, we couldn't have done it," says Jean-Pierre Kabaso, chief of the village some 40 kilometres 25 miles south of Lubumbashi, the capital of Haut-Katanga province in the south-east of Democratic Republic of Congo.Now on tourist itineraries, the village's painting tradition could become an important source of income in the future, the 52-year-old chief says.When tourists come to the village on a day trip, they walk around, see the huts, discover how the villagers collect clay nearby to make the colours and are able to talk to them."There are other projects in the works, including plans for an exhibition in Washington," Kabaso says.Lone tour agencyIn Lubumbashi, the only tour operator in the region sits in the dark in his office - there is electricity here but many power cuts.Isaac Sumba Maly, who runs the Palma Okapi Tours travel agency, says he is preparing for a visit by Chinese tourists.The Chinese have been coming to the DRC in increasing numbers for business, especially to Katanga province where Lubumbashi is located, because of its mining activities.Most want to fit in a tour or buy souvenirs during their free time, boosting tourism and sales.China, together with Belgium and France, are the main sources for the trickle of tourists - about 100 each year - who venture to this remote corner of the country.To attract more travellers, the tour operator has launched a festival of painting at Makwatsha, teaming up with tourism and hotel schools and local media to showcase the women's work once a year.He is also planning a trip to China this year to negotiate a tourism contract with a private company looking to send its employees on holiday to Lubumbashi.WATCH: Understanding the situation in DRCBut it is a tough job selling tours to the DRC."The Congo has a bad image overseas due to insecurity, war," says Maly, dressed impeccably in a suit despite the heat.For the past several years, the DRC has been mired in a political crisis, which has worsened since President Joseph Kabila refused to step aside when his mandate expired in December.Elections are supposed to take place by the end of this year.And in several regions, armed militias battle against government troops, creating a plague of violence that makes foreign visitors fearful of venturing into the huge central African nation.AFP

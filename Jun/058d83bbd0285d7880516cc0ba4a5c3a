BRUSSELS The European Union hit Google with a record 2.4-billion-euro (R35-billion) anti-trust fine on Tuesday for favouring its own shopping service.>Hard-charging European Commission competition chief Margrethe Vestager said Google had "abused its market dominance" as the world's most popular search engine to give illegal advantage to its Google Shopping service.

It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate," Denmark's Vestager told a news conference. "And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation."Google now has 90 days to "end this conduct" or face further penalty payments, Vestager said.The fine broke the previous EU record for a monopoly case against US chipmaker Intel of 1.06-billion euros in 2009.Google said that it "respectfully" disagreed with the EU decision, which followed a seven-year investigation, and was considering an appeal.Sadly so few people know all the good things the #EU does, protecting consumer rights, workers rights, human rights https://t.co/CScNpgrWQ5"We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case," Kent Walker, the company's senior vice-president and general counsel, said in a statement.Google insisted that it "shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both".'Market dominance'The decision comes less than a year after Vestager shocked Washington and the world with an order that iPhone manufacturer Apple repay 13-billion euros in back taxes in Ireland.Crucially for Google, Brussels has demanded that the US tech giant change the business model for Google Shopping to meet the EU's concerns. While an EU record, the amount is below the maximum possible of more than 8-billion euros, or 10 percent of Google's total revenue of $90-billion last year.Google fined $2.7B by European competition authority for abusing its position in search.

The decision come after a long negotiation period with many twists and turns in which the two sides tried to settle the case amicably.Vestager's predecessor, the Spaniard Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort.Google 'respectfully' disagrees, considers appealGoogle said Tuesday that it "respectfully" disagreed with an EU decision to fine the US tech giant a record 2.4 billion euros in an anti-trust case and was considering an appeal."We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today.

OSTRAVA - Olympic 400m champion and world record-holder Wayde van Niekerk will run in the the 300m at the 56th edition of the Golden Spike in Ostrava on Wednesday.He is seen by many as the heir apparent to Bolt s throne as the sport s top star, and will gauge his form over the rarely-run 300m distance a week after he lowered his 100m career best to 9.94.That improved speed, combined with the 31.0 intermediate split he ran en route to his 43.03 400m world record in Rio, indicates that the world best of 30.85, set by Michael Johnson in Pretoria in 2000, is within the South African s capabilities.READ: Van Niekerk clocks personal best in SloveniaWith a 31.03 to his credit from last year, van Niekerk is currently the third-fastest ever over the distance, trailing Johnson and Bolt, who clocked 30.97 in Ostrava in 2013.Czech star Pavel Maslak, the two-time world indoor and three-time European indoor 400m champion, will also be in the field gunning for a sub-32-second performance.The men s 300m will honour Istvan Gyulai, the late General Secretary of the IAAF.Champions from the Rio 2016 Olympic Games also figure prominently on the middle and long distance programme, among them two-time Olympic champion David Rudisha who will be making his career debut over 1 000m.READ: Van Niekerk believes he can go fasterTesting himself in odd distances isn t anything new for Rudisha who last season in his run-up to a successful Olympic 800m title defence broke the African record over 600m at the Birmingham leg of the IAAF Diamond League, clocking 1:13.10.But going up in distance is uncharted territory for the 28-year-old, who famously broke his own 800m world record in the 2012 Olympic final.He hasn t disclosed any time targets, but a reasonable test of form would be an assault on the meeting record of 2:15.08 set by Ilham Tanui Ozbilen of Turkey in 2014, the fastest time that year over the rarely-run distance.

NEW YORK - Building a network of African women leaders in fields ranging from business to politics could galvanise female leadership across the continent and boost peacebuilding efforts and good governance, the head of UN Women said on Tuesday.The African Women Leaders Network, which was launched last week in New York by the United Nations and the African Union Commission, hopes to drive more women into leadership roles, through mentoring, peer learning and harnessing contacts.By supporting women's leadership in Africa, the platform aims to galvanise their contributions to building and sustaining peace, improving political processes and driving social change, and realising the UN global goals, according to UN Women.WATCH: Graca Machel's calls on business to empower womenThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), adopted in 2015, include targets on eliminating extreme poverty, providing clean energy, and tackling economic and gender inequality by 2030."Peace and governance are big issues in Africa ... so we plan to harness women's leadership, experience and capacity to convince, mediate and make a difference in tough situations," said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of U.N.

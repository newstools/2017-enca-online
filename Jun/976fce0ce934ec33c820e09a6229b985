You still might get a slap even though you're a woman. Careful the next time you come in."Although the interview was over at the time Moyes made his remark, the camera was still running and footage of the incident was published three weeks later by a national newspaper.Moyes was contrite about the incident when questioned at a subsequent press conference.BREAKING: @FA fine former @SunderlandAFC manager David Moyes 30,000 for comments made following @BurnleyOfficial game in March. #SSNHQ pic.twitter.com/nmGUWN8PKF"In the heat of the moment, I made a mistake in my comments to a BBC reporter, which I profoundly regret. I was disappointed with myself for it," said Moyes, who resigned as Sunderland boss following their relegation from the Premier League."I subsequently phoned the reporter and apologised, which she accepted. It's not my character, it's not my type, as most people know and once again I apologise for it."The club described Moyes' conduct as "wholly unacceptable" but stood by him as he attempted - in vain - to preserve Sunderland's status among the English footballing elite.Moyes denied the charge but the FA's independent regulatory commission upheld it.

JOHANNESBURG Kaizer Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung refuses to put the blame on coach Steve Komphela for another trophyless season.Amakhosi held their annual awards on Thursday at which midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala scooped the player of the season award. Congratulations to @sphiweshabba the @Vodacom @VodacomSoccer Player of the Season #KCAwards #Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/C7exnH1vcQ Steve has a job on his hands and he s doing a good job, but obviously it s not only about Steve. It s about the whole collective, the team players and his own technical stuff as well. It s a team effort, not about one individual, said Motaung.Motaung: Hands off Komphela Tshabalala said he would rather be winning as a team than being recognised as an individual. With regards to individual awards, I receive them with a heavy heart simply because I cannot win alone. It would be unfair and selfish for me to celebrate alone, I am only winning when the whole squad is winning."I'm hurting. I want to celebrate with my teammates. I want to create memories with my teammates. I want to bring silverware to Kaizer Chiefs with my teammates.

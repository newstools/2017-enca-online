It s shocking ... I consider it an accident for now, until there have been some forensic investigations to determine the cause of the fire and, of course, the extent of damage incurred. It is unclear what caused the fire but Sonwabo Mbananga, a spokesman for the provincial office, said it is suspected that the fire started on higher floors of the building.READ: UPDATE: Fire at Gauteng premier's building contained We are in no position to determine the cause of the fire but I can confirm that the block where the director-general and the executives sit are the ones severely affected."He said no injuries had been reported."A preliminary investigation will take place once the fire is put out and by the fire department." At this point it was considered coincidental that the fire started on the same day as the blaze at the offices of Gauteng Premier David Makhura, Mbananga said.Makhura said the fire at his Johannesburg offices was apparently caused by an electrical fault.He had had to leave the ANC's policy conference at Nasrec, south of Johannesburg, on Friday morning to assess the situation at his office.His staff members were evacuated unharmed.According to Makhura, an employee who saw the fire start said it had been caused by a malfunctioning electrical plug.The fire, which was contained to the finance department, broke out just days after Makhura s office tabled its 2017 budget."As I speak now the fire is put down on the seventh floor--- everything that has been burnt there we have an off-site back-up, particularly the files. We have everything backed up off sight and that s part of our disaster recovery strategy, Makhura said eNCA

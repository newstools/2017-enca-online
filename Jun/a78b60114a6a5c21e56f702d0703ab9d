JOHANNESBURG As the ANC goes into its national policy conference, some leaders are worried that what s meant to be a festival of ideas could turn into a battleground for factional politics.The ANC leadership race has proven difficult to manage, resulting in the decision to open the discussion of names in May.It s now feared that policy discussions could split into two extreme factions. There is no country that I know in the world whose economy is run by the minority in the country, and the majority of the population is not part of the mainstream of the economy, this is South Africa today. And that has to change, it's not sustainable, said ANC NEC member, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Comrades we should not dupe our people and deceive them, and make empty promises. The African National Congress-led Alliance must be truthful, it must be straight. And when it speaks, it must be speaking about what is attainable and not make empty promises to our people, said ANC deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.READ: ANC NPC: It s written in the cloudsThere s been a lot of talk in the country about radically transforming the economy to accommodate the poor black majority.ANC heavyweights, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa who are seen as frontrunners to the ANC presidential thrown, have been followed at every turn, to listen to their interpretations of radical economic transformation.But with a highly divided ANC, there s worry that its policy conference could be turned into a battleground, where factions align themselves with policies being championed by their preferred candidates.For example the party s youth league has publicly named Dlamini-Zuma as its preferred candidate.READ: ANCYL names its ideal top sixIts leaders say the wealth of the country has been concentrated in white hands for too long. The ANC Youth League noted that the Strategy and Tactics document seems to be shy on the issue of White Monopoly Capital, but emphasises monopoly capital and not white monopoly capital. The ANC Youth League believes that this is a right-wing departure from the movement's historic perspective... added ANCYL secretary general, Njabulo Nzuza.But a province like Gauteng, which has yet to pronounce on its preferred candidate, has made it clear that the concept of white monopoly capital is foreign to ANC vocabulary.READ: The ANC must clean houseThe party s alliance partners, on the other hand, are focusing their energies on the fight against the capture of the state by the infamous Gupta family.The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has its loyalties divided between Cyril Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma, but it s yet to make an official choice.Key among its policy proposals is the emotive issue of land expropriation without compensation.But the ANC's general secretary has warned that the party's mission has never been about avenging injustices of the past, but rather correcting them. If we don't understand that comrade, I can tell you that we're going to go to that policy conference, we're going to sit two streams that will be fighting there. One will be one that is pushing the ANC into adventurism and populism, and another stream that will be pushing the ANC to be conservative and say leave the status quo, let sleeping dogs lie... said ANC Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe.ANC bosses have warned that it's of the outmost importance that the policy conference does not lose focus, as it's meant to ease the daily struggles of ordinary South Africans.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG – Visual representations of the words used most often in the ANC’s Policy Conference discussion documents – or word clouds – paint a picture of what lies at the heart of the current deliberations. The ruling party is heading into a policy conference that precedes its December elective conference, and taking centre stage are issues relating to the economy, poverty, Africa, and organisational renewal. A word cloud is a visual representation of the words that are used most often in a document. The more a word is used in a given document, the more visually prominent it appears in a word cloud of that document. Creating word clouds of the ANC’s policy documents gives us a glimpse into what it is that really carries weight in those documents. READ: What becomes of the broken-hearted? Economic transformation While much has been speculated about proposed “radical economic transformation” by the ANC, the policy documents themselves state that this should not be done rashly, but through infrastructure spending, expanding the mining value chain, growing the manufacturing sector, and improving agro-processing beneficiation.  In the paper on Economic Transformation, the words “transformation” and “employment” are used the same number of times (50 each), and are amongst the most prominent in the document. “Infrastructure” is used 45 times, while “investment” is used 40 times.

On the global front, “Palestinian” is used 9 times, as are “military,” with “BRICS” used 8 times.

The word “poor” 115 times. “Serve” features 43 times, while “Africa” is used 325 times. The word “must” features 532 times, “will 509 times, and “can” 164 times, certainly indicative of a marked degree of optimism, even if it is possibly forced optimism. For what it’s worth, the word “capture” appears 8 times. Other frequently-used words that give some clues as to the focus of the papers include: “transformation” (258 uses), “services” (219 uses), “capacity” (145 uses), and “change” (145 uses).

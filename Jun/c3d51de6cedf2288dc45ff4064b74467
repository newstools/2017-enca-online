SANTA FE - Argentina coach Daniel Hourcade has made one change to the starting side for the second, series-deciding Test against England in northeastern city Santa Fe Saturday.Winger Ramiro Moyano is promoted from the bench to replace Matias Moroni, who is among the eight replacements as the Pumas seek to level the series after a 38-34 first-Test defeat. There are two other alterations among the substitutes as Argentina try to snap a seven-match losing streak against England since 2009.Tighthead prop Ramiro Herrera comes in for Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro and in a change of loose forward cover, Tomas Lezana replaces Leonardo Senatore.Another substitute is veteran utility back Juan Martin Hernandez, whose drop goal gave the Pumas a late three-point lead during the first Test in San Juan last Saturday.But New Zealand-born rugby league convert Denny Solomona silenced the home crowd 100 seconds from time with a match-winning solo try for the tourists."We did so many things so well in the first Test, especially after half-time, only to suffer a heartbreaking defeat," said coach Daniel Hourcade. "I hope we can reverse the scoreline in the second Test as it is psychologically important to halt our run of losses against England."

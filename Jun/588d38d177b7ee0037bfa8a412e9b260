JOHANNESBURG ANC MPs would have to follow the party line when voting on a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.That was according to ANC Treasurer General, Zweli Mkhize, who made the comments at the ANC's provincial general council meeting in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday.The DA asked Parliament to set a date for the motion, following the Constitutional Court's ruling that the Speaker did have the power to decide whether the vote should be secret or not.The request for the motion followed Zuma's cabinet reshuffle in March. Our members in Parliament will not be given the feeling that they will be voting as individuals," Mkhize told delegates."Party proportional representation means they will have to discuss the issue and take a decision as ANC collective as ANC set of deployees."The ANC has no intention to get out of power.

The issues of any division, the issues of factions we need to deal with them because the ANC is not a coalition of factions. "The ANC is one organisation."It is important for us to be able discuss where we have got differences of views and preferences to a point where we are able to say, this is what best for the African National Congress and if we take that approach then the ANC will survive," he said. There is a lot of excitement with some of the opposition who somehow believe that they may just take over this country."And we must make it very clear that the ANC is not prepared to hand over power. He also re-iterated that the governing party supported a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.eNCA

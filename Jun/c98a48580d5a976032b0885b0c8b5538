LOS ANGELES - As one of the world's largest entertainment companies, Disney was used to adoring fans but one man topped them all, visiting its California theme park 2,000 days (over five-and-a-half years) in a row.Jeff Reitz marked the milestone on Thursday, using his Disneyland Resort annual pass, which had enabled his trek to the park on a daily basis since January 1, 2012."What we mostly know about him is that he loves Disneyland," said John McClintock, a spokesman for the theme park."When I asked him what he likes about the park, he said he likes all the shows and all the attractions but he did mention that he really likes to listen to the music in the park," he added.READ: Hong Kong Disneyland to expand with $1.4 billion investment"I guess he finds it relaxing."McClintock said Disney had yet to come across someone as enamored with the park as Reitz, an Air Force veteran in his 40s who usually showed up after work and spent a few hours there."His girlfriend frequently comes with him but not every day," he said."That would be true love, wouldn't it?"AFP

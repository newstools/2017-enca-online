JOHANNESBURG - ANC NEC member and Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokoyane said on Friday that President Jacob Zuma "hit all the right buttons" in his opening address of the ruling party's National Policy Conference (NPC). This is despite a number of people, including ANC leaders, falling asleep during the address that has generally been viewed as long-winded. #ANCNPC security personnel and SG Gwede Mantashe falling asleep as President Jacob Zuma delivers opening address pic.twitter.com/mWcD0VJEgFSpeaking to the eNCA in her capacity as the party's head of organising and campaigns, she said Zuma's empahsis on implemented ANC policies, evaluation of the capacity of the state, and assessment of the state of the economy were all that the party wanted to hear from him.In her own statement regarding the economy, such as that the dropping rand simply needed to be "picked up", Mokonyane said she had meant that people's critique of the economy should not be linked to individual personalities all the time. "The ANC remains the strategic centre of power. Frivolous things and cheap politics will not take us anywhere." Just after Zuma finished his address, the rapper Jay Z was the one trending on eNCA.com, reflecting online trends that had been prevailing all day globally.

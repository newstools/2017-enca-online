VELENJE - South African Wayde van Niekerk proved again on Tuesday why he is truly one of the stars of international athletics when he won the 100 metres at the EA Classic Meeting in Velenje, Slovenia in a time of 9.94 seconds.His winning time is 0.04 faster than his previous best, more importantly, is the fact that he did so at sea level so he can now claim to be an honest member of the sub ten second club in the 100 metres. He ran his previous best of 9.98s in Bloemfontein.READ: Van Niekerk believes he can go faster I am very pleased, said Van Niekerk in an IAAF interview. It is my best time and I am glad the race played out the way I wanted it to. This bodes well for my two main distances the 200m and 400m. On June 10 in Kingston, Van Niekerk set a new South African record in the 200m when he clocked 19.84. Van Niekerk is currently the fastest athlete over 200m and sixth fastest athlete over the 100m.Tuesday s 100 metres was an all-South African affair with Emile Erasmus (Tuks) finishing second in 10.12 and Henricho Bruintjies (Tuks) third in 10.14. It is the second best time of Erasmus s career.Well done to our #Vitality ambassador @WaydeDreamer who has just run 9.94 at an international race in Slovenia. New 100m PB for our star! pic.twitter.com/Ye3jHqKm3M I cannot complain as to how my race played out. I did not have the best of starts but I made up for it in the driving phase, said Erasmus. What excites me is that I can feel how I am getting stronger over the last 40 metres each time I raced. I tried to keep up with Wayde but the 400m Man is a class act. As a sprinter, he has got unbelievable stamina.

She won in 13.03 running into a 0.9m/s headwind.The question is definitely not whether Steenkamp can dip under 13 seconds but when she will do it. The safe money will be to bet on her improving Corien Botha s South African record of 12.94 set in 1998 in Salamanca.Other South Africans who competed on Tuesday were Jovan van Vuuren who finished third in the long jump with his best attempt of 7.41m. Dylan Cotter was fourth with a best distance of 7.38m.Jacob Pink was third in the 800m running 1:46.33. Tamzin Thomas won the 200m in a time of 23.82 while Lynique Prinsloo finished fourth in the women s long jump with a leap of 6.25m. African News Agency

CAPE TOWN - The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has slammed the sanction meted out to Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Shayne Ramsay over her offensive posts about homeless people in Cape Town.Sea Point councillor Ramsey, who last year criticised homeless people in a Facebook post which caused outrage, has reportedly pleaded guilty at a disciplinary committee and fined R10,000.Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu on Thursday described the fine as an affront to the country s constitutional values founded on human dignity, equality and non-racialism.Mahlangu said that the relatively low monetary value that the DA-led City of Cape Town had attached to the transgression instead of withdrawing her as an elected public representative was consistent with the DA s racial policies. It has unashamedly defended its failure to provide decent housing to the very poor and homeless whom it treats with the same contempt as Ramsay, he said.African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - Brian Molefe will be appearing in the Labour Court on Tuesday to challenge his dismissal from Eskom.Molefe claims that his dismissal from the state owned enterprise was contractually illegal and was politically motivated.Molefe left Eskom, claiming to have resigned in the interests of good governance, and susequently became a Member of Parliament.He later resigned as an MP and rejoined Eskom as CEO, following controversy around his receipt of a R30-million payout.He subsequently denied having resigned from Eskom and claimed that he had taken early retirement. Eskom responded by claiming that they had determined that Molefe's early retirement was unprocedural and therefore he had been reinstated.Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown, who refused to sanction the R30-million payout to Molefe, initially agreed to Molefe's reappointment to his old position as a means of reversing the large payout.READ: Court rules Molefe can't work at Eskom until labour matter heardHowever, she insisted that she believed he had resigned from the SOE and was never informed otherwise, and later reversed her backing for his reappointment.She later dismissed him as Eskom CEO after he had been reinstated by the board, and appointed Johnny Dladla as Group CEO.Following the resignation of board chairman Ben Ngubane, she made numerous new appointments to the board. eNCA

You risked that for Blue?" he asks rhetorically, referring to the couple's five-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.READ: Beyonce gives birth to twins: reportsBeyonce recently gave birth to twins, her father revealed on social media, although the family has yet to confirm details.On the album, Jay-Z suggests they conceived the twins naturally.Discussing the album on iHeartRadio, he said 4:44 was named for the time of morning when he woke up and wrote the song.He and Beyonc have matching ring-finger tattoos of the Roman numeral "IV" - four being the day in different months of their wedding and both their birthdays.Embracing lesbian mother Jay-Z, who recently became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, infuses the album with touches of house music and reggae, giving a sleeker, contemporary sound to the artist whose later albums had veered into mainstream pop.On the soulful "Smile," Jay-Z for the first time confirms hushed rumours that his mother is lesbian, explaining how she turned to substances to cope with the stigma."Mama had four kids but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long, that she's a thespian," raps Jay-Z, who has spoken of how his father's absence contributed to his troubled youth in public housing in Brooklyn."Don't matter to me if it's a him or her / I just want to see you smile through all the hate," he raps.READ: Jay Z to make feature film, doccie about Trayvon Martin"Smile" opens with a snippet from Stevie Wonder and closes with a poem by Jay-Z's mother, Gloria Carter, who recites, "The world is changing and they say it's time to be free / But you live with the fear of just being me."Jay-Z, like many rappers of his generation, employed homophobic slurs in his early music but was also one of the first prominent voices in hip-hop to speak out in favour of gay rights.Harsh words on Prince estateJay-Z, who alongside Beyonc campaigned for and became friends with former president Barack Obama, takes on race relations on "The Story of O.J." and "Moonlight" as he concludes that African Americans will invariably be judged by their colour."We stuck in La La Land / Even when we win, we gonna lose," he quips about this year's Oscars mix-up in announcing best picture.Jay-Z elsewhere throws veiled barbs at other rappers including onetime prot g Kanye West, who last year ranted against Jay-Z and in support of then president-elect Donald Trump before entering a hospital.READ: Kanye West deletes social media accountsJay-Z has especially harsh words for the estate of pop icon Prince, a longtime rebel in the music industry who had signed a deal with Tidal shortly before his death.The rapper denounces the "greedy bastards" who have commercialised Prince with moves such as bringing his catalogue onto leading streaming service Spotify."I'm surprised you ain't auctioned off the casket," Jay-Z inveighs.But Jay-Z's mind on 4:44 is more on his own "legacy" - which is the title of the last song in which the 47-year-old addresses his children, vowing that the family's fortune and philanthropy will outlive him."I'd like to see a nice peace fund / Ideas for people who look like we / We going to start a society within a society."AFP

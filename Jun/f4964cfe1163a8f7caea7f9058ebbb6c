JOHANNESBURG - Eskom employee Thembisile Yende knew too much.The officer investigating Eskom employee Thembisile Yende's murder says she may have been killed because she was planning to blow the whistle on a copper-theft syndicate.Yende was found dead in her office at one of the power utility's substations last month.The Eskom employee accused of her murder will be back in court on Thursday.She was on the verge of blowing the whistle on illegal copper dealings when she was murdered.These allegations were part of the testimony the Springs Magistrate s Court heard this week.Investigating Officer Christo Lotz told the court that a key witness says Yendi was about to report David Ngwenya to Eskom managers for his involvement in copper theft.Ngwenya is now accused of her murder.Eskom says it's aware of previous staff involvement in cable theft."Just recently, I think it was April this year, there were three people who were arrested in the Randfontein area, who were allegedly selling some of our cables," Eskom spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe said. "And that arrest happened because of the fact that we had encouraged our people to blow the whistle."Yende was found dead in her office at an Eskom substation last month. A post-mortem revealed she'd suffered head injuries and bruises to her neck.Ngwenya was arrested based on a state witness's testimony, and he was later pointed out in an identity parade.The court also heard that Yende was injected with a drug to weaken her before she was beaten and strangled at the substation.While Eskom could not speak on this specific case as it is sub judice, the power utility says it encourages whistleblowers to speak up on staff involvement in cable theft."On people who are blowing the whistle, someone will either suspect, or know for sure that someone is involved," said Phasiwe. "If you are colleagues, working in the same division, and you know one of your colleagues has either sold or is planning to sell something which belongs to the company. Especially scrap cables, or scrap metals." In an affidavit read by his legal counsel, Ngwenya denied killing Yende.His bail application at the Springs Magistrates Court continues on ThursdayeNCA

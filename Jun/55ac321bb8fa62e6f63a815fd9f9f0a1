JOHANNESBURG - The SA Communist Party has called for changes to the tripartite alliance.It comes in the wake of the Gupta email leaks, which implicated various officials in dealings with the family."One way or another in the coming months the ANC-led alliance is being and will be reconfigured. Whether there is the internal capacity in the ANC itself to drive this process is uncertain but that it must happen is obvious," the party's General Secretary Blade Nzimande said.READ: ANC downplays rift with SACPHe said the SACP was actively engaging with Cosatu and with ANC stalwarts among others, to work out what the reconfigured alliance would look like, saying it would likely be "built on rootedness within working class and poor communities.""In the face of chronic violence, for instance in localities, we need to help communities to act together on a non-partisan basis to reclaim their streets and neighbourhoods through street committees and other organs of democratic, popular power."Video courtesy DStv 403eNCA

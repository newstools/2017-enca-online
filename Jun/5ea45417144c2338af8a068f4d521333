JOHANNESBURG - Let's face it, our law enforcement officers have a tough job.They have to protect people, endanger their own lives and do it all in a uniform and often heavy equipment.So what's better than taking a breather from such a stressful job? Dancing of course. @gmpolice The funniest thing about Police is seeing them dance. Haha!#FunnyMoments #Police The video below is a compilation by Storyful of police letting their hair down and having dance-offs.With moves like those, maybe dancing could be added to the police training regimen? Talking about police training regimens ...Who could forget the 'Stomach in, Chest out' song by Djexcess years ago, which was inspired by former national commissioner of police Bheki Cele, who spoke about police officers taking pride in their bodies. Let's go seven years back in time this #ThrowBackThursday. YouTube

JOHANNESURG Elroy Gelant, one of South Africa s prominent middle distance athletes and the SA 5000m record holder, will put his speed to the test at the 2nd annual Cell C Day Of Races powered by Reebok at Roosevelt High School in Emmarentia on Sunday, 11 June 2017.Gelant claimed gold at the inaugural Cell C Day Of Races in Cape Town in 2016 completing the 5km route in a time of 14 minutes and three seconds. I like road running because it s a social gathering of athletes. It attracts a huge number of people, says Gelant. The Cell C Day Of Races is a 5km road race. This is a great distance for all runners (young, old, elite and beginners) as it s not too far. My goal on race day will be to run a sub 14 minute race. I ll be testing my speed. A good 5km will lead to a faster 10km race. Winning will definitely be a good confidence booster. The men s elite race will be the source of much excitement with fellow South Africans Stephen Mokoka, Sibusiso Nzima and Lungile Gongqa also gunning for gold.The women s elite race will see an array of up and coming athletes toe the line, including Maria Shai, Rachel Modise, Vuyokazi Gebe, Kataza Shipalana, Liziwe Mabona and Lelani Roodt.According to Roodt, 5km is currently her distance of choice. In future, however, I will focus on 10km and track distance 1500m and 3000m. The Cell C Day Of Races will be a new challenge for me. I ll get to compete against some very strong athletes. My goal will be a sub 18 minute race. Modise is also hoping to improve her 5km time. A 5km race is for everybody, says Modise. My goal will be to test my speed. I am looking forward to socialising with other runners and hope to receive a lot of support on the day. African News Agency

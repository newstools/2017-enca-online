JERUSALEM - Letters from Albert Einstein giving colleagues his thoughts on physics, God and Israel in the 1950s go under the hammer at a Jerusalem auction house on 20 June.The website of Winners auction house describes five signed letters written in English between 1951 and 1954.The site gives current estimates of their combined value as between $31,000 and $46,000 (R395,690 and R587,153).In a 1951 letter to eminent physicist David Bohm, Einstein discusses Bohm's linkage between quantum theory and "relativistic field theory"."I must confess that I am not able to guess how such unification could be achieved," Einstein writes.READ: Scientists win US$3m for detecting Einstein's wavesThe typed letter includes an equation added in neat handwriting and the writer's signature.Bohm, born in the United States to Jewish immigrant parents, had worked with Einstein at Princeton University before fleeing to Brazil after losing his post in Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist witch-hunts.In a 1954 letter to Bohm, who was living in Sao Paulo, Einstein empathises with his friend's struggles in his complex theoretical work."If God has created the world his primary worry was certainly not to make its understanding easy for us. I feel it strongly since 50 years," he writes.Winners said the letters came from the estate of Bohm's late widow.

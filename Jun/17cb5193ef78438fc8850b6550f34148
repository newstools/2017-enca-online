CZECH REPUBLIC – South Africa’s Wayde van Niekerk clocked the best time ever in the men’s 300m with a time of 30.81 seconds at the IAAF World Challenge League event in Mlada Boleslav, in the Czech Republic, on Wednesday. .@WaydeDreamer is now the first man in history to go:
		
		sub-10 for 100m
		sub-20 for 200m
		sub-31 for 300m
		sub-44 for 400m Van Niekerk powered to victory in the event by a clear margin over the field, and in the process bettered the previous best mark of 30.85 set by American Michael Johnson in 2000. The 24-year-old, however, cannot lay claim to another world record as the 300m is not an official Olympic event. Van Niekerk is the Olympic and world record holder in the 400m with the 43.03 he ran in Rio last year to claim gold at the quadrennial showpiece. Fellow South African Clarence Munyai claimed third, and in the process set the world junior best in the event crossing the line in 31.61. African News Agency

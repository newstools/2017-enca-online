LONDON A fine century from former captain Hashim Amla helped South Africa post 299 for six in their opening Champions Trophy fixture against Sri Lanka at The Oval on Saturday.The 34-year-old is the fastest batsman to 25 centuries, having achieved the milestone in his 151st innings.It was his fifth ODI hundred against Sri Lanka.South Africa were slow out of the blocks after being put in to bat in overcast conditions.There were no boundaries in the first six overs and Sri Lanka -- who suffered a huge blow before the start of play when captain Angelo Mathews was ruled out of the game with a calf strain -- contained the world's number one-ranked team to 32 runs in the first 10 overs.Fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep, who came on as first change, provided the breakthrough when Quinton de Kock was caught behind for 23.However, South Africa then made hay as Amla and Francois du Plessis added 145 runs for the second wicket -- Lasith Malinga costing his side dear when he dropped Du Plessis at long-leg when he was on eight.

So far we believe that it is adequate. But the security aspects, we'll analyse the scene today and advise if we need to increase those measures."The scene Mashilo refers to is the protest that took place outside Mapaila s home on Tuesday, by people claiming to be marching in defence of President Zuma.The police minister's office won't say if Mapaila's been afforded state security since the two incidents - which happened in broad daylight.Police Ministry Spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga said, "Mr Mapaila has already met with the minister, they will have already discussed the matter. So it actually is taking the necessary attention that it deserves."Mapaila has since confirmed to eNCA that he met with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula but there had not been any security personnel provided to him or his family.His story is similar to that of another outspoken Zuma critic, ANC Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza.She told eNCA that police had strongly advised her against going to her home in KwaZulu-Natal, where her son and daughter live; yet no state security personnel have been provided for the family s protection. Yet ANC NEC member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was driven around by the Presidential Protection Unit long after her AU privileges had expired.Commenting on Dlamini-Zuma, Mbalula said, "She will be on VIP protection, she's got to be on VIP protection because I've seen the threat.. Even beyond being the Chair of the African Union."Meanwhile, the ANC has distanced itself and its president from the actions of the so-called Zuma defenders.ANC spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa explained, "They do not represent President Zuma, they do not represent the ANC, they do not represent what we stand for as the African National Congress so if they want to do anything that is wrong, they must not misuse the name of the President of the ANC."I think in this instance, clearly the name of the President of the ANC, President Zuma, is being misused for people who've got their own group interests who have got nothing to do with the principles of what we represent as an organisation."Mapaila says the threats against him and his family are escalating, as suspicious vehicles continue to drive past his home. eNCA

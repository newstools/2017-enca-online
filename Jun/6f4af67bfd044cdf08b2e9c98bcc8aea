"Nine boys were playing an ICC event for the first time and four to five boys were in the team for the first time, so I think it is a very good sign for the youngsters."Fakhar Zaman, Rumman Raees, Shadab Khan, Fahim Ashraf -- all new boys and it is very good sign for Pakistan cricket the way Hasan Ali played," he continued. "This was the whole team's effort."Then he sang a victory jingle about Pakistan's breathtaking win and prompted the crowd with chants of "Long live Pakistan" before finally retiring back inside.AFP

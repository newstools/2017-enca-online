ABUJA Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday faced a fresh call to quit, nearly two months after he left the country on indefinite sick leave."I want to say that it's time that the president throws in the towel and resigns and allows his country to move forward," Ekiti state governor Ayo Fayose told reporters.Buhari, 74, has not been seen since May 7, when he left Abuja for London to undergo treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.READ: Nigeria's Buhari heads to Britain for medical treatmentHe had previously spent nearly two months in the British capital in January and February, returning to Abuja looking gaunt and frail, and saying he had "never been so ill".On Sunday, a recorded message purportedly from Buhari was issued to mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in which he sounded tired and weak.Fayose, an outspoken member of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), took out newspaper advertisements before the 2015 election claiming Buhari would die in office.He also said the former military ruler was too old to be president.READ: Nigeria's ailing President Buhari returns home: witnessAt a news conference on Wednesday, Fayose repeated unconfirmed claims that Buhari was terminally ill.

JOHANNESBURG - The ANC was being damaged by leaked emails alleging fraud in the awarding of state contracts, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said on Wednesday. AmaBhungane, a non-profit group that has a strong track record of exposing what it says is government corruption, last week released some of more than 100,000 leaked emails and documents. It said the emails show companies owned by the Gupta family unduly influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. President Jacob Zuma, as well as the Gupta family and its companies, have denied all allegations of influence-peddling or improper dealings.

He said the debate about removing the 75-year-old leader would become "less complex" when a new ANC leader was chosen at the party conference in December. Zuma, who has survived two no-confidence votes within the party in the last six months can stay in power until a 2019 election. Reuters

JOHANNESBURG - Standard and Poor's has affirmed a sub-investment grade for South Africa.The ratings agency said on Friday it was affirming its negative outlook on the foreign and local currency ratings because of political volatility and uncertainty about fiscal policy.The pace of economic growth remained "weak, posing risks to the pace of fiscal consolidation, with rising contingent liabilities, and South Africa's ability to reduce economic inequalities in the medium term," the agency said."We are affirming our 'BB+/B' foreign currency, 'BBB-/A-3' local currency, and zaAA-/zaA-1 national scale ratings on South Africa. Political risks would remain high in the run-up to the ANC elective conference in December 2017."In our view, the policy agenda is at increased risk of being overshadowed by political infighting. We believe the current political environment could result in the private sector delaying business investment decisions, thereby restraining GDP growth."Nevertheless, we believe growth will rebound from the paltry 0.3% of GDP in 2016 to 1% in 2017 and average 1.5% in 2017-2020, thanks to an improvement in agriculture output after a drought and improved terms of trade. More broadly, we consider that South Africa faces reduced predictability of future policy responses, due to the moderate risk of challenges to political institutions owing to demands by parts of the population desiring greater economic participation. The socioeconomic dynamics of skewed income distribution, poverty, and high unemployment have the potential, in our view, to shift policy toward intervention and income redistribution, at the cost of headline GDP growth.S&P said it might consider lowering the rating if fiscal and macroeconomic performance deteriorated substantially from its baseline forecasts.It could also revise the outlook to stable if political risks reduced and economic growth strengthened. eNCA

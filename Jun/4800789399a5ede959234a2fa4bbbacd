JOHANNESBURG United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa has challenged ANC MPs to vote with their conscience should National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete approve a secret ballot for the vote of confidence in President Jacob Zuma.Holomisa was speaking after the Constitutional Court handed down a unanimous judgment that the Speaker of Parliament does have the power to instruct the use of a secret ballot.The UDM had taken the matter to the highest court in the land after Mbete said she did not have powers to instruct a secret vote on removing the president.WATCH: Speaker has power to decide on secret ballot: chief justiceHolomisa said that his party felt vindicated by the judgement. He has accused Mbete of putting the interests of the governing ANC ahead of Parliament. This judgment also means that the threats issued by Zuma and others, where they threatened the ANC MPs, falls flat now, said a jubilant Holomisa outside the Constitutional Court. Those MPs are free to vote and follow their conscience.He said the UDM and other opposition parties would not cease objecting to Zuma until 2019. We have been in charge ceasing this initiative since the day Zuma was elected. We are still saying that you cannot have a questionable character and vote that questionable character into the high office. Holomisa said should the ANC fail to put the people first, then the people should vote them out in the 2019 elections. In his judgment ,Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said that the governing party dictated who was appointed to positions of power in Parliament.He stressed that MPs might face real consequences if they went against the party line but he reminded that MPs are required to swear allegiance to the country, not their party eNCA

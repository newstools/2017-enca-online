SINGAPORE - Oil prices dipped on Monday, weighed down by continuing expansion in US drilling that had helped to maintain high global supplies despite an OPEC-led initiative to cut production to tighten the market.Signs of faltering demand also prompted weakening sentiment, dropping prices to levels comparable to when the output cuts were first announced late last year.Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down 13 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $47.24 per barrel at 4.06am.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $44.59 per barrel.Prices for both benchmarks were down by around 14 percent since late May, when producers led by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) extended their pledge to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by an extra nine months until the end of the first quarter of 2018.Traders said the main factor driving prices lower was a steady rise in US production undermining the OPEC-led effort.WATCH: Oil price downturn"The US oil rig count continued to rise, up by six last week," Goldman Sachs said late on Friday."That's 22 weeks in a row that oil rigs have been added, a record run," said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.US producers added 431 oil rigs since a trough on May 27, 2016, Goldman said.If the rig count held at current levels, the bank added, US oil production would increase by 770,000 bpd between the fourth quarter of last year and the same quarter this year in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara shale oil fields.Supplies from OPEC and other countries participating in the output cuts, including top producer Russia, also remained high as some countries did not fully comply with their pledges.There were also indicators that demand growth in Asia, the world's biggest oil-consuming region, was stalling.

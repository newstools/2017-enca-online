LONDON - Springbok and Lions flanker Jaco Kriel is believed to be highly sought-after by English Premiership club, London Wasps.Kriel has been a red-hot performer for the Lions over recent seasons, and which saw him rewarded with a Springbok call-up last year, with the talented 27-year-old going on to feature in seven Tests off the bench.The consistent form of Kriel has seen his market value considerably increase over the last 12 months, while he signed a two-year contract with Japanese club Kubota Spears last year. The increasingly common deal enables a player such as Kriel to remain contracted to the Lions, while playing in Japan outside of the Super Rugby season.READ: Etzebeth leads from the front as Boks demolish FranceHowever, it now appears that SA Rugby and the Lions could have a fight on their hands to ensure Kriel isn t lured overseas on a permanent basis.The Wasps are reportedly very interested in securing the services of Kriel, who made his run-on debut in his eighth Test appearance for the Boks this past Saturday, with the robust loose forward offering immense value through his ability to comfortably slot in at openside or blindside flank.Congratulations to South Africa, beating France 35-12 to clinch @CastleLagerSA 3-0. Well done to all involved @MTNza @ASICS_ZA @FlySafair pic.twitter.com/yJC60VI6WXAlthough Kriel has been a mainstay in the Bok camp since the start of last season, he has generally been deployed in an impact-player role, with some opportunities only arising as a result of other injuries.Yet, there is no doubt that Kriel continues to be held in extremely high regard, with the Lions star having served as the only specialist No 6 in the Bok camp for the recently-completed June series against France.READ: Hansen dismisses 'desperate' Gatland's claims about MurrayWith such modern-day flankers in short supply, SA Rugby should do everything in its power to ensure Kriel remains in the country, especially when one considers he is still some way away from reaching the new 30-cap eligibility ruling for overseas-based players.The good news from a South African perspective is that Kriel is believed to still be contracted to the Lions for next year, while SA Rugby would surely be willing to counter any offer that Wasps may table.

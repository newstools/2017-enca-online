JOHANNESBURG - George Bizos spent most of his life defending anti-apartheid activists.Now, at the age of 88 he's still determined to stand for the truth.He was the junior counsel in the first inquest into the death of anti-apartheid avtivist Ahmed Timol and has written about how he believes the law was defeated in this matter. Bizos told the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol, of a document the original magistrate used to rule his death a suicide.Speaking at the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday the veteran human rights lawyer said the document had not been entered as evidence, so the family's legal team was unable to interrogate it.George Bizos takes to the stand in the #TimolInquest pic.twitter.com/aEiTzFHQUfAdvocate George Bizos takes his oath. He will be testifying in the #TimolInquest pic.twitter.com/osfEb9ibIuBizos: there were people in the justice system who did not perform their duty, you have to be frank and say it #TimolInquestBizos: unfortunately there were doctors who said that did not see any injuries on Biko, they lied.We will deal with that later #TimolInquestIn 1971, Timol died while in police custody at the then John Vorster Square.The family is challenging a ruling that Timol committed suicide in detention.Bizos said the magistrate based his decision on a document that allegedly came from the Communist Party.The document instructed members to commit suicide rather than betray their comrades.He also says Magistrate de Villiers who agreed that Timol committed suicide in 1972, ignored pathology reports of two doctors who had said Timol sustained his injuries during his detention.Instead the magistrate went with a doctor s report that he was wounded before being arrested on the October 22, 1971.Bizos says it was normal at the time for police to choose doctors who'd back their claims."I can only say that unfortunately, the security police were a law unto themselves," Bizos told the inquest."And they actually decided which magistrate would take which case. Unfortunately there were security policemen, there were prosecutors, there were senior prosecutors that did the bidding of the security police and there was nothing we could do about it," he said.Bizos: state pathologist said that the injuries on Timol's body were sustained before he was detained #TimolInquestBizos: two other doctors said that the injuries on Timol's body were sustained during detention #TimolInquestBizos: the magistrate ruled with state lawyer, that the injuries were sustained before detention #TimolInquestBizos also told the court about the callous treatment of relatives of detainees by security police during the apartheid era.Security police claimed that reports of the torture of detainees, were an invention of the communist party and the liberal press.They said they could never hurt detainees as they saw them as their children.Bizos remembers hearing Ahmed Timol's mother ask security police about her son.He said she asked "Where is my son, are you treating him well? Please do not hit him. I am his mother. I never hit him."He continued: "And what is his answer to this mother? It is your fault your son is in jail, because you didn't hit him. If you had hit him he wouldn't be what he is and by implication we hit him for what he is. They joked about it."Bizos: I think that history is important and has not time. #TimolInquestBizos: What was said was not just. There are other (cases) and the same applies #TimolInquestBizos: the 69 people who were treated the same, justice was defeated #TimolInquesteNCA

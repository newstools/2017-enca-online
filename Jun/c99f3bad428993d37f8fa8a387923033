JOHANNESBURG - MTN Group said on Thursday that it will oppose the lawsuit brought against it by Turkish operator, Turkcell, over the disputed and lucrative licence to operate in Iran, adding that Turkcell has no legal merit to claim.This comes after Turkcell said that it would proceed with its $4.2 billion lawsuit in the South Gauteng High Court against the South African mobile operator over the disputed Iran license.Turkcell sued MTN in a United States court in 2012, alleging that MTN used bribery and undue influence to win the Iran license which had originally been awarded to Turkcell. But the case was later withdrawn and filed in South Africa in 2013.READ: Turkcell files $4.2 billion lawsuit against MTN in SAMTN said in a terse statement that recent developments in the matter were procedural in nature and had nothing to do with the merits of the case. The lawsuit currently before the courts is not a new action and arises from a claim that was lodged in 2013, relating to Turkcell s alleged grievances arising from its unsuccessful bid to obtain a mobile licence in Iran, and the awarding of that licence to Irancell, MTN said. MTN continues to believe that there is no legal merit to Turkcell s claim and will accordingly oppose it. African News Agency

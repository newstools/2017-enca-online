JOHANNESBURG - Aerial resources have been grounded due to gale force winds in Kynsna. Eleven aircraft have been working in the area but will remain on the ground until further notice. However, at least two Oryx helicopters from the SANDF are still attempting to transport water to the hotspot areas during the small window periods of a lull in the winds. The winds are proving to make the situation extremely difficult to contain as the fires spread extremely quickly. The fire is now heading past Plettenberg Bay in the direction of Port Elizabeth.  Between 500 and 800 firefighters remain on duty. Residents from some areas are being evacuated. Authorities, meanwhile, are appealing to residents in Knysna to reduce their water consumption, as growing demand from firefighters is heavily impacting the town's water reserves. So far the tally is over 400 properties have been destroyed in Knysna but the count is still ongoing #knysnafire "Before the fires we were at level three water restrictions but because of fires that will change. Residents must limit themselves to about 400 litres of water daily because our water consumption has increased drastically. I think at a point of 16.5 mega litres," Eleonore Bouw-Spies, Knysna's mayor said during a media briefing on Saturday morning. Firefighters have been battling blazes across Knysna and the rest of the Garden Route, where gale force winds continued to fan the flames along. Authorities say fire is contained between Knysna and Plett but fire is spreading towards Sedgefield, no need to evacuate town #knysnafires Big fire just as you enter Knysna #KnysnaFire pic.twitter.com/XKC88aBnv9 Fires between Plettenberg Bay and Knysna were reportedly contained, while flames in the Sedgefield area south of Knysna continued. The N2 highway is closed between Buffalo Bay and Sedgefield. Firefighters from Working On Fire are providing assistance.

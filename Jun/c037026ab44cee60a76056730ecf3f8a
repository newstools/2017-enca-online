JOHANNESBURG The United Nations envoy for the Central African Republic (CAR) warned against increasing attacks on civilians and peacekeeping personnel, while stressing the need to re-energise the political process to achieve sustainable peace in the conflict-torn country. The intensity of the attacks, their premeditated nature and the targeting of ethnic minorities, are a reminder of the darkest moments of the Central African political and security crisis, said the UN Secretary-General s Special Representative, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, in his briefing to the Security Council on Monday.READ: Dozens of civilians killed in Central African Republic - report The new and disturbing fact is the systematic and fierce aggression against the peacekeepers, he added.The envoy provided an update on the situation in Bangassou, where political spoilers demonstrated their intention of carrying out a de facto ethnic cleansing of the town.He said that the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission (MINUSCA) had gradually regained control of the town, but added that anti-Balaka elements continued to pose a serious threat to civilians and peacekeepers.Clashes between the mainly Muslim S l ka rebel coalition and anti-Balaka militia, which were mostly Christian, plunged the country of 4.5 million people into civil conflict in 2013.Despite significant progress and successful elections, CAR remained in the grip of instability and sporadic unrest.The situation in the southern-central prefectures of Ouaka and Mbomou remained complex as fighting continued between ex-S l ka factions, the Popular Front for the Central African Renaissance (FPRC,) and Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (UPC).Onanga-Anyanga also expressed deep concern about the evolving situation in Bria, where some 80 percent of the civilian population were displaced.

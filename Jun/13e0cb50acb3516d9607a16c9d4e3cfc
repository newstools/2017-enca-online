I m really comfortable this week, I must say, said Otto during the course of the tournament. It s nice to be back after a year of injury. He reached the halfway mark at seven-under and then stayed in contention with his third-round of two-under-par 70. He threatened the top of the leaderboard in the final round as he carded a three-under-par 69, despite starting with a bogey and making another on the 15th. I m putting well this week and I m hitting the ball nicely, he said, and I m actually a bit more patient this week. That always helps. African News Agency

KABUL - In a country where attitudes towards gender roles were extremely conservative, a group of women were defying the odds and redrawing the media landscape.With the launch of a new magazine and a television channel they risked the anger of extremists by giving their gender a glamorous voice.The teams behind the two privately-run projects had bold ambitions to use their mass media platforms to change attitudes and inform Afghans of their rights.But they knew full well the dangers of such trailblazing ventures in the war-torn nation."(The) lack of participation of women in life has made this country very violent," said Sandjar Sohail, head of the Hasht press group behind the launch of "Gelara" magazine.READ: Foreign delegations meet in Afghan capital after bloody week"I am sure we'll get some reaction, some complaints. We are expecting that," he conceded.The glossy monthly run by a team of women in their 20s proclaims itself proudly as "Afghanistan's first fashion magazine".Gelara - translated as "the apple of the eyes" in Farsi was a colloquialism for something beautiful and precious and the magazine contained culture and celebrities, but aimed for pedagogy.Beauty, cooking, health, literature: the magazine succumbed to feminine tropes, but also dived into issues such as family law reform, which had stalled in the Afghan parliament since 2008."This family law is so unfair for women... once they get married they have no rights. You have to push for women's rights," insists the editor-in-chief, 24-year-old Fatana Hassanazada, who headed a team of 14 young women.'It's always risky' Gelara's first cover featured singer Mozhdah Jamalzadah, who posed bareheaded, her bold gaze staring directly into the camera.In an interview, the artist discussed criticism she received for wearing costumes judged too tight.Afghan pop star and women's rights activist Aryana Saeed underwent a similar deluge after a recent concert in Paris."Yes it's risky. It's always risky" in Afghanistan to fight conservatism and extremism, said Sohail, who also runs the country's most popular newspaper, 8-Subh (8-Hours)."This is a life and death conflict," he explained, adding they have no choice but to fight."If not, the conservatives will bring us back, to a primitive life."READ: War-torn Kabul becomes a protected site for migratory birdsZan TV, or "Women's TV", also aimed to challenge traditional expectations of the female role in Afghanistan, when it expected to begin broadcasting in the near future.Women were already on the air in Afghanistan and regularly presented the news.But at Zan TV they would have power.Mehria Afzal, 25, the head of the political service, expected it to be "the voice of Afghan women.""In the provinces, girls are exchanged like animals. It is forbidden, but they do not know their rights," she asserted.READ: Afghan idols show breaks barriersGiving women the (remote) control"This is the first time that we have launched a television project dealing with the issues of Afghan women, covering all subjects, allowing women to express themselves whether it is politics or religion," said Malalai Zikria, the channel's editorial advisor."Every woman or girl who has something to say will be welcome," she promised.Rape, harassment, contraception - all would be discussed, even the very sensitive question of virginity, she said.But the presenters would wear their headscarfs, she said, underscoring the caution with which they are attempting to move forward."We are in an Islamic country, we must respect the laws. We can be veiled and fight for (our) rights."AFP

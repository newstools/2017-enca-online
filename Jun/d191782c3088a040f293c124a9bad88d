The office of the Public Protector appears to have either effectively ignored or misunderstood Absa s detailed submissions, which were made to it on two occasions. A copy of our February 2017 submission has been released to the public, the statement read.She s also called for Constitutional amendments, suggesting the nationalisation of banks.

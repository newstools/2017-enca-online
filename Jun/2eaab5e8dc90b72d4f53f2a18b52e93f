Two other people were seriously injured, including a seven-year-old boy, who was also left in a coma but is now recovering.Some of the injuries occurred after a railing around the entrance to an underground car park beneath the square gave way, causing some of those injured to fall up to two metres (nearly seven feet). Erika was crushed against a wall, and the compression of her rib cage caused a heart attack that led to brain damage, the media reported.Juventus supporter dies following Turin fanzone stampede https://t.co/KKiR0IzvyA pic.twitter.com/HTdzCM5WbGThe mayor of Turin, Chiara Appendino, said in a tweet that "words were insufficient" to describe the death, and that the city would officially observe mourning on the day of her funeral.The Italian authorities opened an investigation for involuntary bodily harm immediately after the incident, which will now be upgraded to involuntary homicide.AFP

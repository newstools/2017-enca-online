The motive for the stoning is not yet clear, but it appears some commuters did not have tickets to board the train and when the two protection services officials confronted them they stoned them," the union said in a statement. Satawu expressed its sympathies to the members families. "The two officials were employed to ensure commuters were safe from petty criminals like pickpockets while at the station. Ironically, it is the same people they were employed to protect who turned on them," it said.Satawu said this was the second incident of this nature to occur in three years, although regular violent attacks on train drivers by commuters had been reported in recent times. "We appeal to Prasa to take the safety of its staff to heart bearing in mind that the majority are breadwinners responsible for the livelihood of extended families."The rail agency should launch a commuter education campaign and a tip-off mechanism through which law-abiding commuters and other citizens could anonymously give information that might assist in the apprehension of culprits.eNCA

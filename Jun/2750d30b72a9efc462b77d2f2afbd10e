At a general council meeting in Mogale City, the ANC West Rand region endorsed Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to become the party's next president.READ: Phosa in the running to lead the ANCSpeakers emphasised the importance of electing leaders who would inspire confidence among voters.Mashatile said: At a conference in 1991, president Oliver Tambo, among others, said: 'I have led this organisation for over 30 years. I now hand it over to you much bigger and stronger.' Can we say that today?"That s a problem. The ANC today is no longer stronger. It might be bigger because we have members out there, but the strength of any organisation must be rooted among the masses of our people."And we must begin to say, 'Why are we no longer as strong as when OR Tambo gave the organisation to us?' It s because we are not listening to the people. We ve got a lot of leaders who are arrogant, who think people don t care, and that s what is weakening the African National Congress, Mashatile said. eNCA

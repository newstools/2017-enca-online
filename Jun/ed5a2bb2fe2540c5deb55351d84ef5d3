WASHINGTON Facebook's artificial intelligence researchers announced Wednesday they had broken new ground by giving automated programs or "bots" the ability to negotiate, and make compromises.

Simply put, negotiation is essential, and good negotiation results in better performance."But the bots can also find ways to be sneaky.

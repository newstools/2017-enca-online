OSTRAVA - The programme for the 56th edition of the Golden Spike, a IAAF World Challenge event in Ostrava Czech Republic on Wednesday night, includes the sprint hurdles events for both men and women.On the men s side the spotlight will rest firmly on South African Antonio Alkana who lowered the African record to 13.11 in Prague on June 5. The African champion will take on Garfield Darien of France and Hungary s Balazs Baji.On the women s side, Germany s Pamela Dutkiewicz is the class of the women s field, who ll arrive undefeated in six competitions outdoors this season.READ: Alkana breaks African and South African records at Prague meetThe 25-year-old improved to 12.61 in Weinheim one month ago and since took victories in Hengelo, Oslo and the European Team Championships on Sunday.Elsewhere on the infield, neutral athletes Anzhelika Sidorova at 4.75m and Olga Mullina at 4.67m along with Alysha Newman of Canada at 4.71m top the field in the women s pole vault.The field in the men s high jump includes four men who ve topped 2.30m this year: Pole Sylwester Bednarek, Majd Eddin Ghazal of Syria, Tihomir Ivanov of Bulgaria and Mateusz Przybylko of Germany.The fastest in the women s 1 500m field are Gudaf Tsegay of Ethiopia and Rabab Arrafi of Morocco, with 4:01.42 and 4:01.75 season s bests.And in the 200m, Marie Josee Ta Lou of Cote D Ivoire will be the woman to beat.Champions from the Rio 2016 Olympic Games also figure prominently on the middle and long distance programme, among them two-time Olympic champion Kenyan David Rudisha who will be making his career debut over 1 000m.READ: High-flying Alkana keeps his feet on the groundTesting himself in off distances isn t anything new for Rudisha who last season in his run-up to a successful Olympic 800m title defence broke the African record over 600m at the Birmingham leg of the IAAF Diamond League, clocking 1:13.10.But going up in distance is uncharted territory for the 28-year-old, who famously broke his own 800m world record in the 2012 Olympic final.He hasn t disclosed any time targets, but a reasonable test of form would be an assault on the meeting record of 2:15.08 set by Ilham Tanui Ozbilen of Turkey in 2014, the fastest time that year over the rarely-run distance.Kenyan Nicholas Kipkoech, who arrives with 1:43.37 and 2:16.68 credentials over 800m and 1 000m from last year, and Ryan Gregson, this year s Australian 1 500m champion, should prove Rudisha s primary challengers.African News Agency

JOHANNESBURG - Sibanye Gold said on Monday that 202 illegal miners had been arrested at its Cooke operations southwest of Johannesburg since the start of a violent wildcat strike a week ago.Sibanye said the strike, during which more than a dozen miners were allegedly assaulted by those striking, was triggered by a company drive to root out illegal miners, which has included the arrest of employees for collusion and taking food down to illegal miners working underground.Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines, and Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners from its shafts by January 2018.READ: Sibanye Gold shareholders score R1.3bn as platinum price soarsA company spokesman said on Monday the entire Cooke operation would remain closed for the rest of the week as the firm assessed the security situation."We will review the situation again closer to the weekend," the spokesman said.The illegal miners arrested have been forced to come to the surface because of the strike, which has emptied the shafts of employees, thereby starving them of their sources of food and water underground - an unintended consequence of the stoppage.READ: Sibanye Gold plans layoff of platinum minersSibanye's Cooke site appeared quiet on Monday, with the road to the Cooke 1 and 2 shafts blocked off by a chain strung along three barrels."Everyone has gone home," a local union source told Reuters.The Cooke operations are situated in the working class town of Westonaria, about 40 kilometres outside Johannesburg.Reuters

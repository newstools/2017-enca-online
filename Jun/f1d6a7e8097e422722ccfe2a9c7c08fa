BOIPATONG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema challenged the youth to be innovative and to take a stand against any form of injustice like the class of 1976.Malema was speaking at Boipatong Stadium on Friday as the party commemorated Youth Day.Malema - The youth of 1976 had to act because their parents had given up. #YouthDay #EFFYouthDay pic.twitter.com/b97lsEGNlf We want to support youth ideas. In Johannesburg the DA is ruling there because of the EFF's support. If you have a nice idea bring it here, Johannesburg will finance it by force. We will support youth innovation. If you have something unique Tshwane will finance it because the EFF is the one that made it possible for the DA to be in power in Tshwane. We are for the black child. We want to support black children, said Malema.During his address, Malema praised the class of 76 and the community of Boipatong for contributing towards collapsing the apartheid regime.He lambasted the ANC government for lack of development in Boipatong, an area where 39 people were brutally killed in 1992 as political violence flared up.Malema - the ANC government has forgotten about the people of Boipatong. #YouthDay #EFFYouthDay pic.twitter.com/tO4j1fgHAt We salute you, the people of Boipatong. We came here because you must be honoured. We came here because we want them to remember Boipatong. We want them to know that this is not just a place where black people reside. This is a place where the struggle against the murderous regime was inspired, said Malema.EFF leader Julius Malema dancing at Boipatong Stadium. #YouthDay #EFFJune16 pic.twitter.com/TYMaEiSBSyMbuyiseni Ndlozi at Boipatong Stadium for #EFFYouthDay Commemoration. pic.twitter.com/BbyoLqcWUpeNCA

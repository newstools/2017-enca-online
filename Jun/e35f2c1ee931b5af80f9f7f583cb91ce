KZN - A social media blackout campaign kicked off on Wednesday, protesting against the high price of data in the country.Social media users want the major mobile networks to drop their prices.Advocacy group, the Right2Know campaign, said it supported the social media blackout, which is a continuation of the Data Must Fall campaign started by DJ Tbo Touch. Right2Know KZN Spokesperson Phezu Ntetha said, The state is being monopolised by the 3 major networks and it is making it difficult for communities, especially poor ones, to access information and to have a space for freedom of expression. So the high cost of data is also limiting on those constitutional provisions, the access to information and freedom of expression .READ: Competition Commission to probe high data costsBut the campaign, in which social media users were asked to stay off popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Whastapp. failed to gain much traction, with the campaign ironically trending on social media. The campaign was meant to shut out social media for the day. Instead, it lit it up. By 6am on Wednesday, the hashtag, social media blackout, was the number one trending topic on Twitter. Oops!World Wide Worx Founder Arthur Goldstuck said, "You're asking people to stop talking to each other or to express their view points because social media is where people talk to each other or use as a platform to express views or to be themselves for a day data has fallen for the wealthy and If those ignoring social media are on prepaid, the blackout is not going to have a big impact on the networks." The plan was to run the blackout campaign every Wednesday, but that seems unlikely considering its limited success.*View the attached video for more on this story. eNCA

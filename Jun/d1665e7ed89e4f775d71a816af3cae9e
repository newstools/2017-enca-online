The scorer, has been a corner stone of several Leopards playoff campaigns in recent years, and is one of the midfielders of the home team that looks quite capable of playing at a higher level.In the 64th minute, Leopards received a lifeline, when Matome Kgoetyane brought down Lebogang Mabotja in the penalty area, and Siphelele Ntshangase scored from the spot. Despite Leopards continued onslaughts on the Baroka goal, a further goal was not to be, with the Baroka defence holding firm.Visiting team goalkeeper Avhashoni Tshinuna completed the match in pain, as he nursed a leg injury, but the Leopards strikers were not able to make him move or stretch to the maximum to force the error.Baroka, who finished 15th in the 16-team Absa Premiership, now join an elite group of clubs including Mpumalanga Black Aces, Amazulu and Polokwane City, who have managed to save their top flight status, through the playoffs competition.African News Agency

WASHINGTON Scientists discovered a rare 115-million-year-old mushroom fossil that sprouted during the era of the dinosaurs, the oldest such specimen found by far.The five centimetre fungus, which was similar to its distant contemporary descendants, was found in Brazil, then part of the supercontinent Gondwana.The enormous landmass later broke up to form South America, Africa, Antarctica, India and Australia.READ: Modern humans evolved 100,000 years earlier than we thought Studying the fossil under an electron microscope, scientists found that the ancient mushroom had gills under its cap as well as spores, which helped identify fungus species, said Sam Heads, a palaeontologist with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.The scientists called the specimen Gondwanagaricites magnificus in a nod to its place of origin.After falling into a river, possibly during a flood, the fungus was carried into a lagoon where it was buried under sediment and fossilised, a scenario backed up by fossils of insects and plants found at the same location.The water in the lagoon was likely salty and contained little oxygen, which helped preserve the mushroom, according to Heads."The fact that this mushroom was preserved at all is just astonishing," he said. "Most mushrooms grow and are gone within a few days."Mushrooms' soft, fragile structures decayed rapidly, making the chances of fossilisation extremely low, he said.Although fossilised remains of fungal filaments dating back hundreds of millions of years were previously discovered, only 10 whole fossilised mushrooms were found, the oldest of which dated back 99 million years.All those mushrooms were fossilised in amber.READ: Dino ancestors looked like crocodiles: studyFungi evolved before land plants and were responsible for their transition from an aquatic environment, the scientists said.When Gondwanagaricites magnificus were growing, the very first flowering plants were appearing, undergoing major evolution, Heads said."There were dinosaurs stomping around, pterosaurs flying around in the sky [and] lots of different fauna."AFP

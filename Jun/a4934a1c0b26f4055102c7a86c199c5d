Chairperson of the EC ANC Phumulo Masualle says delegates must reflect on proposals to make lives better in the rural areas #ANCPolicy pic.twitter.com/hgAFowKRpg As far as I can see these Guptas are also in power at the same level as the ANC. South Africa voted for the African National Congress not the Guptas. Anybody who embraces the Guptas within the ANC - we need to reprimand that person, said NEC member Fikile Xasa.While the battle over policy continues, the focus was also on organisational renewal.In particular, delegates will consider the proposed reduction of the NEC, to ensure quality not quantity. I can tell you it's one of those ideas that have been thrown and definitely the conference is going to consider that and look at the various options also with the understanding that what are the challenges facing the ANC.

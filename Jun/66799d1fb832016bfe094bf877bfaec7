We want that to stop," Robert Cyglicki, the director of Greenpeace Polska, said Saturday as thousands of protesters marched through the heart of the Polish capital."I've come with, and for, my six-month-old son, to preserve Bialowieza for him, to stop this barbaric logging," Olga Matuszewska, a 37-year-old filmmaker, told AFP as she pushed a pram with her son, Stefan. #Forest reproductive material guidelines: 2nd working group meeting in #Warsaw @euforgen #genetics #climatechange https://t.co/YpmInAjfqi pic.twitter.com/qigDdTVQeV"We need trees for clean air; the lumber's not worth it , it's not worth turning everything into money."Activists began chaining themselves to logging equipment in Bialowieza in May in a bid to halt the mass felling of trees.In late April, the European Commission gave Polish authorities a "final warning" to address its concerns about the forest or face being summoned by the EU's top court.People take part in a demonstration against massive logging in Bialowieza primeval forest (Puszcza), in Warsaw, Poland, on June 24, 2017.

The forest gained the coveted "natural heritage" label in 2011. Szyszko also backed a separate law passed in January allowing homeowners to cut down trees on their property without requesting permission.As many as three million trees could have been felled across Poland under the new law Zbigniew Karaczun, a researcher at Warsaw University of Life Sciences, told the Saturday edition of the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza daily.AFP

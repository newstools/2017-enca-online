JOHANNESBURG Lock Eben Etzebeth scored a try that epitomised the revival of South Africa following their disastrous 2016 as the Springboks made a clean-sweep of their three-match home series with France with a 35-12 victory at Ellis Park on Saturday.Etzebeth, captaining the side after the late withdrawal of number eight Warren Whiteley, completed an excellent set-piece move to go with scores from centre Jesse Kriel, hooker Malcolm Marx and scrumhalf Rudy Paige. Towering above. #LoveRugby #SA2023 pic.twitter.com/TUBMoBTWCq All of France s points came via the boot of flyhalf Jules Plisson, who kicked four penalties as they struggled against the physicality of the home side in an error-strewn performance.The victory is a first ever for the Boks over France in five tests at Ellis Park, and comes after they lost eight of their 12 tests last year in what was the worst season in the country s history. Congratulations to South Africa, beating France 35-12 to clinch @CastleLagerSA 3-0. Well done to all involved @MTNza @ASICS_ZA @FlySafair pic.twitter.com/yJC60VI6WX Reuters

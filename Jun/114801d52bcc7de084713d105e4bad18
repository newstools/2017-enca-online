JOHANNESBURG - The South Gauteng High Court has granted President Jacob Zuma leave to appeal a ruling that he must hand over records explaining his controversial Cabinet reshuffle. Judge Bashier Vally said although he did not believe there was any prospect of success, the president might have compelling reasons for not wanting to disclose why he went ahead with the reshuffle. In the late-night reshuffleÂ in March Zuma axed Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas from the ministry. Other ministers were also removed. READ: Cabinet reshuffle didn't weaken the rand: Gigaba A controversial intelligence report was reported to have informed the reshuffle. The DA filed court papers to force the president to make his reasons for the move and Vally ruled in the party's favour. But on Friday he granted the president leave to appeal that ruling. eNCA

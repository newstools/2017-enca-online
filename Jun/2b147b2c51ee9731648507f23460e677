CAPE TOWN - Imam Rashied Omar has called on the South African’s to unite against state capture and corruption. WATCH: We need to get rid of corrupt people within our government: Ramaphosa In his Eid address at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town on Monday, Omar urged the Muslim community to participate in social justice activism to root out the rot in government. “It is palpable that our country’s corruption dilemma is much more than President Zuma, the Guptas and state capture. In fact, it would be naïve to think that we are simply faced with a political crisis of leadership when it’s obvious that the situation goes much deeper.” The imam said civil society needed to be more united in its critique of the state. “We should be critical of those who have joined the bandwagon for Zuma to resign only because their capitalist self-interests are under threat. In this regard, it is important to call out the selective outrage of many South Africans and liberal activists.” READ: Leave no stone unturned in state capture probe: Ramaphosa He said the country’s problems would not be solved by politicians. “The critical motor of social change does not lie in the support of any political party, politician or candidate president but rather in a robust, independent, well-organised civil society that holds those in power accountable for their political and moral mandates.” Omar has called for better governance from the new crop of leadership that would emerge by the end of the ANC’s December elective conference eNCA

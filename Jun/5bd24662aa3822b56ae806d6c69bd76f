GABORONE - Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana on Tuesday suspended poultry imports from South Africa with immediate effect following outbreaks of highly contagious H5N8 bird flu.South Africa has confirmed outbreaks of avian flu, which is often transmitted by wild birds, on at least two farms.READ: Massive cull planned as new case of bird flu reportedSouth Africa and Mozambique banned poultry imports from Zimbabwe this month after a bird flu outbreak there.Botswana, which imports only five percent of its poultry needs, said it would no longer buy poultry meat, processed products and feeds from South Africa."The restriction is a precautionary measure to avoid equal infection here as well as protect our people," agriculture minister Patrick Ralotsia told Reuters.Zimbabwe imposed a similar ban, while Namibia also halted imports from Belgium, which experienced an outbreak of bird flu earlier this year.South Africa stopped the sale of live hens throughout the country on Monday in a bid to control the outbreak on the farm of a commercial broiler breeder last week.Poultry producer Astral, which had previously confirmed that H5N8 had been detected at its breeding facilities on the outskirts of the Free State, said on Tuesday it had quarantined the affected site and culled 150,000 birds, about six percent of its breeding stock.Reuters

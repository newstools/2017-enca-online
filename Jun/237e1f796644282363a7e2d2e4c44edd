JOHANNESBURG - Coastal Sharks and Springboks fly-half Patrick Lambie is unlikely to play again this year because of recurring concussion injuries, his provincial team said Tuesday. The 26-year-old had been expected to challenge Elton Jantjies and Handre Pollard for the No. 10 jersey in the three-match Test series against France, which ended last weekend.But a second concussion injury this year ruled him out as the resurgent Springboks completed a 3-0 whitewash over Les Bleus.Pollard was also injured before the Tests, leaving Jantjies to play a star role as South Africa got back on the winning trail after a calamitous eight-loss 2016 season.

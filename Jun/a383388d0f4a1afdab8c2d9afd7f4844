The party alleges R17-billion was stolen from the state-owned company. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, President Jacob Zuma and the Gupta family are some of the individuals implicated in the scandal.

Malema: We have opened a case against Zuma, Gigaba & Gupta crooks who stole R17b in Transnet pic.twitter.com/i1DatQ3xmH The minister’s spokesman Mayihlome Tshwete said Gigaba considers it ironic that some of those who are now fighting state capture, were themselves once accused of corruption. Tshwete was referring to allegations of corruption Malema faced involving tender irregularities, said to have contributed to Limpopo's financial woes. Despite an exhaustive investigation, Malema was never prosecuted. The charges were eventually struck from the roll.

BASSETERRE, Saint Kitts and Nevis - Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai won the toss and chose to bat first against the West Indies in the final fixture of the three-match T20 International series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.After comfortable victories in the first two matches, the home has retained an unchanged 11 in pursuit of a whitewash of the series before the teams turn their attention to the three One-Day Internationals in St Lucia beginning on Friday.Afghanistan have been a disappointment so far in this brief campaign, especially in the batting department, and are again fielding two changes from the previous match.Javed Ahmadi replaces Samiullah Shenwari in the batting line-up while left-arm seamer Shapoor Zadran returns to the team at the expense of namesake Dawlat.Teams: West Indies Carlos Brathwaite (captain), Evin Lewis, Chadwick Walton (wicketkeeper), Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Jason Mohammed, Rovman Powell, Sunil Narine, Jerome Taylor, Samuel Badree, Kesrick WilliamsAfghanistan Asghar Stanikzai (captain), Javed Ahmadi, Gulbadin Naib, Noor Ali Zadran, Mohammad Nabi, Karim Janat, Shafiqullah Shafaq (wicketkeeper), Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan, Shapoor Zadran, Amir HamzaUmpires: Joel Wilson (TRI), Leslie Reifer (BAR)Match Referee: Jeff Crowe (NZL).AFP

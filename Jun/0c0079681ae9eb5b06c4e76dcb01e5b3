Some of the postmortems have to be performed on bodies that have been in the mortuaries for more than a week. I am concerned, however, that police have not been able to provide sufficient protection to doctors to enable them to perform the autopsies, said Bloom.Mortuaries in Diepkloof, Hillbrow, Germiston and Roodepoort were seriously affected by the strike action, he said.The two-week long strike by workers across mortuaries in Gauteng has delayed the release of postmortem results and burials as bodies remain stuck at the mortuaries.The provincial department of health said talks with labour continued in a bid to end the crippling strike.eNCA

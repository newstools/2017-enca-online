"It may not be wise for the ANC leadership to always dismiss these killings as pure criminality that may not be motivated by some political issues," warned Mdumiseni Ntuli, ANC spokesperson in the region. Approximately thirty cases were murder cases but a total of 58 cases have been reported to us that are being investigated by the investigative task team that has been established," police spokesperson Vish Naidoo.The ANC in the province has now called on President Jacob Zuma to set an inter-ministerial team to oversee the probe."It may very well be necessary that the national leadership also considers assembling a team of ministers from the security cluster who should also provide political guidance and political leadership in the course of this investigation," Ntuli said.The ANC said if it emerged its members were involved in the killings, it would not hesitate to expel them.eNCA

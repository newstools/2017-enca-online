The virus is the same strain as the initial case reported, but the two farms are not directly linked, meaning this is a separate introduction."The farm has been placed under quarantine. More than 25,000 of the infected birds will be culled. Eggs are not allowed to move out of the farm, spokesperson Bomikazi Molapo said in a statement.READ: South African farmers urged to check poultry for bird fluThe sale of hens and roosters has been banned across the country. The ban of live hens (including roosters) is still in place, to enable the department to assess the extent of the outbreak.

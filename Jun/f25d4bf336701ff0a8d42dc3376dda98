What a wonderful performance! said Aleck Skhosana, the president of Athletics South Africa. Looks like Wade is on the roll here. Since announcing that he wants to contest the short sprints seriously this year, he has been on an onslaught. Clearly, he is not where we all want him to be, but he is really doing very well. The exploits of Simbine cannot go unnoticed. His consistency has made everyone sit up and worry about what s coming at the IAAF World Championships in August.

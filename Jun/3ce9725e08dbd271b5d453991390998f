JOHANNESBURG - The Chamber of Mines has applied for an urgent court interdict to stop the revised Mining Charter from being implemented.It argues that in its current form the charter will destroy the mining sector. WATCH: Economist weighs in on the new mining charterThe revised charter raises the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies from 26- to 30 percent, and gives companies 12 months to meet the target.The chamber says in court papers that Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane infringed on Parliament's powers when he published the charter.The chamber says its opposition to the charter should not be seen as an objection to transformation of the sector.Chamber of Mines spokesman Tebello Chabana said: This charter is going to have a tremendously negative effect on the mining sector. Just on the 15th of June we had R51-odd-billion being lost through mining shares."Remember that 60% of shareholders in the mining sector are actually South African citizens. So the big losers are those people whose investments are via the PIC [Public Investment Corporation]. The negative impact relating to this charter will continue. There are a lot of things that we re worried about in terms of the impact of this charter. eNCA

DURBAN Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane will lead a Youth Day march to the Phoenix police station in eThekwini in Kwazulu-Natal on Friday.In a statement on Friday morning, the DA said stronger action needed to be taken by government and the police service to tackle drug abuse and crime among the youth.The DA said it would call for the reintroduction of specialised police units to target specific crimes. The fact that there has been a 325% increase in drug and gang-related crime since the Narcotics Bureau was disbanded in 2004 highlights the desperate need for specialised units to ensure that those who sell drugs to our young people are put behind bars, the party said.Maimane will hand over a memorandum to police detailing the party s demands to end crime among the youth.The march will start at 10am at Chartford Sports Ground, Corner of Chartford Drive and Avonford Crescent, Phoenix, and end at the Phoenix police station.African News Agency

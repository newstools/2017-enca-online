BRUSSELS - Brussels fine-dining is soaring to dizzying heights, with adventurous foodies given a chance to eat a meal in the clouds.Created 11 years ago in Brussels by David Ghysels, Dinner in the Sky has now expanded to around 60 countries across the world.This year in Brussels, it is located in front of the 'Cinquantenaire,' a public park with buildings commissioned by King Leopold II to mark Belgium's 50 years of independence. Once there, diners, chefs and kitchen staff are lifted 40 metres (130 feet) into the air by a crane.Guests are strapped into their chairs at their designated tables with 21 other diners and lifted until the Brussels skyline is in view. Once they reach the highest point, they dine on dishes created by renowned Belgian chefs who prepare one lunch and two dinners per day.One of the chefs, Bart De Pooter, owns Michelin-starred restaurant De Pastorale in Reet near the harbour city of Antwerp.De Pooter offered a five-course meal that included Holstein beef with peas, asparagus with wild garlic and leek gravy, as well as lettuce seasoned with buckwheat and ginger. The dishes were accompanied by premium wines and champagne.He told Reuters TV the proximity to the diners made the experience different from working in a restaurant kitchen.The guests, who each paid 285 euros ($320) for a seat on the dinner table, were enthusiastic about the meal and the unique view over the Belgian capital.Diners can take to the skies until June 18. This amazing restaurant is in Belgium - How about having a dinner in the sky. pic.twitter.com/xDjWBzGDnbReuters

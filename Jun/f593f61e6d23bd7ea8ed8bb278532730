LOS ANGELES - The medical benefits of marijuana, or dagga as it is called in South Africa, did not just extend to humans. Man's four-legged, furry friends could also be helped.In Los Angeles, it was early morning, just after breakfast, and six-year-old Cayley was wide awake, eagerly anticipating her daily dose of cannabis.The black Labrador, tail wagging, lapped up the liquid tincture that owner Brett Hartmann squirted into her mouth, a remedy he used morning and evening to help alleviate Cayley's anxiety."Ever since I started her on CBD (cannabidiol -- a marijuana extract), her separation anxiety has disappeared," said Hartmann of his pet, a service dog he acquired while in college because he had epilepsy.READ: Israel to relax marijuana lawsHartmann said he turned to medical marijuana for Cayley after he no longer needed her to accompany him everywhere, having himself overcome his epilepsy with the help of the drug."I just allowed her to retire and... I don't think she handled the transition too well," Hartmann, who also had his ageing dachshund on cannabis, said."But CBD has really helped."With the multi-billion dollar medical and recreational marijuana industry for humans blossoming in the United States, so was a new customer base -- animals."We are seeing about 20 percent growth every single month," said Alison Ettel, founder of Treat Well, a company in California that specialised in non-psychoactive medical cannabis products for animals and humans.Treating thousands of animals She said owners of animals -- from dogs, cats, lizards, turtles, alpacas, horses to farm animals -- were increasingly turning to cannabis to help treat ailments ranging from cancer and heart murmurs to arthritis and ear infections.And the feedback, Ettel said, was more than encouraging.WATCH: Dagga now legal at home"We are probably get at least one to five cancer patients a day and the results we're seeing are just blowing my mind," she said, claiming the drug could help improve life expectancy.But despite the rush to cash in on the booming industry, cannabis remained illegal on the federal level and marijuana laws on the state level did not apply to pets.That translated into pet owners having to get a marijuana card for themselves in order to purchase cannabis for their pups, as veterinarians were barred from prescribing the drug.Does it really work?Proponents said the advantage of cannabis for ailing pets as opposed to painkillers or other traditional drugs was that when properly used, it had no known serious side effects."Other medicines can take a toll on an animal's kidney, liver and other organs," Hayes said.But some veterinarians were cautioning against viewing cannabis as a miracle drug."There are no studies on dogs or cats, much less guinea pigs or other species, so I don't know what the potential benefits could be, if any," said Ken Pawlowski, a veterinarian and head of the California Veterinary Medical Association.But pet owners like Hartmann are undeterred, while acknowledging that people need to be better educated on how to use the drug."We have so many success stories," said Hartmann, who works as a cannabis consultant."I have people who roll their eyes all the time and I say 'You're just going to have to see it to believe it.'"AFP

JOHANNESBURG - A 5-year-old South African girl who suffers from global development delay, blindness and other chronic medical conditions is set to be deported from New Zealand.A daily newspaper there has reported that a high court found in favour of Immigration New Zealand's decision to deport the little girl after her family appealed the move.Immigration NZ argued that the girl's medical conditions would prove a burden on the country's health system.This despite reportedly admitting that her "life chances generally would be far better if she were able to remain in New Zealand".Andrew Riches -- the family's lawyer -- said "sending her back to South Africa is just not an option for them (the family), it's just too dangerous".He said the family was now considering a further appeal or hoping Immigration NZ would alter its decision based on a change in circumstances."The girl had started making some good progress in New Zealand, and from what I understand, the South African system sees disabled people as a burden on society and wants to move them out of the way."- Additional reporting by the New Zealand Herald eNCA

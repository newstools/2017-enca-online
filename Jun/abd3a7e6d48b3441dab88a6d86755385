Johannesburg - School governing bodies must ensure that no religion gets a preference over another in public schools. The South Gauteng High Court made the ruling today, after an organisation focusing on religion in schools took three high schools and three primary schools to court. However the judge did not grant the order requested by the Organisation for Religion, Education and Democracy that none of South Africa's 71 religions be taught at schools. WATCH: Schools can't promote one religion, court finds According to the order, teachers are also not allowed to promote religious practices at school. "What is extremely important for us is that the authority of governing bodies in determining the religious observances, the rules for religious observances in schools has been confirmed," said Teresa Conradie from the Charter for Religious Rights and Freedom. "So those rules have to be equitable.” Trade union Solidarity says it's pleased with the judgment. "The thing that stood out is that they can’t exclude somebody, so they should go back to the drawing board and decide how they can go about not excluding certain persons or people in the school,” said Juran Van Den Heever from Solidarity. The court order is only applicable to public schools, and not private schools. So what does this mean in the classrom? eNCA's Joanne Joseph spoke to Dr Misheck Ndebele, a lecturer at the Wits School of Education.

It was back in 2015 and I ran a wind-assisted 13.42sec for the win. He says his record didn t come as that much of a surprise. I ve actually seen it coming this season, but I just didn t know when I ll run it. I knew I could do it as I do those times in training. But now I just have to stay focused and enjoy the rest of the season. On the race itself: It felt like it was a perfect race for me. I haven t looked at the video yet, but from the results, I see I can still work on my start a bit. Otherwise conditions were good, I had a perfect wind and couldn t ask for better.

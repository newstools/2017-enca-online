JOHANNESBURG - Insurance company Outsurance has caused a stir with its Father’s Day video that includes only one black man among the 20 dads featured. Mhmm is this the vid by Outsurance? Woow? In 2017 -- pic.twitter.com/rZoXBb1Pfb Twitter users laid into the company on Sunday for not representing South Africa's demographics. Well done to @OUTsurance who have managed to turn a celebration about fathers to a celebration of white men. How our Black African Dad's r looking at this outrageous Outsurance advert at the moment!!! Smh #FathersDay pic.twitter.com/btIqsEo2IQ Black dads must have been at work when this was shot. ----‍♀️ This doesn't accurately represent FATHERS of all races in South Africa. I have a feeling a lot of your clients will cancel on you tomorrow Or we can try this one? @OUTsurance what do you think? #FathersDay pic.twitter.com/YbNRbFr5RV Outsurance issued an apology, saying the scant inclusion of black fathers was an unintentional oversight. We apologise for our Father's Day video. It did not appropriately represent SA's demographics. It was an unintentional oversight. It removed the video from its Twitter account . Delete this... pic.twitter.com/URMcHoVIDS It is not the first time the company's videos have portrayed a lack of diversity. A Mother's Day video featured only white mothers and, as Twitter users pointed out, the company's ads once included an actor in black face. OUTsurance has been problematic, the was a white guy in black face ' Doloris' now this advert wow ------ pic.twitter.com/CNIit82ENC Told you'll a long time ago about @OUTsurance. This is how they see you!!! This is the only way they see us! pic.twitter.com/sQZikAqt9a ya'll made outsurance delete that ad.

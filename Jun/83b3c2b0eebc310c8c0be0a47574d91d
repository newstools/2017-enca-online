JOHANNESBURG, - Aspen Pharmacare said on Wednesday that it has not had any engagement with the Competition Commission about allegations of abusing its dominance by charging excessive prices in the provision of lifesaving cancer medicine in South Africa. Aspen was named among three pharmaceutical giants, including Roche Holding AG and Pfizer Inc, that the Competition Commission on Tuesday said it would be investigating for alleged excessive prices and price fixing, price discrimination, abuse of dominance, and abuse of patent laws. Aspen is also under investigation by competition authorities in various European countries for alleged excessive pricing. The Commission said it was of the view that Aspen appeared to be a dominant firm in the provision of the Leukeran, Alkeran and Myleran drugs in South Africa, and the only supplier of a generic version of busulfan in tablet form.

In a response on Tuesday, Aspen initially said it had “noted” the Commission’s announcement and that it was committed to full and constructive engagement in this investigation. Aspen said that pharmaceutical prices were approved by the Department of Health in terms of the Single Exit Price (SEP) regulatory framework which establishes a universal fixed price, and that it had not increased pricing of its products outside of this regulatory framework. The company said the supply of the oncology products in question was no exception. But on Wednesday, Aspen said it wanted to clarify the more key issues on the products listed by the Commission in its announcement, saying that these products were all post-patent and had been for some time now. “There are no obvious barriers precluding generic entry for these products. Invariably in situations like these, the lack of generic entry is either attributable to the sub-economical pricing of the branded products and/or an unattractive market size,” Aspen said. “Despite the lack of generic competition on these products, Aspen reiterates and emphasises that it has never increased the prices for these products in South Africa beyond the allowable SEP increases as gazetted by the South African Department of Health from time to time.” READ: Aspen off the hook for ARV exclusivity with Mylan Aspen said it hoped to demonstrate, through its active engagement with the Commission and other affected stakeholders, its ongoing commitment to supplying the South African market with quality affordable medicines. “To provide context to shareholders it is confirmed that, while Aspen fully acknowledges the vital nature of the four oncology products listed in the Commission’s announcement, these products have a collective turnover of about R3 million in the South African private market.” African News Agency

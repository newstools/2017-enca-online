JOHANNESBURG - Ahmed Timol's brother Mohammed was the family's fourth witness at the inquest into his death 42 years ago.Magistrate JL de Villiers ruled during an inquest in 1972 that Timol committed suicide by jumping out of the 10th floor of the infamous John Vorster Square, currently known as the Johannesburg Central police station.This new inquest has been fought for by his family for years.Mohammed Timol told the court how he was tortured for information about his brother, and couldn't even attend his funeral.After Timol died, the police claimed his death was guided by a Communist Party document that encouraged activists to commit suicide rather than betray their comrades.But Timol's brother denies such a document ever existed.Timol: I was never given an instruction to "committ suicide rather than betray other comrades". #TimolInquest pic.twitter.com/PVIkhmB0CZThe message was always "hang on for as long as you can and don't give any information" if you are detained #TimolInquestTimol says not once in his interrogation did he reveal that his brother had been to the Soviet Union for political education #TimolInquestTimol: Timol went to the Soviet Union with Thabo Mbeki among others for political education #TimolInquestHe say activists were trained to endure torture, and to never provide information to the enemy.As far as the court is aware, 3 of the 23 police officers who were involved in Timol s detention are still alive.

Naik: No, I was just released #TimolInquestNaik was arrested a day after Timol, but he says he never saw him while in detention, and only learnt of his death once he was released.He faced even worse punishment after his release, when some accused him of giving information to the police.Naik, ends by thanking the court for listening to his story, clarifying again that he was not a police informer #TimolInquest pic.twitter.com/3Z83mK8DsZeNCA

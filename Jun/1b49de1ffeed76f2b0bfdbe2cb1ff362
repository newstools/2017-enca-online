We sympathise with the taxi industry in this regard. It must, however, be emphasised that it is a matter between the industry and the SA taxi finance [company]. We have also been informed that the parties have since reached an agreement and as such we, therefore, call upon Santaco members to clear the roads so that the traffic flow can return to normal. We also want to apologise to commuters who are affected and encourage them to use other modes of public transport such as buses and trains. -Additional reporting by ANAeNCA

JOHANNESBURG A return to title contention is the incentive for the winner of the African Boxing Union and SA cruiserweight title fight between Thabiso Mchunu and Johnny Muller at Emperors Palace, near Johannesburg on Saturday.The pair headline the all-action Hurtin for Certain tournament that will be broadcast live on SuperSport 4 and 9 from 8.30pm.Mchunu is rebuilding after defeat in a championship shot against former Olympic champion Oleksandr Usyk.Muller is looking to work his way into the top 15 after winning, and then losing, against top 10-ranked Kevin Lerena.World Boxing Council vice-president, Houcine Houichi, will be ringside, with the winner all but guaranteed a place in the top 15 of the WBC.The bout offers a fascinating contrast in styles. From his side-on southpaw stance, the short, muscular Mchunu is fast and difficult to hit, using movement to dominate opponents.Muller is the archetypal brawler, a robust fighter who will press the action against Mchunu, the latter being priced by bookmakers as a narrow underdog.Simpiwe Konkco, the International Boxing Organisation (IBO) straw-weight champion, defends his belt against Lito Dante of the Philippines on the undercard.Dante comes from the streets of Valenzuela City and showed tremendous form in upsetting undefeated Jay Loto earlier this year.Word from Konkco s camp, however, is that he is in excellent shape and looking to make a big statement.Meanwhile knock-out specialist Thulani Mbenge, who has yet to go the distance in 10 professional fights, faces his toughest test against world number 15, Jay Inson, also of the Philippines.Mbenge is a dynamic talent with fast, heavy hands, but he will need to demonstrate intelligent boxing to get past Inson, who has no fears of fighting away from home, after upsetting a Japanese favourite in Japan recently.On the undercard, SA super-middleweight champion Lee Dyer and local contender Alfonso Tissen will be contesting the African Boxing Union (ABU) belt.

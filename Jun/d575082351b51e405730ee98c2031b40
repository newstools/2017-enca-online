NEW YORK - LCD Soundsystem, the New York electronic band that drew critical acclaim in the 2000s before a dramatic "final show," on Monday announced its return with a new album.The group said it would put out its fourth studio album, "This Is Happening," on September 1, a month after the surprise release of two tracks that will feature on it.The songs, "call the police" and "american dream," bring back the group's signature sound of electroclash guitar and mid-tempo synthesizer, led by frontman James Murphy's erudite, reference-heavy storytelling.LCD Soundsystem emerged amid a wave of indie rock in New York in the early 2000s but called it quits just as it was winning a fan base with tracks such as "All My Friends" and "Daft Punk Is Playing at My House."The group played a three-hour, sold-out show at Madison Square Garden in 2011 that it said would be its last. It turned the show into both a documentary and a live album called "The Long Goodbye."LCD Soundsystem reunited last year for a tour that included headlining the Coachella festival in California.The group announced a new US tour that will culminate in 10 shows in December at Brooklyn Steel, a new 1,800-capacity music venue in its home neighborhood of Williamsburg.

JOHANNESBURG - The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) has said it supports Tuesday s march by 10111 emergency call centre workers to the police minister s office in Pretoria in support of demands for better salaries.In a statement, Saftu said the 10111 call centre staff wanted to be paid on par with call centre operators in other spheres of government.Saftu said back in 2013, the 10111 staff met the then national police commissioner Riah Phiyega and the then Gauteng provincial police chief Lesetja Mothiba who has now been appointed interim acting national police commissioner to address members concerns regarding their salary level at the police call centre which is not on the same level as other government call centres, despite being the busiest emergency call centre with a with a high work load than the other government call centres .READ: Be patient when calling 10111: acting national police chiefAccording to Saftu, a task team was formed to benchmark 10111 staff salaries against other government call centres, including Home Affairs, Sassa, Sars, Crime stop and Presidential hotline call centres. It was completed on 30th April 2016 and the report was compiled and submitted to the Provincial office. The task team recommended on the report that the salary level at 10111 should be upgraded to salary level 7 (R226 211 p/a) which was also approved by the provincial management which includes the Provincial Commissioner. The Provincial Commissioner then sent the benchmarking report to the Acting National Commissioner General [Khomotso] Phahlane for approval. According to Saftu, a separate evaluation, completed in October last year made similar recommendations but police management later reneged on this, including possible regrading of posts to Constable level with a lower salary package.Saftu said the national commissioner s office only responded to various demands on May 17 with the same attitude that the posts will be converted to constable post as stated on the police act . The members of 10111 supported by SAFTU are therefore marching to the minister of police s offices on the 6th of June 2017 to voice out their dissatisfaction with the response from the Acting National Commissioner.

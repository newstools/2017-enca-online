NEW DELHI - Pregnant women in India were advised to stay away from meat, eggs and lust - drawing derision from health experts who slammed the tips as completely unscientific.The recommendations were contained in a booklet compiled by the government-funded Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy.Pregnant women must avoid "eggs, non-veg etc" and detach themselves from "desire" and "lust", said the booklet, extracts of which were published in Indian media."During pregnancy, women... should have spiritual thoughts, should read the life history of great personalities and should keep themselves in peace," it went on.READ: Indian politician arrested for illegal adoption ringDoctors said the advice bordered on ridiculous, especially in a country that recorded a staggering 45,000 maternal deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organisation.About 174 women died of pregnancy-related causes in India for every 100,000 live births, compared with just 14 in the United States."The dietary advice is not scientific at all."Advising to stay away from non-vegetarian food is ridiculous since malnutrition and anaemia are the biggest problems in our country," said Sharmila Lal, a gynaecologist."In fact, if women are used to 'non-veg' food, we encourage them to have it during pregnancy as it is a good source of protein and iron," she said.READ: Indian activists welcome top court ban on 'sterilisation camps'The ministry of Ayush, which promoted traditional healing practices, defended the booklet saying it only contained general guidelines based on the concepts of yoga and naturopathy.The diet plans were "based on clinical experience, simple naturopathy treatments and tips for remaining stress-free during pregnancy," it said in a statement.Critics of India's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said unscientific theories in healthcare were increasingly being floated in the name of tradition.Last month, a Hindu nationalist organisation said it was helping Indian couples conceive "superior" babies with high IQs and fair skin through a purification process rooted in ancient texts and mythology.AFP

JOHANNESBURG - The JSE closed weaker on Thursday as relentless selling hit the market for the second day this week despite the Constitutional Court ruling improving the prospects for the removal of President Jacob Zuma from his position.The court ruled that the speaker of Parliament has the powers to decide on whether a vote of no confidence should be by secret ballot or not. The exercise of that power must be duly guided by the need to enable effective accountability what is in the best interests of the people and obedience to the Constitution Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said.In reply to questions in Parliament earlier Zuma indicated it was important for Parliament to vote as it always had . That could open the door for an open vote as Speaker Baleka Mbete is a high-ranking ANC official. However further legal steps from opposition parties could be in the offing if Mbete does not properly motivate her decision. The weaker JSE on the day was not related to any event but was a continued knock-on effect from the March cabinet reshuffle and ratings agencies downgrade announcements said BHP Bernstein Stockbrokers portfolio manager Vasili Girasis.Girasis said there had been virtually no buying of stocks over the past few weeks from local or global investors. It has been quite bad for some stocks as global index investors are obliged to sell local stocks if their market cap falls below a certain level. He said it was particularly pronounced among gold shares such as Harmony and DRD Gold. We have also seen Brait lose 32% and ArcelorMittal 56% this year. Girasis said some shares were clearly oversold but there was no clear indication of what could drive them higher again.Analysts said the lower oil price may be supportive of some rebound in future. The fall in Brent crude will result in lower consumer inflation setting the scene for possible rate cuts later in the year. The big winners from the $10 drop in oil over the past month are likely to be countries such as Turkey and SA Capital Economics analysts said in a note.They said the Turkish lira and rand had been rare examples of emerging-market currencies that have strengthened against the dollar since the start of June.Brent crude has dropped 20% so far this year.

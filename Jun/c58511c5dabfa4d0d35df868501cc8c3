CAPE TOWN - Small Rooibos tea companies are feeling the pinch in their pocket, due to a monopoly in the marketThe Competition Commission has charged Rooibos Limited, South Africa's largest processor of the tea, with abuse of dominance. This comes after the company signed exclusionary contracts with farmers, limiting rooibos supply to its competitors.Producers like Khoisan Tea are feeling the financial strain, as a result of supply shortages, high demand for Rooibos and monopolisation of the market.This prompted the company to approach the Competition Commission.READ: Rooibos helps fight diabetes"Rooibos Limited, made in 2014, knowing or announced a price to the farmers, knowing there will not be enough Rooibos tea and went out to the farmers and guaranteed them for five years a contract to buy rooibos teas for a higher price," claims Peter Schulke from Khoisan Tea. "This left us in a very difficult situation because we could only buy rooibos at this new higher price."Schulke says his company has taken a knock over the last few years."This put us in a situation, then we thought what are we going to do. We managed this year, we managed it bad, we didn t make much profit, we didn t make profit, but we bought tea and we sold it to keep this company going."WATCH: SuzelleDIY - How to make Rooibos Rusks with Evita BezuidenhoutBut Rooibos Limited CEO, Martin Bergh, says the deal helped some farmers stabilise their sales. "We think they have come to the wrong conclusion and we don t think we are guilty of any transgression. We busy gathering legal advice and out legal people will be taking it further," He said.The Competition Commission says the monopoly is hampering the growth of smaller producers.READ: Rooibos on the rise"They locked in farmers in terms of supply, extended their contract from one years to five years.

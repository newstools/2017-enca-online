JOHANNESBURG - The JSE opened weaker on Thursday on lower resources as market focus was on the banking sector following Barclays plc s decision to sell a bigger chunk in Barclays Africa than previously announced.Barclays plc announced on Thursday morning it had sold 33.7% of Barclays Africa s issued share capital at a price of R132 per share after previously announcing it would sell 22%. This was due to strong investor demand the group said on Thursday morning.The significance of the sell-down is that Barclays plc would no longer be the controlling shareholder of Barclays Africa which now has a diverse shareholder portfolio the group said.Barclays plc has reduced its shareholding in Barclays Africa to 23.4% with a further 7% to be taken up by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) at a later date.That would mean both will have a roughly equal stake in Barclays Africa with additional shareholders based on a planned staff share scheme as well as a broad-based black empowerment scheme set to be announced later.At 9.41am Barclays Africa was up 2.12% to R141.94.

Joachim L w: "This is a team that never played together, we did a lot of work in 10 days. Do you expect it to be perfect?" pic.twitter.com/WbdgGTJT8E "That must be reviewed and sorted out, because in one year's time, when the World Cup is here, teams should not be stuck in traffic."It's not that you start an hour late, everything gets pushed back and on one occasion we ate at 10pm at night, which is far too late."Meanwhile, Chile had to come from behind to salvage a point against Australia in Moscow.After James Troisi put the Asian champions ahead on 42 minutes at Spartak Stadium, Chile replied through half-time substitute Martin Rodriguez on 67 minutes to advance as Group B runners-up.Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi insisted they hadn't underestimated Australia, who are heading home after their bid to edge the Copa America holders to second place fizzled out."That could have been a quarter-final in the World Cup, such was the level of this game," said Pizzi."We are happy to reach the semi-finals and reach that aim. Now we must refocus on our next ambition."Australia boss Ange Postecoglou regretted his side's missed opportunities."We wanted to get out of the group and we haven't, so we are disappointed," said Postecoglou."They (Chile) are a world class team, a fantastic team, and have played some of the best teams in the world off the park."We needed energy to face that and the guys who came in did a great job. From my perspective, it was a great performance."Century for CahillPostecoglou praised veteran forward Tim Cahill as Australia's captain made his 100th international appearance.

Cahill originally played youth international football for Samoa and was only cleared to feature for Australia after FIFA changed its eligibility rules in 2004."It's an unbelievable achievement to have played 100 games as he didn't play for Australia until he was 24, because he wasn't allowed to," said Postecoglou."He could have been sat here with 120, 130 games, very easily."Every time he has played at the highest level, at World Cups, he has scored goals. He is a fantastic influence."AFP

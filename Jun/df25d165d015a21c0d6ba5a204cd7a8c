JOHANNESBURG Somalia s Minister of Information, Abdirahman Omar Osman, has confirmed on Twitter that a leading al-Shabaab military commander has defected to Somali government forces.Bishar Mumin Farah surrendered on Wednesday in Hiran, in south-central Somalia.A Somali general who interviewed the defector told Voice of America (VOA) the Shabaab commander had been sent to Hiran, a large and populous area of central Somalia, in order to execute attacks during the holy month of Ramadan .READ: Kenyan forces kill 31 al-Shabaab militants in Somalia Farah handed over two AK-47 rifles and ammunition to government forces after leaving his camp around 1 am Wednesday, said General Mohamed Ahmed Tedrice. He is a young man who had been brainwashed but who eventually realised that Shabaab s activities were evil and that he no longer wanted to be a part of the militant group, the general said.One of the reasons for Farah s defection could be him contacting relatives, some of whom are government forces, shortly before his defection.Previously a number of rank-and-file members of Shabaab have surrendered, but Farah marks the first high-profile member known to have defected since April when President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo offered a two-month amnesty to members of the extremist group.Farah was the deputy commander of militias in Harardhere, in north-central Somalia in the Mudug region. Haradnere is the largest town controlled by the Islamists.Tredice said Farah had also been a deputy commander of Shabaab units in three other parts of the country in Hiran, the Middle Shabelle and Galgudud regions.The commander of the Somali army s 52nd Battalion said Farah s surrender clearly would be a setback for the militants. We welcomed him, he added, but we ll transfer him to the relevant government agencies, intelligence and the courts. Somali government forces, backed by African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) troops, have been battling Shabaab militants for years after the latter was previously able to control large swathes of the Horn of Africa country, including parts of the capital Mogadishu.However, AMISOM and government forces have successfully driven Shabaab out of the capital and into a few rural areas where they still control some territory.Nevertheless, the group remains a significant threat, able to carry out regular attacks on government forces and civilian targets, including in Mogadishu.The ongoing conflict has cost thousands of lives and displaced thousands more while Somalia s Christian minority have been repeatedly persecuted by the group.African News Agency

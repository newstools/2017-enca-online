NASREC - The ANC has beefed up security for its policy conference.Officials say they'll keep a tight grip on the venue.Nearly 5,000 people will fill the main hall at the Nasrec Expo centre close to Johannesburg from Friday.They'll be surrounded by a ring of steel. But the biggest concern could be inside the venue, right in the heart of the conference.ANC officials have called for calm, saying members shouldn't jump the gun ahead of its elective conference in December.They say this weekend's conference is specific to party policies."Nobody s going to be elected at this conference. Nobody s going to be removed at this conference. So whoever comes here must not think about issues of leadership. Leadership may be raised in the context of policies. Because we must have policies first. And then we can think about leadership," said ANC Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa. The party says members are free to protest.But they'll have to do it outside the gates, in a parking lot."We ve set up a speaker s corner in the parking lot, outside of the venue. People who wish to express their views which are contrary to the views of the ANC, may do so there. And we ve made available that kind of space for them to do so," said ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte. The ANC says it will check and double-check every single person who enters through the venue's gates. But security experts are warning that one mistake could throw the conference, and the country, into chaos.The party is confident it will keep any security threat at bay.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Sibanye Gold has fired around 1,500 workers for taking part in a wildcat strike at its Cooke mine.The decision, announced on Thursday, has prompted an angry reaction from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).Workers at the mine downed tools over a week ago, angered by a company drive to root out illegal miners.The campaign has resulted in the arrest of employees for collusion and taking food down to the illegal miners working underground.Illegal gold mining has plagued South Africa for decades, with bullion pilfered from both disused and operating mines.Sibanye has vowed it will clear all illegal miners - also known as 'Zama Zamas' from its shafts by January 2018.READ: More than 200 illegal miners arrested at Cooke mineThe Cooke mine employs close to 4,000 underground miners and Sibanye said the sacked workers could appeal their dismissals.Earlier, the NUM said nearly 2,000 miners were fired, including 1,100 of its members, who it said had been "wrongly dismissed."Sibanye said 793 NUM members had been sacked.The NUM said its members had been forced to take part in the strike in the face of coercion and intimidation from rival union the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).WATCH: How can the Zama Zamas be incorporated into the system?Last week 16 NUM members at Cooke were assaulted.Over 240 illegal miners have been arrested since the stoppage began.AMCU officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The illegal miners have been forced to come to the surface because of the strike, which has emptied the shafts of employees, thereby starving them of their sources of food and water underground - an unintended consequence of the strike.The Cooke mine, which is located in Randfontein, produces about 181,700 ounces of gold a year and brings in around R377-million in operating profit.

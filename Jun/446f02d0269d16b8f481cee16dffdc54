"South Africa believes that a people-centred development agenda, based on the recently adopted sustainable development goals (SDGs) should be the basis for addressing the myriad of challenges that confront nations across the globe, including those of peace and security."Nkoana-Mashabane also addressed the recent terror attacks across the world, including in Brics countries, saying this "made it necessary for South Africa to re-emphasise that terrorism in all its forms and from whichever quarter cannot be condoned.""We join the clarion call for the total isolation and eradication of all terror groups."They have no place among the community of nations."Further to this, the prevalent pockets of instability and insecurity scattered throughout the world, including our own African continent, remain a challenge."In order to overcome this, it is essential that we identify and consider an alternative narrative capable of tackling the complexity of these challenges."eNCA

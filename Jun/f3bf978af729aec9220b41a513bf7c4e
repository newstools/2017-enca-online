JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa urged members of health sector union Nehawu to make the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) succeed. "You must give it legs, you must give it the engine that it requires. You are the ones who are supposed to make sure that we deliver the best healthcare service for all our people. It is on your shoulders,” he told the union's 11th National Congress. The National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union was the first Cosatu-affiliated union to call for President Zuma to step down, in November last year. The union also levelled allegations against secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana, who has been placed on special leave until investigations into the allegations are completed. The union said it was clear that the revolution was taking a "disastrous" trajectory as it "needlessly lurches" from crisis to crisis. Nehawu has been at the forefront of various protests, most recently when workers affiliated to the union downed tools at Gauteng mortuaries. eNCA

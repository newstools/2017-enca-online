Behind the scenes glimpse of @ThulasSims and @XoliMngambi about to speak to @GwedeMantashe1 on #PolitBureau at #ANCPolicy17 pic.twitter.com/NC8iYZsBvgSince the 52nd ANC National Conference in Polokwane in 2007, the party experienced two breakaway groups and was besieged by slate politics at its elective conferences.Mantashe said the policy conference would test the party s unity. Once we become divided we become weaker. When we are united we become stronger and the essence of our weakness is our divisions, Mantashe said. If we don t address that issue we are going to be weaker, more and more, but if we come out of this policy conference more united then we are going to be much better because when are united we can deal with the challenges as a united force with our allies and we can defeat any challenge that faces us.

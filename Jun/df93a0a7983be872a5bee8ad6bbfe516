NEW YORK CITY - Rapper Jay-Z is known for drawing a thick curtain over his private life. But after a four-year gap, the artist has bared himself like rarely before on his new album. He apologises to his wife, superstar Beyoncé, for cheating and pours out his love for his mother, whom he reveals to be lesbian, all while taking familiar but timely shots on the politics of race. The 13th studio album by the rapper born Shawn Carter, 4:44, came out Friday as an exclusive on his upstart Tidal streaming service, whose new part-owners, telecom provider Sprint, are banking on the release to woo customers. Jay-Z - who has restored his name's hyphen - delivers a long-awaited public reply to Beyoncé who chastised him for infidelity on her acclaimed Lemonade album a year ago. "I apologise / Our love was one for the ages and I contained us," Jay-Z raps over a brassy Gospel refrain. "What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? You risked that for Blue?" he asks rhetorically, referring to the couple's five-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.

On the album, Jay-Z suggests they conceived the twins naturally. Discussing the album on iHeartRadio, he said 4:44 was named for the time of morning when he woke up and wrote the song. He and Beyoncé have matching ring-finger tattoos of the Roman numeral "IV" - four being the day in different months of their wedding and both their birthdays. Embracing lesbian mother Jay-Z, who recently became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, infuses the album with touches of house music and reggae, giving a sleeker, contemporary sound to the artist whose later albums had veered into mainstream pop. On the soulful "Smile," Jay-Z for the first time confirms hushed rumours that his mother is lesbian, explaining how she turned to substances to cope with the stigma. "Mama had four kids but she's a lesbian / Had to pretend so long, that she's a thespian," raps Jay-Z, who has spoken of how his father's absence contributed to his troubled youth in public housing in Brooklyn. "Don't matter to me if it's a him or her / I just want to see you smile through all the hate," he raps.

Jay-Z, like many rappers of his generation, employed homophobic slurs in his early music but was also one of the first prominent voices in hip-hop to speak out in favour of gay rights. Harsh words on Prince estate Jay-Z, who alongside Beyoncé campaigned for and became friends with former president Barack Obama, takes on race relations on "The Story of O.J." and "Moonlight" as he concludes that African Americans will invariably be judged by their colour. "We stuck in La La Land / Even when we win, we gonna lose," he quips about this year's Oscars mix-up in announcing best picture. Jay-Z elsewhere throws veiled barbs at other rappers including onetime protégé Kanye West, who last year ranted against Jay-Z and in support of then president-elect Donald Trump before entering a hospital.

The rapper denounces the "greedy bastards" who have commercialised Prince with moves such as bringing his catalogue onto leading streaming service Spotify. "I'm surprised you ain't auctioned off the casket," Jay-Z inveighs. But Jay-Z's mind on 4:44 is more on his own "legacy" - which is the title of the last song in which the 47-year-old addresses his children, vowing that the family's fortune and philanthropy will outlive him. "I'd like to see a nice peace fund / Ideas for people who look like we / We going to start a society within a society." AFP

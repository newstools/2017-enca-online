JOHANNESBURG The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) expressed concern on Friday about the culling methods being used to curb the outbreak of avian flu. READ: Neighbouring countries ban SA poultry "Animals are not commodities but sentient beings. If they are to be utilised for financial gain, every eventuality should be handled with the welfare of the birds being a priority. Birds which have been affected have already suffered the debilitating effects of the virus and have been caused further suffering through a cruel culling practice," the SPCA said in a ststement.Thousands of birds have been culled to prevent the spread of the H5N-8 virus after cases were reported on two South African farms.READ: Massive cull planned as new case of bird flu reported The animal rights group said it had told the government and the poultry association that the culling should be humane, but its requests had fallen on deaf ears.It praised one company for calling for its assistance to help end the suffering of 22,000 birds.However, it might take legal action against farms using a system called ventilation shutdown, where the air and water going into buildings in which chickens are kept are shut off and birds suffocate or overheat to death."Of the 10 methods prescribed for the mass slaughter of poultry in the case of disease outbreaks, this method is not one. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) are aware of this," the SPCA said.The government had been aware of outbreaks of bird flu in neighbouring countries and should have taken action sooner, the statement said.eNCA

He said he wanted to leave Port Elizabeth for a while, to go into hiding. Panayiotou then tells Siyoni that he should stop trying to contact him as his phone was being monitored by the police. "You've been phoning me all day and they're tracing my phone. Now you must destroy it. I have to tell them you're phoning me else they'll think I'm involved. You have to throw it away; the phone and the sim card my boy."Panayiotou goes on to speak to Siyoni about the murder. "These boys [the killers] made it big. I told you to let them do it outside the house and take the bags and the rings and then they didn't take the watch or anything. They just left everything there. You see, so it looks like a hit now. They're after me,I can't just meet you," Panayiotou tells Siyoni. The state and defence have spent several weeks arguing the admissibility of the secret recording.Panayiotou's lawyer argued that Siyoni was forced to elicit incriminating evidence from his former boss.The defence claimed that Siyoni was beaten and forced to implicate the businessman, making the video inadmissible.READ: Two new roleplayers emerge in Panayiotou trialPanayiotou faces an additional charge of defeating the ends of justice. eNCA

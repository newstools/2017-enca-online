JOHANNESBURG Ousted Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza told the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein on Friday that his image would suffer irreparable harm if he's not allowed to return to the job while his appeal against his dismissal is under way.His legal team asked the presiding judges to overturn the April ruling that Ntlemeza could not continue as Hawks boss.WATCH: Mbalula visits Hawks offices after Ntlemeza pitched for work It cannot be argued at all that the appellant will not suffer irreparable harm if he is removed from the office, obviously," said Ntlemeza's lawyer, Nceba Dukuda."He is a high-ranking police official, occupying a high-profile office, performing high-profile duties. He is an illustrious policeman in the South African Police Service. There will definitely be irreparable harm. The opposing Helen Suzman Foundation argued that allowing Ntlemeza to return to work would not have any effect on his reputation, as no matter what happened with his appeal, he had already been found to be dishonest and unfit to hold office. Once you have been found to be a dishonourable person who has lied under oath, and has not acted in a bona fide way, how much lower can one go in the public esteem in terms of being fit for a public office? said David Unterhalter SC, who is representing the foundation. Whether you are in the office or not in the office, once you are wholly unsuited to the office it s a most extraordinary argument to say you re entitled to stay in an office where you are disreputable - or rather dishonourable - and thus not permissibly in that office, because that's some aspect of reputation that you are entitled to enjoy. In a twist during a discussion on who would pay for the proceedings, it came to light that the state has been paying Ntlemeza s legal fees, even though he made the application in his personal capacity.Judgment was reserved.eNCA

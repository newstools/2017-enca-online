JOHANNESBURG - The judge heading up the inquiry into struggle icon Ahmed Timol's death, has called for the police officers involved, to testify.The three officers concerned, are apparently still be alive.Magistrate JL de Villiers ruled during an inquest in 1972 that Timol committed suicide by jumping out of the 10th floor of the infamous John Vorster Square, currently known as the Johannesburg Central police station.This new inquest has been fought for by his family for years.The inquiry continues at the South Gauteng High Court, with Professor Kantilal Naik taking the stand.He's described how difficult detention was at the time.Naik: explains that he cried while being tortured at John Vorster Square #TimolInquestNaik: they (police) were not satisfied with the statement I was giving and they said "joy bliksem ons sal jou wys" #TimolInquestNaik says the torture he experienced left his hands immobile, and in need of physiotherapy.Court hears that Naik's "left hand was paralysed and right hand more paralysed" #TimolInquestHe said detainees were never told what happened to Timol.Naik: "I did not know that Timol was tortured and ultimately thrown out of a window nobody told us." #TimolInquestJudge: Prof where you ever charge for any wrong doing? Naik: No, I was just released #TimolInquestNaik told the court that when he was released, police gave him an affidavit to sign saying he wasn't tortured.Naik and Timol were friends and teachers living in Roodepoort at the time of his arrest.Following Naik's release, he had to deal with a lot of people who believed something he said while in detention may have led to Timol's death.Naik says Timol was a good friend of his and the truth is he did not put Timol into difficulty #TimolInquestAhmed Timol's, Mohammed takes to the stand #TimolInquest pic.twitter.com/YVyosUZsy5Naik, ends by thanking the court for listening to his story, clarifying again that he was not a police informer #TimolInquest pic.twitter.com/3Z83mK8DsZeNCA

BRUSSELS - Theresa May said her offer to fellow European Union (EU) leaders to guarantee the rights of their compatriots living in Britain after Brexit, was "very fair and very serious."But, her peers on Friday sounded sceptical, with Belgium's leader calling it "particularly vague."Asked whether he had a clear idea of the kind of Brexit that the UK actually wanted, European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker simply said "No".Given the floor for 10 minutes at the end of a Brussels summit dinner on Thursday, May outlined five principles, notably that no EU citizen resident in Britain at a cut-off date, would be deported.There were roughly three million EU residents living in the UK currently.

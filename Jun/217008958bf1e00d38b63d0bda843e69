LONDON - Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond on Tuesday pressed his case for a smooth Brexit that would avoid a damaging "cliff edge" for businesses, as the country headed out of the European Union.Talks for the UK to leave the EU, the first country to do so in the bloc's history, began in Brussels on Monday. Britain, the EU's biggest financial market, was leaving the bloc in 2019, raising the prospect of an abrupt cut in cross-border links without a new trade deal."We'll almost certainly need an implementation period, outside the (EU's) customs union itself, but with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running," he said in a speech at London's Mansion House on Tuesday.Hammond also said he wanted Britain to lead a "crusade" for the opening up of services markets around the world as it leaves the EU, and said the country wanted to remain open to skilled workers.He spoke about the need for a new system to allow British and EU banks to do business with each other after Brexit, to avoid splitting markets."Fragmentation of financial services would result in poorer quality, higher priced products for everyone concerned," Hammond said.WATCH: Brexit: Why are these negotiations important to South Africans?At present, banks and insurers in London served the EU market from a single base, but this "passporting" was set to end after Brexit, without new arrangements."First, we will need a new process for establishing regulatory requirements for cross-border business between the UK and EU."It must be evidence-based, symmetrical, and transparent. And it must reflect international standards."Second, co-operation arrangements must be reciprocal, reliable, and prioritise financial stability."Crucially they must enable timely and co-ordinated risk management on both sides."Third, these arrangements must be permanent and reliable for the businesses regulated under these regimes," Hammond said.

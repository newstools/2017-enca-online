MOSCOW - Russia on Thursday sent into space a Proton rocket carrying a US telecom satellite, Echostar-21, the first launch in a year after an engine glitch sparked a probe into manufacturing flaws. "The Proton-M was successfully launched at 6.45am" from the Baikonur cosmodrome in southern Kazakhstan, the Russian space agency Roscosmos said."All the phases went off as scheduled," a statement said.The Proton-M is the largest Russian carrier rocket and has been used since 1965. But it grounded Proton launches in June last year after a series of embarrassing setbacks.Echostar-21 will provide telecommunications services in Europe and is set to be put into orbit at 1258 GMT, Roscosmos said.AFP

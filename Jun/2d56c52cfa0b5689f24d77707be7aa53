JOHANNESBURG - Ratings agency Moody's slated the revised Mining Charter on Wednesday, saying it was harmful to the South African economy. The agency says the higher requirement for black economic empowerment equity is credit negative, because mining companies will probably be required to use cash or raise debt to facilitate the equity transfer.Moody's warned that Anglo American, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Petra Diamonds, Sibanye Gold, and South 32 would be negatively affected if the charter was implemented in its current form.WATCH: Mining charter's a mess from start to end, says researcherThe charter raises the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies from 26- to 30 percent, and gives companies 12 months to meet the target.The Chamber of Mines is going to court over the matter.Last week, Moody's downgraded the ratings of both South Africa and its top five banks.eNCA

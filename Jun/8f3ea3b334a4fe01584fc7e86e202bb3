CAPE TOWN - The Cheetahs have denied that there has been any formal invite for them to join the Pro12 League despite increasing suggestions that the move is set to materialise from next year.It emerged last month that the South African Rugby Union has been currently exploring the option for all six Super Rugby franchises to remain involved in competitive action next year, with the Cheetahs and Kings still widely believed to be the teams in line to face the axe from the elite southern hemisphere tournament.At the time, SA Rugby president Mark Alexander said that negotiations were underway with organisers from an overseas competition to possibly accommodate the axed South African sides, while it has since come to light that there have been discussions between stakeholders of the Cheetahs and the Pro12 tournament.The Pro12 is an annual competition involving professional sides from Ireland (four), Italy (two), Scotland (two) and Wales (four), and it would appear that the Cheetahs may well be favourites to earn inclusion should the Free State franchise be dropped from Super Rugby as expected.It s believed that the league has explored various options for expansion as it aims to generate more revenue and tap into new markets, while SARU is also keen to generate new interest and earnings by having a South African side enter into an exciting new venture.Although BBC Scotland reported on Thursday that the Cheetahs had received an invite to join the Pro12, the Cheetahs sought to distance themselves from the suggestion it was a formal offer. For now we are still involved in Super Rugby and any engagements with SA Rugby are sub-judice, so, unfortunately, I cannot offer any comment on the status of those negotiations, Cheetahs CEO Harold Verster confirmed to Jacaranda FM Sport.In April, representatives of the six Super Rugby franchises agreed to a set of criteria to determine the four teams to represent South Africa in the competition from 2018, which were weighted as financial and economic sustainability; a sustainable support base; team performance; and stadium and facilities. These criteria were further broken down in sub-criteria and measurement mechanisms for each of these were also set and agreed upon.SA Rugby stated that they would then collate the applicable data to prepare a recommendation to go back to the franchise committee to make a decision on the final four teams. This proposal will be finally sent to the executive council before it will go to the general council for ratification. The decision was hoped to be finalised by the end of June.Meanwhile, the Australian Rugby Union has also faced considerable opposition to its decision to cut one team from Super Rugby, with both the Melbourne Rebels and Western Force steadfastly opposing the possibility of being cut from the competition.African News Agency

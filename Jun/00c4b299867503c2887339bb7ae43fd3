DA Federal Executive Chair James Selfe was reacting to EFF leader Julius Malema's threat that his party would end its municipal coalitions with the DA in Johannesburg and Tshwane, unless Zille is removed as premier."Well I think it has done damage in two respects firstly because the original tweet and the justification of it gave a lot of offense to millions of people. And then in dealing with the matter we became embroiled in an internal dispute which no voter likes and which we are trying to deal with as best we can, Selfe said.eNCA

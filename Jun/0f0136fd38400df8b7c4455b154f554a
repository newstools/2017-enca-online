* Editor's note: This live event is now over. Watch the recording below. VENTERSDORP - President Jacob Zuma has once again been booed.This time as he delivered his Youth Day message in Ventersdorp, North West, on Friday.A group of students chanted "Zuma must fall" as he took the podium.They were eventually ushered out of the venue by bodyguards, and the president continued.In his address the president said today's youth face struggles of a different kind. 1976 fought for political freedom, which dawned in 1994 after a long protracted struggle by our people. The youth is not fighting for social and economic freedom. The youth of 2017 is fighting for freedom from poverty, inequality and unemployment. The government in 1976 responded with guns to the call of young people of freedom and a better life. The democratic government calls for young people to work with us in all spheres of government as we proceed to ensure that young people live in decent homes, in communities with roads, electricity and recreational facilities, said Zuma. It's not the first time the president's been booed.A May Day rally in Bloemfontein was cancelled after supporters prevented Zuma from speaking.Cosatu, which hosted that rally, has since banned President Zuma from addressing its events.eNCA

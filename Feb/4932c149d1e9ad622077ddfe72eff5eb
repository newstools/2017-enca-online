MUNICH - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday she would like to discuss cyber attacks and fake news with Russia, but it was questionable whether the problem of fake news could be successfully addressed before European elections this year."We know that Russia communicates very openly that it views hybrid warfare as a form of defence," Merkel told the Munich Security Conference when asked about the issue of fake news."If I could wish for one thing, it would certainly be very good to get this topic, for example, on the agenda in the framework of NATO-Russia talks."Reuters

We did a lot of background planning and this camp will give us the opportunity to take the objectives we agreed on at the various indabas, to the training field, said Coetzee. This group was selected before the start of Vodacom Super Rugby so that we could adhere to World Rugby regulations by giving notice of the camp 14 days in advance. READ: Allister Coetzee best man for the job, says HoskinsSA Rugby CEO, Jurie Roux, said: I want to thank our franchisees for their cooperation and releasing their players during Vodacom Super Rugby for the three Springbok camps. Unfortunately, we did not have any of these camps in 2016 and we know it is very important for the players and the coaches to spend as much time together as possible before the start of the season.

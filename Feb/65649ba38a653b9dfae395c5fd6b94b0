CAPE TOWN The Department of Social Development and the South African Social Security Agency face tough questions on Wednesday morning as they brief Parliament on the state of readiness for the payment of grants from April.In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that the tender awarded to Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) by Sassa was unlawful. The unanimous judgment by the highest court in the land declared the contract invalid and ordered that the tender process be rerun.It said CPS had to continue to carry out its obligation to pay welfare grants, and that Sassa must come up with a final solution.READ: Sassa fails to file papers on grant crisisSassa s contract with CPS expires at the end of March.

OKAYAMA, Japan - With only a skimpy loincloth to protect their modesty, thousands of men brave freezing temperatures to fight for lucky charms thrown by a priest at Japan's annual Naked Man Festival.A writhing mass of sweaty worshippers wrestled for elbow-room inside Saidaiji Temple in Okayama, western Japan, late on Saturday night in the hope of catching the sacred batons.Around 10,000 hardy souls celebrating the religious festival stepped under ice-cold fountains to purify their bodies before risking life and limb in a mysterious ceremony dating back some 500 years.

"I had to quickly slip it into my loincloth to hide it and then force my way out." 5 Things You Need To know About Japan s Naked Man Festival. https://t.co/c7rFEpz4Na Photo:natgeo pic.twitter.com/824mlWILgr High priest Zenko Tsuboi insisted the festival was not an orgy of violence, even if wailing ambulance sirens have provided an unwanted soundtrack in previous years."Those who catch the charms will prosper and receive a bumper harvest," he said."We want to remind people this is a religious festival so we have become much stricter these days about alcohol and rough behaviour."As revellers and the hundreds of police and firemen on call made their way back through the rice fields to the city, father-to-be Yasuhara broke into a wide grin."This charm is a gift from the gods," he said. "I believe it will deliver us a bouncing baby when it's born in April."AFP

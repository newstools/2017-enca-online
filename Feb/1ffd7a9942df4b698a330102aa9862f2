AMONA, Palestinian Territories - Israeli police began evicting dozens of hardline Jewish settlers from a wildcat outpost on Wednesday, just hours after unveiling plans for 3,000 new homes in other West Bank settlements.The announcement of new settler homes was the fourth since US President Donald Trump took office less than two weeks ago having signalled a softer stance on Israeli settlement building.It was seen as a sop to supporters of the Amona outpost where hundreds of police officers moved in to carry out the evictions after the High Court determined the homes were built on private Palestinian land.The operation marked the end of months of attempts by government hardliners to legalise the outpost near Ramallah.

We're ready to respond if necessary to any violence," he said.Officers were however "attacked by anarchists with materials that made their eyes burn," police said of the youth activists, noting that 13 officers were "lightly wounded by stones and the liquids thrown at them."Police arrested four protesters and distanced dozens of others from Amona, with seven of the families so far evacuating peacefully with their children.Youths confronted the forces with chants such as "How will you feel tomorrow after you evacuate a Jew from his home?" and "Today it's me, tomorrow it will be you," as police began evacuating them from the area.

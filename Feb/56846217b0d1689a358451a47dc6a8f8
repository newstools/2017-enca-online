JOHANNESBURG The Competition Commission first got a whiff of currency collusion after it was approached by one of the 17 banks accused of manipulating the exchange rate.The commission said the bank offered to spill the beans in return for immunity from prosecution.Three South African banks are allegedly involved in the collusion. The Competition Commission was approached by one of the banks, which applied for corporate leniency. In terms of the corporate leniency policies of the commission if a firm is involved in a cartel it can approach the commission and disclose the information about the cartel in return for immunity from prosecution. So we were approached by one of the banks, said the commission's cartels division manager, Makgale Mohlala.Zuma: Government must act against banks on price-fixingThe Competition Tribunal will make the the final decision on what happens to the three South African banks among those of manipulating the price of the rand.The commission claims that the banks manipulated the rand/dollar exchange rate to increase their profits. They allegedly distorted demand and supply of the currency.Deputy commissioner Hardin Ratshisusu said."We have incontrovertible evidence that shows how these traders and banks were involved in this conduct, how this affected the economy. At this point we can draw inferences in the sense that any collusive arrangement is mean to draw undue profit by parties involved. Political parties have called for the banks to be punished.eNCA

KINSHASA - Crop-destroying caterpillars known as armyworms have ravaged 63,000 hectares of maize in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo since December, causing local maize prices to triple, a UN spokeswoman said on Wednesday.Suspected outbreaks have already erupted in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, South Africa, Namibia and Mozambique, and scientists say the armyworm could reach tropical Asia and the Mediterranean in the next few years.The armyworm has already ravaged crops across several southern African countries with Zimbabwe being the hardest hit.READ: Armyworm confirmed in SAThe worm threatens South Africa's food security as maize is the most consumed crop. It's extremely difficult to stop this from coming in because with globalisation of trade we bring in goods, and with tourism, we bring in goods and stuff from all over the world so it's almost inevitable that things are brought in. What is so difficult is to find it in any consignment, said agronomist Janny Vos of the Agriculture and Biosciences Centre. They often come in as an egg mass or as a pupa and they are very, very small and difficult to be noticed. So what is important is to know how it looks like when it comes out and how the damage looks so that you can react very, very early, and we think that window has been missed on this occasion, said Vos.

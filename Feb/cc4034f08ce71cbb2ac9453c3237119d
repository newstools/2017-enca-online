We know that if the so-called discouraged job seekers are included then the unemployment rate is at 37.4 percent, Masemola said.He said between 5,000 and 8,000 workers in the beverage industry faced the chop should government implement the sugar tax plan. The sugar tax is a drinks tax on sugary beverages aimed at reducing consumption of drinks containing added sugar.Masemola said Treasury was pressing forward with implementing the sugar tax in April this year, despite its own research showing that it would result in job losses.The poultry sector was also bleeding jobs as chicken imports from the US flooded the local market. While economic policies and political factors are responsible for the downturn and job losses in other developed and developing countries, our problems are self-inflicted, emanating mostly from poor, short-sighted decisions by our government and with little, if any, consultation. Masemola said his union was shocked at how the government was handling the job crisis.The extended meeting, taking place in Johannesburg next week, would see invited experts and analysts discuss ways through which job losses could be mitigated.The union is a former affiliate of the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu).African News Agency

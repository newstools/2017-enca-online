JOHANNESBURG The Labour Court has dismissed former Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba s application to block the South African Football Association (Safa) from appointing a successor.Mashaba was fired as national team coach in December last year after a disciplinary committee found him guilty of contravening Safa's communications policy as well as gross misconduct and insubordination.Mashaba was suspended after a television camera caught him ranting at critics, while reports claimed he also insulted Safa head Danny Jordaan after a 2-1 win against Senegal in November last year.At a hearing, Mashaba was released with immediate effect.Dennis Mumble, Safa's chief executive, said at the time: It is regrettable that we had to face the events of the past month at a time when the national team is experiencing a resurgence in its quest to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

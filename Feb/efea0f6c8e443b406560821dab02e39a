JOHANNESBURG National Treasury has once again shot down claims that the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill (Fica) will be used by banks to unfairly target black business.National Treasury deputy Director General, Ishmail Momoniat, said there s no evidence to support this allegation.This comes after Parliament s finance portfolio committee resumed hearings into the constitutionality of the legislation on Wednesday. This first concern was that the Fica will be felt mainly by black businesses, the way it was expressed was supported by anecdotal evidence and wasn t supported by actual hard evidence. That doesn t mean that it wouldn t happen and that s why I think it s in the implementation that we need to look at what s being done, said Momoniat.Committee chair Yunus Carrim disagreed.READ: Fica bill could embarrass ANC donors: ManyiCarrim said that currently - directly or indirectly - a bank s policies can be discriminatory. Because of our racialised history racialised economy and the way Africans are seen in daily life 23 years later the effect would discriminatory, I m not saying all the banks are bad the stuff is racist and so on. It s much more subtle. The Banking Association of South Africa said it was probing the matter. Obviously race is still an issue in our country and certainly even in normal business practises in banks anymore either inadvertently or advertently there s a racial overlay and we can t run away from that but these are things we working to get information we will get you details to your committee on transformation and so on the 14th of March, said Banking Association of South Africa managing director, Cas Coovadia.Public hearings continue next week.eNCA

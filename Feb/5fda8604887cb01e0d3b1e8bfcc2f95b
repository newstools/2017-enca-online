JOHANNESBURG - Nigeria and Angola are expected to be the main borrowers among sub-Saharan African countries in 2017 even though many sovereigns intend to slash their debt, according to an S&P Global Ratings report.Grouped together, SA, Angola and Nigeria, the region s largest economies, are set to issue most of the government commercial debt, at $35bn, or about 82% of the total borrowing for the subcontinent.S&P, the world s largest credit ratings agency, rates 17 sub-Saharan African countries. These 17 states are expected to borrow about $43bn from longterm lenders in 2017 nearly two-fifths less than in 2016. A large depreciation in currencies and faltering economies [had] ... forced borrowers to take a breather, the agency said.In 2017, 47% of gross borrowing will be used to refinance maturing long-term debt. This was 38% in 2016. We expect a total estimated net new borrowing, excluding refinancing requirement, of 23bn in 2017, S&P said.In the budget review published last week, the Treasury proposed gross borrowing requirements of R220.9bn for the 2017-18 financial year.The government relies on three sources of borrowing: short-term Treasury bills; fixedrate, inflation-linked and retail savings bonds; and foreign-currency borrowing.SA s debt is predominantly rand-denominated but most of it is held by foreigners.Exchange rates play an important role in decisions about buying rand debt for foreign investors, but this limits risk for the government when the rand experiences fluctuations.Government debt now stands at R2.2-trillion, or 50.7% of GDP.The R220.9bn pencilled in for borrowing in 2017-18 is equivalent to 3.1% of GDP.S&P rates SA s debt on the lowest rung at BBB- with a negative outlook, one notch above junk status.Botswana is the only subSaharan African sovereign in the A-rated category a coveted slot occupied by 1% of states.The share of BBB category debt is expected to rise to about 49%, all of which was South African debt, the agency said. Despite a projected decrease in borrowing, SA will remain the biggest borrower in sub-Saharan Africa, the credit ratings agency said.iNet Bridge

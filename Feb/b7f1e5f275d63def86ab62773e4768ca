ST. MORITZ - American Mikaela Shiffrin remained on course for a third consecutive world slalom title after dominating the first leg in St Moritz on Saturday.The 21-year-old, who won giant slalom silver on Thursday, was first out of the start gate and clocked a leading 47.80sec down the Suvretta course in brilliant sunshine.Switzerland's Wendy Holdener, who won gold in the last week's alpine combined event, was in second, at 0.38sec.Slovak pair Veronika Velez Zuzulova (+0.59) and Petra Vlhova (+0.76) were next, ahead of Sweden's Frida Hansdotter, Switzerland's Michelle Gisin and Austrian Michaela Kirchgasser.The second leg, scheduled for 1200 GMT, will be set by Shiffrin's personal coach, Mike Day, chosen in a random draw of all coaches, but potentially offering an edge to the American ahead of what would be a famous victory.The last female skier to bag three consecutive slalom crowns was Germany's Christel Cranz, but that was back in 1937-39 when the world championships were much smaller, equipment used was nowhere near as cutting edge as it is today, and course-setting and preparation were not nearly as taxing as modern skiers face.Should Shiffrin win, she would become the seventh skier to have managed to win an individual event at three consecutive world championships after Cranz (twice), France's Marielle Goitschel, Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark, Switzerland's Erika Hess, Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt and fellow American Ted Ligety.Shiffrin, who also won Olympic slalom gold in the Sochi Games, currently also tops the race for the overall World Cup crystal globe, with closest rival Lara Gut now ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury sustained in St Moritz.AFP

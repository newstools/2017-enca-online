BOGOTA - An explosion near a bullring in Bogota Sunday killed a policeman and injured about 30 other people, city officials said.Mayor Enrique Penalosa said on Twitter that the police officer was killed by an "explosive" while his office said separately that 31 people were injured, two of them seriously, in the incident.It occurred near the Plaza Santamaria bullring, which was beset by protesters on January 22, when bullfights resumed there after a four-year hiatus.The injured were mainly police protecting the venue, as they have every bullfight Sunday since the protests, local media reported.Penalosa, who overflew the scene in a helicopter, said the area had been secured."Anyone who wants to go to the bullfight can do so in safety," he tweeted."The terrorists are not going to intimidate us and we are going to do what is necessary to capture them," he added.The authorities have not said who was behind the explosion or whether anti-bullfight activists were suspected.Closed in 2012 by the city's former leftist mayor Gustavo Petro, the bullring was ordered to reopen by Colombia's Constitutional Court.AFP

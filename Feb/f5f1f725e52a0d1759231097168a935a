PACIFIC PALISADES, United States - Dustin Johnson birdied three of his last four holes in a five-under par 66 on Saturday to take a one-stroke lead after the second round at the weather-hit Genesis Open.The US Open champion, who could jump from number three in the world to number one with a long sought victory at Riviera Country Club, had a 36-hole total of 10-under par 132.He was one shot in front of US compatriots Pat Perez, who closed with back-to-back birdies for a 66, and Cameron Tringale, who had seven birdies in an impressive seven-under 64.It was a further two strokes back to Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas and Americans Patrick Rodgers and JT Poston on 135.Johnson, whose six top-10 finishes at Riviera include a playoff loss two years ago, could supplant Jason Day atop the world rankings if he can break through for a first win at the classic course west of Los Angeles."I want to put myself in position to win this golf tournament, that's really all I care about is what it takes to get it done here," Johnson said. "The rest of the stuff, the points and world golf rankings, yeah, I would like to get there, but I'm not worried about it."Whether a win would catapult him to the top depends on just where Day finishes. The Australian was eight off the pace after completing his rain-disrupted second round early Saturday.Day was among the players forced off the course when wind and heavy rain swept through on Friday -- when Johnson never made it to the first tee.Day said the disruptions were less of a problem than his own "scratchy" game."I didn't hit it good," he said. "When you're thinking too much technique you're losing focus of actually the target -- I'm getting in my own way, really."But I've still got two more rounds and I feel confident that I can get some good stuff going," he added.Although the third round began shortly after the second ended, with only a couple of hours of daylight remaining, Sunday was shaping up as a marathon.A confident Johnson was undaunted by the prospect."Thirty-six holes can be a really good thing sometimes if you're playing really well, which I feel like the golf game, I'm in control of it right now," he said. "So playing 36 in one day is not going to be a problem." Johnson had five birdies, rolling in putts of more than 30 feet at the fourth and 15th, and draining a 20-footer at the 18th."I definitely rolled the putter good," he said. "I'm feeling really comfortable over it. I'm seeing the lines really well and I feel like I've got a pretty good touch on the greens right now."I hit a lot of really good shots today," he added. "The few times that I got out of position I was able to save pars, hit some good pitches, got up and down from the bunker on 10 -- all in all it was a pretty solid day."Eighteen players were within five strokes of Johnson's lead. That included two-time major winner Jordan Spieth, who headlined a group on five-under 137.Those missing the cut at even par included Japan's world number five Hideki Matsuyama, who imploded in the adverse conditions on Friday and couldn't get back on track as he closed out a nine-over par second round on Saturday.First-round leader Sam Saunders, grandson of golf great Arnold Palmer, ballooned to a 77 but just made the cut.AFP

JOHANNESBURG Bidvest Wits booked a date in the 2017 CAF Champions League first round with Egyptian giants and eight-time competition winners Al Ahly after beating Saint-Louisienne 3-1 at the Bidvest Stadium on Saturday evening.The second leg win, sealed by a dramatic late goal by Cuthbert Malajila, gave Wits a 4-3 aggregate victory after last weekend s 2-1 defeat away in Reunion.A moment s silence was observed ahead of kick off after the visiting team s president died just hours earlier on Saturday morning.Having lost the first leg tie 1-2, Clever Boys coach Gavin Hunt reverted to a near full-strength XI and Wits started the game very much on the front foot, unlucky not to register on the scoresheet after 10 minutes when Siboniso Gaxa s header struck the woodwork.The pressure continued to mount from the home side as Thulani Hlatshwayo got on the end of a 21st-minute corner kick but steered his shot just past the outside of the post.And Wits grabbed the lead in the 27th minute when Daine Klate s perfectly flighted free kick flew in.The goal brought the aggregate scoreline to 2-2, with the Students through on the away goal rule.Klate, Gabadinho Mhango and Ben Motshwari all had chances before the break to give the home team more breathing space, but the score remained 1-0 at half time.That changed just a minute after the restart thanks to a brilliant solo goal from Sifiso Myeni, who got the better of two defenders before firing past Saint-Louisienne keeper Frederic Seng.The home team did not let up after their second and continued to threaten the Saint-Louisienne defence, but it wouldn t fall for the likes of Myeni, Xola Mlambo and Cuthbert Malajila in front of goal.The failure to add a buffer goal proved costly when the visiting team scored through Philean 15 minutes from time.With the tie all square at 3-3 (2-1 in Johannesburg and 1-2 away from home last week), penalties were looming large.But Malajila had other ideas as he controlled the ball in the box in the 86th minute before turning and firing home a volley to keep the Clever Boys Champions League dreams alive.Three-time domestic league-winning coach Hunt will now be licking his licks at the prospect of taking on an Al Ahly outfit that are with little doubt Africa s greatest club side.African News Agency

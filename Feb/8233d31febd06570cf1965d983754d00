Farmers should work hand in hand with the department for technical advice on chemicals before using any, he said.One of the farmers, Christopher Sefara, said he started planting in December and three weeks later he saw a lot of birds and butterflies around the farm.

We had not yet experienced great damage because in my opinion the department is making an effort to assist us and we are very grateful for their support. Confirmation of FAW presence brings automatic activation of the contingency plan developed by the department. In line with this plan funds have been set aside for buying pesticides to assist affected farmers.North West premier Supra Mahumapelo said it had been agreed with the national department to use the agricultural support grant to help farmers affected by the worm.

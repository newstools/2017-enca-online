The doctors and nurses who work at the neonatal ICU unit at Groote Schuur Hospital are inspiring and I thank them. We learn about love from them and I live for love. WATCH: Wayde van Niekerk back home from RioOdessa Swarts, Van Niekerk s mother said: Wayde weighed about a kilogram when he was born at 29 weeks and was just flesh and bone needing a blood transfusion and treatment. Growing up he was always healthy and only went to the doctor once. We found this out when re-applying to put him on our medical aid when he turned 18. Prem babies can turn out the strongest. They start fighting the first second they come into the world for their lives. My son is such a fighter and never gives up. AFP

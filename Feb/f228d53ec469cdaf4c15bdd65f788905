INDIA Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal claimed six wickets to demolish England and hand India a 75-run series-clinching win in the third and final Twenty20 international in Bangalore on Wednesday.Chahal recorded his T20 best of 6-25 to help skittle out England for 127 in 16.3 overs. The visitors, chasing 203, lost eight wickets for eight runs in the space of 18 deliveries.The 23-year-old Chahal became only the second bowler in T20 cricket to get six wickets in an innings after Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews achieved the feat twice with figures of 6-8 and 6-16.The attacking spinner started England's batting rot in the 14th over of the innings, getting dangermen Joe Root (42) and skipper Eoin Morgan (40) on consecutive deliveries to derail the tourists' chase. And it is a wrap!

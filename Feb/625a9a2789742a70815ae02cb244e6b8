CAPE TOWN - A visual artist in Cape Town has come under fire for trying to get white South Africans to introspect.The violent response to the work, has however been a motivator for the artist to continue promoting anti-racism.Dean Hutton s controversial work, criticised by right wing groups has now been defaced.Hutton s work is meant to start a meaningful conversation, to get white people to introspect on their complicity in upholding a racist system.Hutton says, "My intention is not to make a whole bunch of people angry. My intention is to wake up people that are almost there, to move them to a point of action. A lot of people have contacted me, that are ready to start fighting and working against white supremacy." White people are not yet prepared to consider how they are complicit in either racism or systemic inequality."The work was inspired by a Fees Must Fall student, who wore a t-shirt with the same slogan during protests.Watch the full story in the gallery above. eNCA

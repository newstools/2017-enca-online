JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura insists that the provincial executive council would have never approved the transfer of mentally-ill patients from Life Esidimeni to NGOs.Speaking at the state of the province address on Monday, Makhura said the executive council was not consulted on the matter and even if it was informed, it would have rejected this move.Makhura: Decision to move Life Esidimeni patients not made in consultation with the provincial council, I would not have approved it #GPSOPAPremier Makhura claims he didn't know #Esidimeni psychiatric patients were going to NGOs, but I repeatedly warned this would be a disaster! The executive council and I would have never approved a plan to outsource mental health, a primary responsibility of the state to take care of particularly the most vulnerable in our society. We would never have supported a decision to outsource this to NGOs whether they were licensed or not. What makes this worse is the fact that such NGOs don't meet the standards required, said Makhura.More than 100 mental health patients lost their lives after they moved from Life Esidimeni and placed in inadequate facilities.

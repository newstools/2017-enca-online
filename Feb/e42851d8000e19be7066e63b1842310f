JOHANNESBURG - A solid 85 in 80 balls from AB de Villiers, combined with Quinton de Kock's 68 off 70 balls, helped South Africa to post a competitive 271-8 on a slow and difficult Wellington pitch.With all the Proteas bowlers firing, New Zealand were dismissed for 112 at the Westpac Stadium, giving South Africa a resounding 159 run victory.The Black Caps were never in the match, losing both openers cheaply before a 37-run partnership between Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor gave them a modicum of hope.However, the introduction of Andile Phelukwayo and Dwaine Pretorius to the bowling attack saw the already tentative run rate further constricted, and wickets fell rapidly as New Zealand attempted to break the siege.Williamson and Taylor fell within three runs of each other, followed soon after by Broom and Santner, and at 58-6 with an ever-increasing run rate, the Caps were effectively out of the picture.James Neesham fell to Parnell in his second spell, leaving New Zealand on 77-7 and Rabada soon matched Parnell, having Southee caught by De Kock for his second wicket with half New Zealand's overs completed. GOT HIM! Parnell gets his 2nd, Neesham is caught & bowled for 13. NZ 77/7 (23.5 ovs), need 195 to win. #ProteaFire #NZvSA pic.twitter.com/orY42pv9Ke Imran Tahir, hammered for 11 in his first over, and for once the Proteas least successful bowler, was reintroduced and prceeded to take a maiden wicket, clean bowling Lockie Ferguson for four.Colin de Grandhomme offered the only resistance to South Africa's inevitable march to victory, his 34 not out off 34 balls ensuring they were not skittled out for under 100 runs.Dwayne Pretorius, in dismissing Trent Boult for 4, delivered the remarkable figures of 3 for 5 in 5.2 overs, a rare occasion where a strike bowler goes for under a run an over.ICYMI: @ABdeVilliers17 became the fastest player to reach 9000 ODI runs (205 innings). #ProteaFire #NZvSA pic.twitter.com/9FU6LNBcXHREAD: New Zealand beat Proteas to level seriesDe Villiers became the fastest batsman to reach 9,000 runs during the Proteas innings, surpassing the record previously held by Sourav Ganguly.South Africa take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. eNCA

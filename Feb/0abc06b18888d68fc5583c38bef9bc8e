KIGALI - The lack of access to telecommunication services among Rwandans in the rural areas is soon set to be a thing of the past with the launch of a project providing remote populations with the same level of connectivity enjoyed by citizens in developed markets.Vanu Rwanda, a subsidiary of a United States-based company in cellular networks, to date has ten sites on air and by the end of this year, there will be a total of 376 sites, covering approximately one million people in previously unserved areas of rural Rwanda.The project should make Rwanda the most connected country in Africa.Vanu has licensed spectrum from the Rwanda Utilities and Regulatory Organisation to provide mobile network operators with solar-enabled services aimed at hard-to-reach consumers.Airtel Rwanda is the first operator to use this service. Vanu intends to take the project further than Rwanda.African News Agency

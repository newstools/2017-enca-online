GUAYAQUIL - Before Ecuador heads to the polls Sunday (February 19), domestic and international officials are preparing to monitor the vote.An ally of Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa and a conservative ex-banker are battling to become the next president in Sunday's election in the face of corruption scandals and a lackluster economy.Polls show 63-year-old former Vice President Lenin Moreno ahead, but the ruling party candidate, who has used a wheelchair since being shot during a 1998 robbery, appears to be just short of the minimum needed to win outright in the first round.That would trigger an April 2 runoff, probably against opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, a 61-year-old former executive president of Banco de Guayaquil.Disparate opposition factions in the oil-producing country of 17 million people, which stretches from the Andes to the Galapagos Islands, may then unite to support Lasso, giving him an edge over Moreno, analysts said.Officials are looking to ensure the voting goes off without a hitch."We are going to have certain reports come in during the election, and later after the closing, when the tallying will take place, we are going to have the first results. This information will be gathered statistically and we are going to have different checks for possible differences among the results. This is the first review we will have and we are going to be able to compare and contrast those results. As I said, the second phase will be the physical ballots, and we will be able to demonstrate among the votes that our delegates including electoral authorities will have obtained if there've been changes or alterations," said Juan Carlos Intriago, the director of the CREO electoral control movement.The CREO movement counts some 40,000 members who work to protect the vote at ballot sites."We will give a copy of these reviewed ballots to political organisations and we will be able to make public a copy for the media outlets and the public that will be scanned from the same site. And so on the same night we hope to have scanned all the votes of all the 41,000 ballot collection sites from the 3,500 precincts. This gives us two goals to accomplish. The first is speed with delivering the results, and the second is total transparency because political organisations will be able to present their delegates from each vote collection site as well for the site where the scan is made for effective control," said Juan Pablo Pozo, the president of the Ecuadorean Electoral Counsel (CNE).The UNASUR regional bloc has sent in an observer mission, which includes former Uruguayan President, Jose Mujica.Lasso has promised to slash taxes, foster foreign investment and remove Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from the country's embassy in London, where he is avoiding extradition to Sweden over rape allegations.READ: Security breached at Ecuadorian embassy in LondonA Lasso victory would intensify the return of the right in South America, where Argentina, Brazil and Peru have all shifted away from leftist rule in the past 18 months as a decade-long commodities boom ended.A Lasso administration would also seek quick renegotiation of opaque financing deals with China as well as lead regional opposition to crisis-hit Venezuela's Socialist government, his running mate Andres Paez said in an interview.Moreno, who wants to boost social welfare and has a more conciliatory style than the fiery Correa, has struggled to gain a decisive lead. Polls show he is unlikely to win more than 40 percent of valid votes and pocket a 10-point difference with his closest rival as required to avoid a runoff.Leading pollster Cedatos said this month that 32.3 percent of Ecuadoreans planned to vote for Moreno versus 21.5 percent for Lasso.A corruption case at Ecuador's national oil company as well as the Latin America-wide scandal involving Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht have weighed on Moreno, whose running mate is Jorge Glas, the country's vice president and former strategic sectors minister.Polls show a significant number of Ecuador's 12.8 million voters are undecided.The next presidential term starts on May 24 and lasts four years. Correa plans to move to Belgium with his Belgian wife after leaving office.Reuters

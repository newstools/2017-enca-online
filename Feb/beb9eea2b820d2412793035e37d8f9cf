It has originated from America, where they use certain pesticides depending on the ecological situation, he said. Southern Africa is different. The control mechanism might be completely different. So we have agreed also to do a lot of research and very urgently at national and regional level to find ways of controlling it. Zambia has reported that farmers have had to replant almost 90,000 hectares of maize crops as a result of the caterpillar.In Malawi, some 17,000 hectares have so far been affected.The damage is worse in Namibia, with approximately 50,000 hectares of maize and millet damaged.But Zimbabwe has seen the worst of it, with approximately 130,000 hectares affected so far.

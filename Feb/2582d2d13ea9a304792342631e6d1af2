[WATCH] #Gigaba: "Those who instigated this, to put our country in panic mode, we wonder if they are happy now." #Xenophobia #DStv 403 pic.twitter.com/nrn2H49Sfk "We have been hurt by the fear we saw in the eyes and voices of many fellow Africans who feared for their lives; wondering if they and their children, their loved ones and property will be the end of the uncertain imminent turmoil, be safe." Clashes erupted in Pretoria on Friday, following an anti-illegal immigrant march.

Gigaba says deep-rooted socio-economic problems in the country have compounded frustrations against foreign nationals.
	
	“We’ve not made enough progress to address poverty, unemployment and inequality. But I want you to know, that our region of Southern Africa in our continent of Africa is not a barrier but a path to our salvation from poverty, unemployment and inequality."

"Just as we do not talk black crime, or Sesotho crime, Zulu crime etc; let us not talk about immigrant crime." "Just as a car hijacker who is Zulu does not mean all Zulus do crime, so a drug dealer who happens to be Nigerian does not mean all Nigerians do crime.” Gigaba: The vast majority of South Africans are not xenophobic, the majority of immigrants are law abiding citizens #Xenophobia Standing ovation for Gigaba after a very heartfelt, impassioned plea for peace, and harmony between SAns and immigrants #Xenophobia pic.twitter.com/J2SAtdOFfq eNCA

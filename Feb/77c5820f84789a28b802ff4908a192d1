JOHANNESBURG - New Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret started his tenure with a 1-1 Premiership draw against Polokwane City at a wet Orlando Stadium on Saturday afternoon.It was the Limpopo side s fourth 1-1 scoreline of 2017, while the Buccaneers are now without a win in nine league encounters.Pirates failed to show much purpose in the first half and rarely put the visiting side under pressure.It was Rise and Shine who enjoyed more shots on goal during the first half, although Brighton Mhlongo did not have to make any saves as Rodney Ramagalela fired wide after some good combination play in the 14th minute, before Edgar Manaka also failed to hit the target on 30 minutes with another effort from range.Bucs best, and only real opportunity of the opening stanza came in the 34th minute when Mpho Makola cut in from the left flank and curled a shot towards the far corner, only for George Chigova to make a finger-tip save.WATCH: Pirates committed to ensure violent behaviour isn't repeated Ramagalela sounded a warning just after the break when he fired over the bar after another promising move by Polokwane. It was the former Sundowns striker who broke the deadlock, showing great composure to beat Mhlongo from a narrow angle in the 53rd minute after being played in by Sipho Jembula.Manyisa rides a tackle from Tlou Segolela, who makes a return to Orlando in the Polokwane City colours #OnceAlways pic.twitter.com/QjbajiB2liBut Pirates response was swift, the game back on level terms just four minutes later when some poor defending allowed Dove Wome to bring down a cross and slot in from 12-yards out.Wome had a great chance shortly after when he was picked out by Makola, but from a good position in the box the Togo attacker ballooned his shot into the stands.Wome was doing his best to win the game for Pirates and forced Chigova into making a superb diving save to keep his 74th minute shot out the top corner.The game remained open and Jabu Maluleke s stinging free kick was tipped over the bar by Mhlongo with eight minutes to play.Bucs were unlucky not to sneak a 90th minute winner when Riyaad Norodien s snap shot hit the upright, but on the balance of play, a point each was probably a fair reflection of a game which came to life in the second half.

There's a few players who impressed me, some that must be spoken to"Jonevret must now turn his attention to next weekend s Soweto derby against Kaizer ChiefsAfrican News Agency

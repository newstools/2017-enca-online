Olivier was the only bowler to take over 50 wickets during the franchise four-day season competition, the Sunfoil Series.The inclusion of wicketkeeper Klaasen, 25, comes on the back of impressive form for his franchise, the Multiply Titans, in the Sunfoil Series.The right-hander was seventh on the run-scoring charts with 635 runs at an average of 48.84, including a season-best 195.READ: New Zealand beat Proteas to level series Heinrich Klaasen was one of the top performers throughout the season and he is rewarded for his form by being included in the Test squad, commented CSA selection convener Linda Zondi. With Dane Vilas no longer available for selection, it was an opportunity to reward someone else. This will be an excellent opportunity for Heinrich and we wish him all the best. Meanwhile, De Bruyn, 24, also keeps his place after he was also chosen in the squad against Sri Lanka. He was the third highest scorer with 751 runs in the Sunfoil Series and also the captain of the competition winning VKB Knights.Olivier, Morkel and Morris join Kagiso Rabada, Vernon Philander and Wayne Parnell in the squad, giving South Africa plenty of options in the fast bowling department.READ: Proteas beat New Zealand in first ODI Morne Morkel has worked hard on his fitness over the past few months and we believe he is now 100 per cent fit and fully able to compete for his place in the team, Zondi added. We have six quality fast bowlers in the squad and that shows just how much of depth the country has in this department. Keshav Maharaj is the only spinner in the squad.The players who are currently not involved in the ODI series will depart for New Zealand on Saturday, to prepare and acclimatise ahead of the first Test starting in Dunedin on March 8.Standard Bank Proteas Test squad: Faf du Plessis (Capt) (Multiply Titans) Stephen Cook (bizhub Highveld Lions) Dean Elgar (Multiply Titans) Hashim Amla (BuildNat Cape Cobras) JP Duminy (BuildNat Cape Cobras) Temba Bavuma (bizhub Highveld Lions) Quinton de Kock (Multiply Titans) Vernon Philander (BuildNat Cape Cobras) Keshav Maharaj (HollywoodBets Dolphins) Wayne Parnell (BuildNat Cape Cobras) Kagiso Rabada (bizhub Highveld Lions) Duanne Olivier (VKB Knights) Theunis de Bruyn (VKB Knights) Heinrich Klaasen (Multiply Titans) Morne Morkel (Multiply Titans) Chris Morris (Multiply Titans).

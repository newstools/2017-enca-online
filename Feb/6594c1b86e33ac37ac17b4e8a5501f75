DURBAN - Centuries by Faf du Plessis and David Miller saw South Africa to 307 for 6 in the second One Day International, a total which proved far too formidable for a fragile Sri Lankan batting lineup.Du Plessis set up the Proteas for victory with a patient 105 off 164 balls before Miller tightened the screws with a fluent 117 off 138 balls.Sri Lanka's batting lineup was under pressure as soon as the first wicket partnership was broken with the score on 45, and wickets fell regularly thereafter, with Dinesh Chandimal top scoring for the visitors with 36.Sri Lanka were finally dismissed after 37.5 overs for a score of 186, 122 runs short of their target.An unusual statistic played out in the game, with no bowler taking more than two wickets in either innings. eNCA

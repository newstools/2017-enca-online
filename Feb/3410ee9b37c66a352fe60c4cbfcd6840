JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba won t back down on calls for illegal foreign nationals to face the full might of the law.After another night of violent confrontations on Sunday, Mashaba said he was interested only in providing a safe city.Analysts argue that his rhetoric could be part of the problem.Jeppestown is the latest area where violence between South Africans and foreign nationals has flared up. READ: Mashaba's task team raids Rosettenville housesForeign shopkeepers stayed closed on Monday as they repaired stores that were looted overnight.It's unclear how the latest standoff started but there's a general acceptance that criminality is playing a part in the unfolding violence; for this reason Mashaba remains unrepentant for his remarks. I will repeat: This country can t be a jungle. This country requires it to have the rule of law. Our communities out there are crying for help and for anybody to blame me for that is unfortunate and I don t think anybody can blame me for asking for the rule of law, the mayor said.Any community engagement he had engaged in, from Rosettenville to the inner city. had always been with a view to rooting out criminality, not victimising foreign nationals, he said..Commentators argue that Mashaba s speech has been problematic, but he's not solely to blame.Selby Xinwa of the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation stated: Key drivers of violence are unemployment, poverty, and inequality. Part of that {is also] ... that as a country we have institutionalised violence in terms of how we solve our problems. We ve normalised it. We say: For us to be able to solve things we must use violence.'"Mashaba said he would continue engaging with the government on the issue of xenophobia and use all available police to promote law and order for locals and expatriates alike. eNCA

JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has been urged to institute an investigation by tax ombudsman Judge Bernard Ngoepe into allegations that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) is deliberately delaying the payment of VAT refunds in order to boost its revenue-collection outcome.DA deputy spokesperson on finance Alf Lees has appealed to Gordhan to request Ngoepe to investigate following reports that there is a backlog in the region of R5bn in the payment of VAT refunds which Lees said was a clear indication of the weak administration and technology at SARS .The SARS VAT system also handles diesel refunds which have a backlog amounting to an estimated R1bn. The delay of the diesel refunds has a devastating impact on business mining and agriculture in particular. We understand that the processing of diesel refunds has ... ground to a halt Lees said on Monday.But SARS group executive for employee relations Luther Lebelo denied that there were backlogs and said SARS had paid out R10bn more in VAT refunds this year compared to the previous fiscal year. He said there was a backlog of R4bn in VAT refunds in December because of the deluge of last-minute claims which had clogged the system but that this had been cleared in January.Lees stressed that SARS had to ensure the efficiency and credibility of the VAT system. There has been a failure by the commissioner and senior management to ensure that technology systems and skills are updated and developed. Lees said SARS systems did not have the capacity to deal with refunds within the required time limits. Requests had been made to the SARS digital technology management committee to authorise system upgrades but this had not been done. The [committee s] tendency to delay its consideration of proposals has resulted in the backlog of VAT and diesel refunds growing bigger he said.The delays with VAT and diesel refunds had a negative effect on small businesses which rely on timeous refunds to keep their cash flow positive.Lees requested Gordhan to institute a probe three weeks ago and said he would again write to him to find out whether this was done and if not to urge him to do so without delay.iNet Bridge

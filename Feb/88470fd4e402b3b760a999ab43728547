NEW ORLEANS - In the full-court layup drill and three-point contest otherwise known as the 66th NBA All-Star Game, New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis set an All-Star record with 52 points and Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook added 41 points to carry the Western Conference to a 192-182 victory over the Eastern Conference on Sunday night in New Orleans.

Antetokounmpo stole the ball near midcourt and had a four-on-one against Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry.Curry found a spot in the middle of the lane - 10 feet in front of the basket - and laid stomach-first on the floor while Antetokounmpo hit an uncontested layup.The world did not stop spinning on its axis, but it did skip a beat midway through the first quarter when the West embarked on an otherwise mundane offensive possession.Westbrook and Durant ran across midcourt on either side of the key.Westbrook flicked a pass to Durant on the left side, and Durant threw it right back to Westbrook on a give-and-go that resulted in an easy layup and a 31-28 West lead.At the next timeout, the West bench greeted Durant and Westbrook with high-fives, and someone poured a bottle of water on Durant's head.Clippers center DeAndre Jordan came over and bear-hugged Westbrook as team managers got on the floor and wiped up the water.READ: Harden, LeBron, Westbrook shine in NBAThe East led 53-48 after 12 minutes - the 101 combined points was an All-Star Game record for a quarter - and the West took a 97-92 halftime lead.The 189 first-half points broke the All-Star record of 187 points set in the first half last year (West 104, East 83).There was no defence allowed, so 58.1 percent shooting by the West and 58.0 percent by the East in the first half actually was a shade disappointing.

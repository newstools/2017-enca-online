"Just as we do not talk black crime, or Sesotho crime, Zulu crime etc; let us not talk about immigrant crime.""Just as a car hijacker who is Zulu does not mean all Zulus do crime, so a drug dealer who happens to be Nigerian does not mean all Nigerians do crime. Gigaba: The vast majority of South Africans are not xenophobic, the majority of immigrants are law abiding citizens #Xenophobia Standing ovation for Gigaba after a very heartfelt, impassioned plea for peace, and harmony between SAns and immigrants #Xenophobia pic.twitter.com/J2SAtdOFfq eNCA

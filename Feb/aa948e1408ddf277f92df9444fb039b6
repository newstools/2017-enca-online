FULL FEATURE PAGE: Rite of passage denied BLOEMFONTEIN - Itumeleng Khotseng says he was with his brother when he died. He attempted to remove him from the initiation school a number of times when he realised something was wrong but each time he was refused. His mother, Cythia also made such an attempt. Itumeleng states that one day he attempted to help Tshepo with some chores at the school when the initiates turned on him and beat him, saying he needs to stop spoiling his brother. The next day when he went back, his brother Tshepo was tied up, and was having trouble swallowing. Tshepo was later beaten for not being able to finish his chores. In that time, he fell and hit his head on a rock. When Itumeleng contronted the initiation school owner and said Tshepo was near death, his eyes rolling into the back of his head, the owner conceded and took them to the hospital, but left him and his brother there. The doctor told him that his brother’s death was not a result of natural causes but foul play. Itumeleng says, “He died in my arms as we were taking him to hospital."

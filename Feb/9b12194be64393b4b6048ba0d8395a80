BERLIN - Bayern Munich coach Carlo Ancelotti could be in hot water with the German FA (DFB) after admitting showing the middle finger towards Hertha Berlin fans who he claims spat at him."Yes, I made the gesture after being spat at," the Italian told broadcaster ARD.Hertha fans were enraged after Bayern equalised with a Robert Lewandowski goal in the 96th minute at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday.That allowed them to snatch a 1-1 draw which left the Bavarians five points clear of RB Leipzig at the top of the Bundesliga.The middle finger gesture happened as Ancelotti walked towards the players' tunnel in Berlin.On Sunday, the DFB confirmed to SID, an AFP subsidiary, that they will be investigating what happened in Berlin.Ancelotti is likely to be fined after the DFB ruled FC Union Berlin's then-coach Norbert Duewel had to pay 3,500 euros ($3,715) for a similar gesture in December 2014.Hans-Joachim Watzke, CEO of Bayern's rivals Borussia Dortmund, has some sympathy for Ancelotti's angry gesture."I wouldn't want to see him taken to task for this. It's unpleasant when snot lands on you from above," the Dortmund boss told broadcaster ZDF.Nevertheless, tempers frayed on the pitch in Berlin as Lewandowski equalised seconds before the referee blew the final whistle and Hertha's coach Pal Dardai branded the six minutes of added time 'Bayern's bonus'."We always fight until the end. It wasn't my best goal and was my last ball contact of the game -- you can't get later than that," admitted Lewandowski, who scored after 95 minutes and 59 seconds.His goal came later than the five minutes of added time the fourth official had previously indicated. Hertha's goalscorer Vedad Ibisevic, who gave the hosts a first-half lead, was not amused."Why did there have to be five minutes of added time and then two minutes extra? Where did that come from? That only happens to Bayern!," he fumed.AFP

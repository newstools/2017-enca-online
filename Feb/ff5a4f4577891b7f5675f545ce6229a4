JOHANNESBURG - Acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane agreed on Tuesday that the ongoing feud between himself and Robert McBride, head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), reflects badly on the police and the country.Speaking at a briefing of Parliament s Portfolio Committee on Police he said: I must agree that it is not good for the organisation, it is not good for the country."It cannot go on forever but I hope that at some point we do not subscribe to a trial through the media. We do not subscribe to people serving their own purposes. People throwing allegations without doing what they are supposed to be doing, which is investigation to allow an outcome. EFF's Mhlongo says IPID's Robert McBride and SAPS Gen. Phahlane must be locked in a room to air their grievances. #PoliceMcBride last week told the committee that Phahlane had lied when he had said he had not been told he was being investigated by Ipid.Phahlane is being investigated for possible corruption in the building of his R8-million home in an exclusive estate outside Pretoria. Ipid wants to know how he was able to afford the property.Phahlane re McBride: He's not paying attention to a "trial by media" and not listening to people "causing sensation and hullabaloo".It is also alleged Phahlane asked a witness not to cooperate with the investigation.READ NEXT: Phahlane behind arrests, says O'SullivaneNCA

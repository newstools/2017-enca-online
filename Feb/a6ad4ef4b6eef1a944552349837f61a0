VATICAN The famous frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, whose ceiling was painted by Michelangelo, can now be examined in minute detail thanks to an unprecedented photographic venture, the Vatican Museums have said.By combining innovative digital technology and special LED lamps which aimed to reproduce daylight, photographers were able to make images measuring 43cm tall by 1,2m wide.The work includes 220 life-sized images from the chapel, including elements of The Last Judgement as well as frescoes painted on the walls by Perugino and Botticelli.

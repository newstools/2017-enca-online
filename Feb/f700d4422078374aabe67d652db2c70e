PRETORIA - The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) says it s in a position to better fund more students than ever before.This year, R15-billion has been allocated to more than 400,000 students.READ: NSFAS applications openThat's R2-billion more than last year.Officials say more money means students will be funded for registration, tuition, accommodation and food.More and more students are wanting the state to fund their tertiary education.READ: NSFAS extends application period for fundingThe cost of educating one of them through NSFAS, ranges from R40,000 to R150,000 per annum.The scheme says it s up for the task. So far it's received just under 310,000 applications."Out of these applications received NSFAS has so far approved and sent communication to a total of 105,135 new successful students and confirmed funding for a 204,653 returning students, said NSFAS Chairperson, Sizwe Nxasana.An additional 100,000 students will be accommodated, once they've been evaluated.This year NSFAS did things differently. It introduced a student-centred model where students apply directly to it rather than through one of the institutions.Officials say although there ve been some teething problems, 15-percent of funds were released before the start of the academic year.READ: NSFAS pays R1.3bn upfront for needy students This year we are covering more students and provide the average cost of studying for those students and therefore we have eliminated the so called 'top slicing' where you had a practice by some universities who were spreading money around for more students and giving them a little bit," Nxasana said."So certainly students are better funded which takes care of registration fees, tuition fees and even their allowances for books and accommodation."NSFAS has also noted the unrest at some universities over accommodation. NSFAS does not make decisions on which students qualify for private accommodation allowances. Additionally NSFAS does not have any relationship with private accommodation providers and we are not involved in any accreditation process, Nxasana said.This year has seen the largest number of applications being declined: more than 53,000. But it s not all bad news, the financial aid scheme says unsuccessful students can still lodge an appeal before the end of the month.READ: Students face blacklisting over loanseNCA

LONDON - Antonio Conte would happily expose himself to the curse of the Premier League title winners if it means Chelsea are crowned English champions this season.Claudio Ranieri was sacked by Leicester on Thursday less than nine months after masterminding his club's incredible title triumph.READ: Chelsea star Hazard doesn't have a price: ConteThe Italian isn't the only recent English title winning boss to be axed not long after his moment of glory however.Jose Mourinho was sacked Chelsea in December 2015, seven months after winning the Premier League, while Manuel Pellegrini lasted only two more years after winning the title with Manchester City in 2014.Roberto Mancini, tipped to replace Ranieri at Leicester, won the title with Manchester City in 2012 and yet exactly a year later he was dismissed.With Chelsea eight points clear at the top ahead of Saturday's home clash with Swansea, Blues boss Conte, who took charge in July, knows there is a reasonable chance he will be the next manager to lift the trophy and he doesn't care about any supposed curse.Winning team!

It won't be easy, but I'm ready to take this risk (if it) means we won the league."Conte laughed off the prospect of being sacked, as he did earlier in this season before Chelsea won 13 successive Premier League games to take pole position in the title race."If you remember very well I was already sacked this season with the bookmakers," Conte added."I was lucky to keep the right concentration and to continue the work."

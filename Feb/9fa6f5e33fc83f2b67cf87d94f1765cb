PARLIAMENT – President Jacob Zuma has replied to the State of the Nation (Sona) on Thursday following a debate by MPs over the past couple of days. Zuma condemned the behaviour of MPs during his address, saying they have a responsibility to conduct themselves in a manner that gives hope to South Africans. "The conduct we saw in this house traumatised millions of South Africans as well as (praise singer) 12-year-old Given Lubisi who came here to impress members of Parliament and the nation with his artistic skills," Zuma said. Zuma reiterated his call for radical economic transformation, responding to critics who said transformation was an empty promise. He also touched on issues of land and race in the country. Opposition parties debating the contents of last Thursday's address attacked and scrutinised Zuma's character. The Economic Freedom Fighters and Cope boycotted the debate, but Cope MPs made a return on Wednesday calling for Parliament to be dissolved.

TRIPOLI - Libyans marked the anniversary on Friday of the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Muammar Gaddafi, waving flags in central Tripoli even as the country reels from political chaos and security problems.Thousands of people gathered in the capital's Martyrs' Square flying the national flag as fireworks lit the night sky and passing motorists sounded their horns in support.Forces loyal to the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) were deployed as a security measure to ensure the commemoration was trouble-free.The country has been wracked by chaos since Gaddafi was toppled, with rival militias and administrations vying for control. A rival authority based in the east has refused to recognise the GNA since it began work in Tripoli in March last year.#Libya: thousands of Libyans gathered on Martyrs Square in #Tripoli to celebrate the 6the anniversary of the Libyan revolution pic.twitter.com/Jugzfzs9UDRida al-Mahmudi, 62, said he allowed his teenage sons to join Friday's celebrations, even if his heart was not really in it."I sent my two boys to Martyrs' Square where many people are gathered to participate in this big happy event. They're teenagers -- they wouldn't understand if I told them the country is in chaos," he said."All they know is that six years ago we got rid of 42 years of brutal dictatorship, and that youngsters a little bit older than them died in the process of liberating their homeland. Let them be happy."Tomorrow I'll worry about whether I can get cash from the bank or not. But today, it's time for joy," he added.READ: Libya unity govt slams creation of rival 'national guard'In addition to political rivalries, the rise of jihadism and the presence of powerful militias, Libyans say living conditions have deteriorated since March last year. These include power cuts, exorbitant prices and security issues that plague their daily lives, which are often interrupted by clashes between rival groups.But for Fatima al-Arbi, 59, 17 February is a day to be celebrated because it marked the beginning of the end for Gaddafi, who was killed on 20 October 2011. "We have to celebrate in spite of all that is happening in Libya today," she said."Let's not mix things, what politicians and external agendas have done is another thing. I don't want my grandchildren to miss out on such a happy occasion, and I don't want them to forget the meaning of this date."We have the right to be proud of 17 February 17 and we have the right to be happy about it. No one has the right to take this away from us," she said.Libyans have also been marking the sixth anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising in second city Benghazi, the cradle of the revolution, and other cities since Thursday.AFP

PORT ELIZABETH - Five Wells Estate residents will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Friday after being arrested on Thursday for public violence while protesting against their eviction from municipal land. They erected their dwellings last month after failing to be allocated homes in the latest RDP housing project. They say renting a house is unaffordable as most of them are unemployed."Most people here they are renting houses and we can't afford the rental. Secondly most of us have been on the waiting list since 1999 and we still haven't received a house," said resident Nceba Ntlanganiso.READ: Ekurhuleni condemns EFF's land invasion callsThe Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMB) accuses the residents of trying to jump the housing queue.NMB Mayoral Committee Member, Ngaba Bhanga, said, "There's a plus minus 80,000 housing backlog but it's unfortunate that there are people who want to skip the queue. What worries me the most is that there a people within the people occupying the land who are not genuinely occupying the land for housing purposes (but) who are selling the sites."Hundreds of structures were cleared after the NMB obtained a court order to have the land invaders removed.Sheriff of the Court, Llewellyn Sharp said, The order actually stated that the respondents - that's the community who has actually invaded the area - has 48 hours to voluntarily vacate the land and to remove the illegal structures, and because they didn't comply with the initial order the Sheriff was authorised by the court to remove them."The residents are now scrambling to find a place to stay before nightfall.eNCA

JOHANNESBURG Jamie Riddle and Hayley Preen were the big winners at South Africa s premier off-road triathlon, the Fedhealth Xterra Lite in Grabouw, outside Cape Town, on Sunday.Making his Xterra Grabouw debut on the day, Jamie Riddle was pulling no punches completing the 400m swim, 15km MTB and 6.5km trail run in a combined time of 1 hour 9 minutes and 34 seconds. I loved every second of the race, said Riddle. Coming from a road triathlon background I didn t know what to expect. Xterra is definitely more dirty and fun. I loved it. Samuel Courts came in second, while German Xterra Warrior, Philipp Sassie finished third.Reigning Xterra Lite Grabouw Champion, Hayley Preen was back with a vengeance. I had my best swim ever today, says Preen. I was in third place going into transition. I managed to catch the second lady almost straight away on the mountain bike course and could see the first lady on the climb. I caught her and then went as hard as I could on the single track. From there I was pretty much on my own and proceeded to have a great run. I love the Xterra Lite and I love the Xterra off-road vibe. Preen claimed victory in an impressive time of 1:19:01. Shanae Williams came in second, while Bridget Theunissen finished third.African News Agency

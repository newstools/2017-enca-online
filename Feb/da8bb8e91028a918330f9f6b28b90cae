JOHANNESBURG - Thabo Mbeki, in his new capacity as chancellor of Unisa, on Monday condemned the recent anti-immigrant protest march, which was preceded by attacks on foreign nationals in different parts of Gauteng. As South Africans, we should never forget the enormous sacrifices that were made by the sister people of Africa, to help us achieve our liberation. We cannot now behave in a manner that treats fellow Africans, who are now residents in our country, as enemies or unwelcome guests. Neither should we commit the offence of viewing or characterising African migrants in our country as criminals, Mbeki said at a media briefing after his inauguration.He said higher education institutions across the country and the continent had an important role to play in transformation. He spoke against xenophobia levelled at students from elsewhere in Africa, and against African immigrants in general.The former South African president was speaking at a media briefing following his inauguration in Pretoria.WATCH: Mbeki inaugurated as Unisa chancellor"What South Africa needs, what the continent needs, is these trained people, properly prepared, properly educated and all of that, but properly oriented in the context exactly of what this university says about itself. That it is an African university," he said. eNCA

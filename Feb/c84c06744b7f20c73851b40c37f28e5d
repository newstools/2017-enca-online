True to form, the Economic Freedom Fighters were unable to resist taking a dig at the president. EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi rose pre-emptively to question why President Jacob Zuma should be thanked as Gordhan was busy wrapping his speech with gratitudes. "There is no guidance that Zuma gives, that Mr Zuma gives to this country," Comrade Bae said, as speaker Baleka Mbete tried to quell the disturbance. "He must not be thanked in the name of this parliament; in the name of the people of South Africa."  But that's not all ... Minister Gordhan got a standing ovation from THE ENTIRE parly except Dlamini, Mahlobo, Van Rooyen, Lindiwe Zulu. You can't make this up! @SakinaKamwendo So Pravin #Gordhan got a standing ovation from all MPs except the captured Van Rooyen, Lindiwe Zulu, Dlamini, Mahlobo, etc pic.twitter.com/0TtSVkYvnd Parliament gave a standing ovation for Pravin Gordhan, but one #Gupta controlled group was not impressed. #Budget2017 #Budgetspeech pic.twitter.com/oFBEo1HgCS All in a day's work. eNCA

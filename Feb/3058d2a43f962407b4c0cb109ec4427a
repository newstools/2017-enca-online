PARLIAMENT - Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete says there is nothing untoward about the security measures put in place for this year's State of the Nation Address (Sona). Mbete said South Africa is not a banana republic and any country that takes itself seriously would implement the same measures. The Speaker is also of the view that South Africans have "had enough of the drama" that has characterised the first session of the National Assembly over recent years. "I think the drama happens and probably now, South Africans have seen enough of it and hopefully we are moving on, we're maturing and we are no longer wasting our energies on dramas," Mbete said speaking to eNCA from the parliamentary precinct on Thursday morning, where security had already been tightened.

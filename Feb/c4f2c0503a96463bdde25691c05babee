BANGUI, Central African Republic - One rebel was killed and seven others wounded when UN attack helicopters carried out strikes in the Central African Republic against fighters advancing on the city of Bambari, the UN spokesperson said Monday.Three rebels were detained by UN peacekeepers during the operation on Sunday and will be questioned by local authorities, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.The UN military intervention was to "prevent a war in Bambari" between two rival groups, the Popular Front for the Renaissance of the Central African Republic Republic (FPRC) and the Union for Peace in Central Africa (UPC), said Dujarric.It was the second time in as many weeks the UN has fired on gunmen moving toward the central city.The two factions have been fighting for control of taxes levied on Fulani herders during the current seasonal migration.The United Nations has deployed 12,000 peacekeepers to the Central African Republic to help restore stability following a war in 2013 that erupted after the overthrow of leader Francois Bozize, a Christian, by Muslim rebels from the Seleka coalition.AFP

PARLIAMENT ANC MP Makhosi Khoza on Tuesday confirmed she is being moved out of her position on Parliament s Standing Committee on Finance, but says she does not know why, despite speculation that her departure was intended to make way for former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe. If you want to know about my appointment and being moved, the first person to speak to is Jackson Mthembu because he is the one that is responsible, at least in this institution, for the deployment of ANC members, Khoza said on the sidelines of Parliament s ad hoc committee probing the affairs of the SABC board. Khoza is a member of the ad hoc committee.WATCH: Dr Khoza is grilled in Puppet vs ProtectorKhoza said a letter informing her of her new role in the portfolio committee on public service and administration was dated February 8, but she only received it last week.

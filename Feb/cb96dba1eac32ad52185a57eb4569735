She has undergone intense rehabilitation training and with pure ambition and determination, she has worked her way back into competing in sports at international championship level. I used to tie a track chair to my wheelchair so I could go train at the UJ stadium. pic.twitter.com/mzp9jFztC1 Manaleng competes in wheelchair track racing and hand-cycling.She said that 2017 road race was an interesting route. I enjoyed it. I think if I could do it again I d do it again If we start at 5am maybe. I think I almost melted on the road, she laughed.Meanwhile, London Paralympian Pieter Supapiet du Preez once again swept up his second National gold medal for the championship in the H1 category. It went well. I m glad they changed the start time to a little bit earlier so we had incredible but still hot weather, he said.Du Preez mentioned that the course was a tough one, but fun and enjoyable, and that he had a good time out there. I was also happy with how good my form is because I have been training really hard, and I really peaked entirely for this, he added.Du Preez mentioned that the 2016 and 2017 events were worlds apart. This year is much hotter, but also, the time trial actually dropped 100m in altitude from start to finish last year. So even though there were a few hills, it was a very fast Time Trial.The Women s T1 Road Race Championship gold medal was claimed by Toni Mould, who once again stole the hearts of those around her with her constant cheers of enthusiasm for her fellow cyclists.Goldy Fuchs (pictured above) did the double as he grabbed the Men s T2 Road Race gold medal after winning the Time Trial in his category on Tuesday.Juan Odendaal looked smashing on the Men s C3 Podium in his National Jersey after winning the Road Race in his category, and Phillo Verlaat claimed the first podium spot in the Men s C2 event.Gysie van der Niet smashed his Men s H4 Road Race in a time one hour, 27 minutes and 40.029 seconds. Finishing behind Van der Niet was Patrick Rasedimo in second place, and the bronze medal went to Barend Coetzee. -- Additional reporting eNCAResultsRoad races: Men s H1 1.

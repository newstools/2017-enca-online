PRETORIA The SA Under-20 men s team (Amajita) arrived in Ndola, Zambia late on Friday only to be met with logistical issues. They had to change their tournament base due to lack of accommodation space at their initial hotel, and were moved to Kitwe 25km outside of Ndola. Amajita are in Zambia for the CAF under-20 Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off on Sunday with the first round of Group A matches in Lusaka. Group B will be in action on Monday, when Senegal takes to the field against Sudan, and later South Africa will lock horns with Cameroon in the second match of the day. The top four in the tournament will qualify for the 2017 edition of the Under-20 World Cup to be hosted by South Korea in May. We had a few issues with our accommodation on arrival, and while we were a little disappointed we would like to thank CAF, the Local Organising Committee, and of course, our team manager Levy Ramajoe for their efficient help in resolving the issue speedily, said Amajita head coach Thabo Senong. The players are now settled and already in tournament mode. The focus is now solely on Cameroon and we are grateful we can continue with our preparations. African News Agency

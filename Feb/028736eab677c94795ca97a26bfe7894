MILAN - Veteran designer Karl Lagerfeld celebrated exquisite backsides with the help of supermodel Gigi Hadid on Thursday as he unveiled his sumptuous Fendi autumn-winter 2017 collection.The female derriere took centre stage thanks to thonged leotards under sheer dresses.Beyond that, camel coats, soft A-line skirts and dresses were inspired by Viennese woodblock printing and 18-century Italian "papiers dominotes", a precursor to modern wallpaper -- think geometric patterns. Finale at Fendi F/W17- red boots are a staple piece for Fall. #MFW pic.twitter.com/d7jgAbol65 The brand's famous fur coats were embellished with overlaid mosaics, while cobalt, petrol blue or white shirts and dresses were made in printed silk.Shirts were tucked in at the front but not at the back, a look the Rome-based fashion house is reclaiming from the streets. Skirts were layered, with a cream underlay peeking out below the top coat.

It has been generating significant revenue growth for its French parent, luxury group LVMH, which posted record results in 2016.Waists for this winter have been nipped in, while seams were pulled together with a softly sparkling 'X' motif. The models wore gold hoop earrings.For those red carpet events, there were two long-sleeved gowns in ruched tulle embroidered with large organza flowers.There was also a new addition to the eye-wateringly expensive range of accessories that drive Fendi's revenues: a new double handle box bag in two-tone leather with inlaid python skin.But it will be shoe fetishists that will have the most fun with Fendi's patent red thigh-high boots with elastic ribbing.At least those braving their bottoms this winter for Fendi will have warm knees.AFP

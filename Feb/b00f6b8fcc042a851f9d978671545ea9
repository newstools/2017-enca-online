I don't know but in my opinion he is one of the players who can make Everton more stronger."It's all about what the player likes, what Manchester United needs to do, and we are not involved in that project."But every player that we at Everton think can make the team stronger is welcome to Everton."'Class apart'Steve Walsh, Everton's director of football, endorsed Koeman's comments, adding: "Wayne Rooney is one of the greatest players that has ever played the game in England and for us not to be interested would be wrong.WATCH: Wayne Roney's 250th goal"He started his career here and if the opportunity arose that he could come back and it sat well with everyone it is something we would consider."He is a class apart, he sees things, and all the things that have been said about Wayne are true. He comes into that category of being one of England's greatest ever players, so why wouldn't we be interested?"But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

That was heightened when he was left on the bench for Sunday's League Cup final win against Southampton at Wembley. AFP

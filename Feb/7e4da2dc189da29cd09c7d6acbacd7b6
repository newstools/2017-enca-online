She said she just wanted what was best for her daughter. I did not dispute to Mbuso s request for paternity tests, however, my only grievances while we are going through with this process what is going to happen to the child. What is the child going to eat over this four weeks, she said. My daughter s school fees are in arrears and there are some other things that needs to be paid for.

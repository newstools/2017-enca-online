JOHANNESBURG - Eskom will continue interrupting power supply to the eMalahleni and Msukaligwa municipalities in Mpumalanga at the weekend as communicated in a final-decision notice distributed through different media last week.On Saturday and Sunday power supply to the municipalities will be interrupted from 8.30am to 11am and 3pm to 5.30pm. The schedule will go back to 6am to 8am and 5pm to 7.30pm from Mondays to Fridays.READ: Leeway for defaulting municipalitiesEskom group executive for customer services Ayanda Noah said: "The interruption of supply as a result of non-payment remains an agonising decision for Eskom and is a means of last resort. We hope the municipalities will come up with a sustainable payment plan and thus avert further interruptions for its citizens."In spite of the fact that both the provisions of the Electricity Regulation Act 4 of 2006 and supply agreements (with the municipalities) empower Eskom to disconnect electricity completely, Eskom has opted for a softer approach of interrupting electricity during certain hours in the day.To avoid supply interruptions, defaulting municipalities need to meet the following three requirements:Should the municipalities meet these requirements their supply interruptions will be suspended.Municipal customers are encouraged to engage with their supply authorities to get updated information on their municipalities arrears.eNCA

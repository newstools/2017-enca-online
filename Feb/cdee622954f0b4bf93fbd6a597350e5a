LOS ANGELES Even the Razzie Awards are getting political. A documentary criticising US Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton tied on Saturday with superhero ensemble Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice on a list of the year's worst achievements in film, winning four Razzies apiece. The annual tongue-in-cheek Razzie awards, which serve as an antidote to Hollywood's Oscars ceremony, named Dinesh D'Souza's Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party as the worst film of 2016.D'Souza, a conservative commentator and best-selling author, was named worst actor for narrating his documentary and worst director alongside Bruce Schooley.Worst actress went to the person who portrayed Clinton in the film.Hillary's America took in a modest $13-million (R167,65m) at the North American box office last year.The Razzies, or Golden Raspberry awards, follow a Hollywood awards season marked by outspoken speeches and protests against the policies and behaviour of US President Donald Trump.The season culminates with Sunday's Oscars ceremony.Batman v Superman also won four Razzies, including worst screen combo for "Ben Affleck & His BFF (Baddest Foe Forever) Henry Cavill" and worst "remake, rip-off or sequel".The annual Razzie Redeemer Award went to veteran actor-director Mel Gibson. Gibson has been welcomed back into the folds of Hollywood with his war drama Hacksaw Ridge a decade after a drunken anti-Semitic rant made him an outcast.Hacksaw Ridge is nominated for six Oscars on Sunday, including Gibson for director.Winners of the year's worst films are given a gold, spray-painted trophy.Winners of the Razzies are voted for online by around 1,000 Razzie members from 24 countries, who sign up online and pay a $40 membership fee.

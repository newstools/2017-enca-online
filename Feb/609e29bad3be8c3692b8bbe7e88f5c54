READ: Post Office and suspended CEO part ways Its capital adequacy would have to be addressed. Postbank had depositor funds of R4.9bn in 5.7-million customer accounts at the end of December and investments of R7.3bn. Barnes said Postbank was profitable, well capitalised and the corporatisation process is on track . Postbank staff, operations and its balance sheet would transfer from the Postbank division to the new entity after the incorporation process.Establishing the bank is one aspect of a multipronged strategy to modernise Sapo and put it on a profitable and sustainable footing in the face of the growth in digital communication.Barnes wants Postbank to be the agency chosen by the Social Security Agency of SA to pay social grants. Sapo was uniquely positioned to assume this task because it had 2,400 points of presence throughout the country, he argues.Sapo, Barnes noted, was expected to make a net loss of R1.1bn, more or less in line with net loss of R1.2bn set in its corporate plan.Total revenue of R3.6bn was earned in the period to December as against the corporate plan s target of R6.8bn for the full year.iNet Bridge

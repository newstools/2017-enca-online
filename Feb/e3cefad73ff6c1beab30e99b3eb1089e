JOHANNESBURG - Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, in his Budget Speech, offered some relief to prospective first-time homeowners by removing transfer fees on properties sold for R900,000 or less.The property market has welcomed the move, which takes effect on Wednesday saying the tax break will encourage home ownership.Jawitz Properties CEO, Herschel Jawitz, said, "What it means for a potential buyer is if you're buying at R900,000, you're saving R4,500 on transfer duty. And at that level of the market it's a lot of money that can be used towards your other transaction costs; moving costs or a deposit....given the general state of the economy, it was a very generous concession."But, economists are less enthusiastic about the broader impact of this move on the housing market.ABSA property economist Jacques du Toit said, "Against the broader economic environment and financial pressure on consumers we believe the property market will remain relatively subdued this year."For first time homeowners, there are usually a number of questions to consider, like what can you afford and what are the hidden transactional and legal costs involved?Nevertheless, experts say now is probably the ideal time for first time-buyers to get into the market.eNCA

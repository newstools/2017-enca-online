FOR AM JOHANNESBURG - A number of organisations have raised concerns over the potential effect of the fuel tax increase on ordinary businesses and consumers.From 1 April motorists will pay an extra 39 cents for fuel after Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced increases to the fuel and Road Accident Fund levies in the Budget.The Automobile Association of South Africa (AA) is calling for a review of the fuel levies and how they're collected, adding that the hike will hit motorists hard.READ: Petrol Price in SA: What are you really paying for?AA spokesperson, Layton Beard said, It's the second year that we're seeing an increase in fuel levy. we saw an increase last year of 35 cents and we're seeing another 30 cents increase in the general fuel levy this year. there's also an increase in road accident fund levy. Both of these are gonna give us a combined total of about R4.78 that gets added to the fuel price so that motorists pay."Experts say global petrol prices have been on the rise.Xhanti Payi an economist, said, "People tend to look at past prices of petrol and say 'well why price of petrol is going down even though the price of oil is falling?' It's because the taxes themselves actually don't come down, they keep increasing. We should actually start at some point start asking why ourselves why it's so relevant - what makes the administration of this particular tax is so important for everyone?" The Automobile Association of South Africa wants both levies reviewed.Beard explained, "We have long called for a portion of this fuel levy to be ring-fenced and used for projects such as Gauteng s e-tolls but the money collected through this levy does not go towards this."Treasury is currently mulling the potential of removing the current zero VAT rating on fuel. eNCA

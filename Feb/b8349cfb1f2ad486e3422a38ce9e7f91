In a tribute during the Armed Forces Day parade in Durban on Tuesday, President Jacob Zuma described the more than 600 volunteers who lost their lives on the vessel as peace-loving internationalists, "Black people had volunteered to join the world war in order to fight fascism. They were ahead of their time. They were internationalists who loved peace and justice."They also joined the war believing that their contribution would lead to better treatment back at home after the war by the colonial masters. Unfortunately their sacrifice did not earn them any respect by the rulers of the time, Zuma said.eNCA

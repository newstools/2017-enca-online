 Tweets about @OfficialCSA #NZvSA CHRISTCHURCH - A record-breaking century from Ross Taylor steered New Zealand to an imposing 289 for four in the second one-day international against South Africa on Wednesday.Taylor completed his ton in dramatic fashion with a boundary off the last ball of the innings to finish 102 not out and claim a New Zealand record of 17 ODI centuries.The 32-year-old, who had shared the record of 16 with Nathan Astle, received solid support from captain Kane Williamson and all-rounder Jimmy Neesham.Neesham scored an unbeaten 71, while Williamson notched 69 -- a return to form for a batting line-up which has been over-reliant on tail-end contributions recently.However, there were also concerns for New Zealand, with opener Tom Latham and Neil Broom only scoring two runs apiece.Latham, in particular, will face intense pressure to keep his place after ducks in his previous two ODIs.

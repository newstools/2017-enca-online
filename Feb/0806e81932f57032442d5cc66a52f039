WINDHOEK Namibian President Hage Geingob says his administration is bloated because of the inherited civil servants structure of the apartheid era that is being maintained in the interest of reconciliation. Addressing his staff at their annual meeting with the Office of the President on Monday, Geingob said it was nothing new for the president to have advisers. The way people are talking about advisers it is like a new thing, but I am not the one who introduced it. Presidential advisers have always been part of our structure. Geingob emphasised that during the apartheid era, black Namibians were excluded from high positions of responsibility and that after independence government could have fired all white people but did not, to consider everyone as One Namibia-One Nation. What we need to do now is to improve our performance and output. This year, let us defeat the naysayers with success and let us defeat them with hard work.

If we are to downsize now we will end up sending many people into the streets and add to the already high number of unemployed people. African News Agency

LONDON - A hat-trick of tries by rugby league convert Denny Solomona inspired Sale to an impressive 34-28 victory over Premiership leaders Wasps on Sunday.Solomona -- whose move to Sale last December from rugby league outfit Castleford has provoked legal action from his former club -- scored all three of his haul in the first-half on what proved a frustrating return to Sale for their former playmaker Danny Cipriani.Wasps still top the table, a bonus point after they launched a second-half comeback -- led by Australian star Kurtley Beale who also scored a try -- having trailed 31-9 at one point seeing them extend their lead to six points over champions Saracens, beaten by Gloucester on Friday.Exeter, who beat struggling Worcester 48-32 on Saturday, are also six points adrift.Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said Sale prevailed not because his players took Sale for granted but because their opponents were sharper."I'm sure there will be accusations of complacency, but I don't think that was the case," said the 49-year-old former Wales and British and Irish Lions prop."It is very hard to argue that we weren't where we should be at mentally. We made uncharacteristic mistakes first half that we haven't done all season."I thought they were the better team, had more edge to them than we did and I thought they deserved their win."Solomona's raw talent was applauded by Sale's director of rugby Steve Diamond as he took his tally to seven tries in his first five five matches -- a new Premiership record."Denny takes his opportunities and makes his opportunities and that is what we knew he'd bring to the party," said Diamond."If he keeps doing that, he'll go a long way." There was also a hat-trick of tries in Sunday's other match with Newcastle Falcons' Tongan scrum-half Sone Takulua going over three times and adding nine points with the boot in their 46-31 victory over Northampton.A thrilling spectacle saw 11 tries scored in all and the hosts turned the game on its head scoring four tries in 18 minutes in the second-half. A late try by hooker Richie Hibbard secured Gloucester a deserved 31-23 victory over Saracens who went down to a second successive defeat for the first time since May 2015.Former Welsh international Hibbard's try added to those of man of the match Tom Marshall and his Kiwi compatriot Jeremy Thrush as European champions Saracens conceded three tries for the first time this season and failed to secure a bonus point of any sort for the first time in 11 months.For watching England coach Eddie Jones there was positive news in that Saracens prop Mako Vunipola returned to action for the first time in almost four months after a knee injury."It was a very different defeat to last week's performance (they lost to second from bottom Worcester) and I don't think that you can fault the effort," said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall.AFP

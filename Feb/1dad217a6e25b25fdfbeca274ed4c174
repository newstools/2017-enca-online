CAPE TOWN - There appears to be division in the ANC over support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Year after year, there has been speculation as to whether he will hold onto his job as custodian of the country s purse.This year is no different, as rumours of a cabinet reshuffle does the rounds amid speculation that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is being deployed to Parliament to replace Gordhan who still enjoys the confidence of South Africans and the market. READ: What to expect from Pravin GordhanGordhan is unpopular with many inside the ANC as some have accused him of being too close to white-owned business and of also being an obstacle to the ANC s plan for Radical Economic Transformation.Political Analyst Sanusha Naidu believes that Gordhan s challenge is to convince those who are calling for his head that he is not anti-transformation. The challenge is for Pravin Gordhan to prove that he's not anti-transformation and that's a very difficult thing to do because he's dealing with a model of the economy that is imbedded in a neo-liberal framework, said Sanusha. And so often the challenge for ministers in the economic clusters is to say we're pro transformation, but the model may be the one that's at fault here. READ: Cabinet fully behind Gordhan, says HanekomAnother analyst suggests removing Gordhan would see a backlash from the public and markets but in the end, it is at the sole decision of one man, President Jacob Zuma. The minister enjoys a measure of confidence amongst the public and also there's an acknowledgement around market stability that we would want the minister in place, said CHERREL AFRICA who is the Politics Head at the University of the Western Cape. In terms if he enjoys confidence of the president, formally there will be that acknowledgement that the minister has the confidence of the ANC of the President. eNCA

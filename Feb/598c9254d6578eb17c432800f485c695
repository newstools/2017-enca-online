STOCKHOLM - Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed computer hacker from the Millennium books, is back: the fifth time in the best-selling crime series will hit the streets on 7 September in 26 countries, publisher Norstedts said Friday.The book does not yet have an English title yet but its Swedish title translates as "The Man Who Searched for his Shadow", and is authored by David Lagercrantz."The new book starts with (Lisbeth Salander) serving a brief sentence at the women's prison Flodberga and she does everything she can to avoid the internal conflicts between the inmates," Norstedts wrote.Despite its title, the book delves "into the dark shadows of Salander's childhood", it said.READ: 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' sequel due this yearLagercrantz also wrote the fourth tome "The Girl in the Spider's Web", which came out in 2015, continuing the trilogy conceived by Stieg Larsson.The Millennium series, which chronicles the adventures of Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, made Larsson one of the world's best-loved crime writers.But the fame came posthumously, after Larsson's death of a heart attack in 2004, a year before the release of the first book in the series, "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo".While many Larsson fans rejoiced over the continuation of the trilogy when Lagercrantz was selected to write the fourth tome, some -- including Larsson's longtime partner,Eva Gabrielsson -- vehemently opposed him taking up the torch, calling him "a totally idiotic choice".A former journalist, Lagercrantz was previously best known for his biography of footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic.His fourth tome "The Girl in the Spider's Web" sold six million copies in 47 countries, and received mixed reviews.The fifth book has been sold to 34 countries. It will go on sale in 26 countries on September 7, including Britain, the United States and France.Lagercrantz has also signed on to write the sixth book in the series."Now I have Lisbeth in my blood," he told daily Dagens Nyheter.But he insisted the sixth tome would be his last."There will be no more," he said. "I want to be independent ... I want to do new things now."AFP

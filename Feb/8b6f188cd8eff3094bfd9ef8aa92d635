JOHANNESBURG The North Gauteng High Court has instructed the president and two cabinet ministers to revoke South Africa s withdrawal notice from the International Criminal Court. The ruling has somewhat vindicated the DA.On Wednesday, a Pretoria High Court judge declared invalid the government's decision to withdraw from the ICC.The DA said it welcomed the judgment. We find it inexplicable that a party that was at the forefront fighting for human rights during the armed struggle should find itself now in a situation where it defends people who have been found guilty or at least been charged with gross human rights violations borderline genocide we believe that we've completely lost our moral compass as a country and abrogated everything Madiba stood for in foreign policy and we find it shocking that we should even be in this courtroom challenging the withdrawal from the ICC, said DA federal executive chairperson James Selfe.READ: Judge stops SA exit from ICCThe DA said it will be investigating avenues to hold those responsible to account. This judgement also confirms yet another breach of the Constitution, this time Section 231, and only and illustrates the ANC s willingness to steamroll over the founding principles of our country. Clearly Zuma and his ANC have absolutely no respect for the Constitution, the party said in a statement.Meanwhile, government said it will study the judgment and decide whether or not to appeal.eNCA
